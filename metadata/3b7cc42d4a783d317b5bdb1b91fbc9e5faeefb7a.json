This is why guys that read it don't read or recommend anything else. Because the few men who &quot;get it&quot; spend the rest of their lives enjoying sexy girls in abundance Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and so can you. \n\nYou can learn to get ANY girl you want, the same way that all men who are naturally good with women have. The only difference is that you may learn it much FASTER, instead of wasting tons of time and money on fruitless dates or a new car/haircut/shirt that you BELIEVE will make you more attractive Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but really doesn't. \n\nYou see; men LACK success with women because they either don't understand what women are attracted to, or because they THINK that they do know, but have the wrong ideas and hence waste a lot of time - sometimes their entire life - chasing things they don't need. You know you have to get this book if you believe women want men with money, cars, or anything else that is manmade, because that doesn't make any sense. If women really were attracted to something unnatural, how did men meet women before any of those things were invented? \n\nThe approach you'll learn in The Manual is very different from conventional dating and the advice you find in the mainstream media because it focuses on natural attraction Ã¢â‚¬â€œ on what women REALLY want Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not what they CLAIM they want or what males in general BELIEVE women want. It incorporate menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s socialization and explains phenomenas such as why men think women are attracted to things such as money (yet money is a man-made invention that has not even EXISTED very long) and why women Ã¢â‚¬Å“play hard to getÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (a well-known phrase which amusingly reveals that women ARE easy but only pretend not to be). \n\nThis is why the beginning of the book addresses your basic beliefs and mindset, because if you learn to THINK correctly, you will automatically behave correctly around women. Even if they are so stunning they normally take your breath away, your mind goes blank, and you run out of words. \nYou already have what it takes to seduce women. Like, if you never run out of words around your close friends or family, you should be able to talk to a hot girl without making a fool out of yourself. The reason you seem to be a different person in such situations is because you ARE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you are NOT being yourself! You act differently because you were socialized to sabotage yourself. The Manual teaches you how to unlock your true potential and to bring out the real you Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not change you into someone you are not. \n\nThe method presented to get girls works on all women, no matter what language they speak, how young they are, or what type of relationship you might be looking for. It's universal because it's based on natural attraction, what all women are hardwired to respond to, and attraction is an emotion, not a decision. \n\nYou can use it to get a sexy girlfriend, one night stands or even long-term relationships. You can use it to find true love, a soul mate, or just casual sex without commitment. And one of its best benefits is that it will make women want to be with you and appreciate you. The girls you get will REMAIN attractive even after you have formed a sexual relationship with them, because they are so happy to be with you. While most other guys who do get (average) girls, often find themselves with an average female who becomes even less attractive over time as she stops taking care of herself completely. \n\nAll other dating books simply repeat conventional wisdom that doesn't work very well in reality, and even the best ones are about ACTING like an attractive man, not on how to BECOME one. But the problem is if you go around acting like someone besides yourself, even if you do start getting girls, it's not really YOU who are getting them. The Manual will show you how to get laid like a rock star, without being one, and without pretending to be one either.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b7cc42d4a783d317b5bdb1b91fbc9e5faeefb7a","amp;dn":"The+Manual-+What+Women+Want+-+W.+Anton+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b7cc42d4a783d317b5bdb1b91fbc9e5faeefb7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,124,196,45,74,120,61,49,123,91,219,27,145,251,201,229,250,238,251,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
