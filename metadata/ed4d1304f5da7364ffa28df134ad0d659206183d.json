The focus of the book is clearly on analysis of problems for \ndecision making, yet detailed explanations regarding how to use Excel tools are \nprovided. After many years of teaching and consulting, it is abundantly clear \nto me that for most students, a good example is worth its weight in gold. This \nbook contains many excellent examples in each chapter, some simple and others \nmore complex, and there is an abundance of exhibits to guide the student \nthrough the maze of steps necessary for each analysis. The content is quite \ndiverse: \u0007 data presentation - the Feng Shui of spreadsheets, effective \ncommunication and collaboration \u0007 data preparation - import, scrub, manipulate \ndata \u0007 data analysis - statistical methods: descriptive, inferential, and \npredictive, Design of Experiments \u0007 modeling - deterministic, probabilistic, \nWhat-if, Scenarios \u0007 simulation - quantifying uncertainty, Monte Carlo \nSimulation \u0007 optimization - constrained, Linear Programming, non-linear \nmodels, Goal Seek \u0007 Couple these features with detailed discussions of how to \nrealistically organize and extract insight from complex problems, and I \nbelieve you have a unique educational combination in one book.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed4d1304f5da7364ffa28df134ad0d659206183d","amp;dn":"EXCEL+DATA+ANALYSIS++MODELING+AND+SIMULATION-SPRINGER+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed4d1304f5da7364ffa28df134ad0d659206183d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,77,19,4,245,218,115,100,255,162,141,241,52,173,13,101,146,6,24,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
