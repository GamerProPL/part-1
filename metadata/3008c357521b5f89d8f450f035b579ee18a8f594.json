For some reason the stories might attract guys in the first place.. ItÃ‚Â´s the story about being someone or accieving something just to be able to get back to a decent household with wife and kids, much like the theme of traditional westernfilms. The main caracters of the life and struggle in the trailerpark is the smalltown gangsters Ricky &amp; Julian who usually canÃ‚Â´t escape their destiny to end up in jail in the end of each season. \n\nThis TV show might look like some documentary at a first glimpse, but ItÃ‚Â´s all a play with documentary conventions. The show adapted the main plot from a full length movie about Ricky &amp; Julian where julian is hiring a camera team to make a documentary about himself. Yet another full length film has been made after the TPB seasons 1 - 6. The caracters of Ricky (Robb Wells) and Julian (John Paul Tremblay)Is actually part of the real production team behind the show and the two movies. \n\n/Ola","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3008c357521b5f89d8f450f035b579ee18a8f594","amp;dn":"Trailer+Park+Boys+-+Season+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3008c357521b5f89d8f450f035b579ee18a8f594","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,8,195,87,82,27,95,137,216,244,80,240,53,181,121,238,24,168,245,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
