He and his trusted friend, Dr. Watson, step from HolmesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comfortable quarters at 221b Baker Street into the swirling fog of Victorian London to exercise that unique combination of detailed observation, vast knowledge, and brilliant deduction. Inevitably, Holmes rescues the innocent, confounds the guilty, and solves the most perplexing puzzles known to literature.\n\nVolume I of The Complete Sherlock Holmes starts with HolmesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first appearance, A Study in Scarlet, a chilling murder novel complete with bloodstained walls and cryptic clues, followed by the baffling The Sign of Four, which introduces HolmesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cocaine problem and WatsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future wife. The story collections The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes feature such renowned tales as Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Scandal in Bohemia,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Red-Headed League,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Musgrave Ritual.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nTired of writing stories about Holmes, his creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, killed him off at the end of Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Final Problem,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the last tale in The Memoirs. But the public outcry was so great that eight years later he published the masterful The Hound of the Baskervilles, which supposedly takes place before HolmesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death.\n\nThe separate Volume II of The Complete Sherlock Holmes collects the remaining accounts of HolmesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exploits, including Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Adventure of the Empty House,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which reveals the elaborate circumstances behind HolmesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s literary resurrection.\n\nThis volume also includes two other collections of Holmes stories, His Last Bow and The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes; Conan DoyleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final full-length Holmes novel, The Valley of Fear; a pair of parodies, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Field BazaarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“How Watson Learned the TrickÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; and two essays about the Ã¢â‚¬Å“private lifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of the beloved sleuth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c91a5d226d1e32e1f2477c08a82718729cd9e09b","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Sherlock+Holmes+-+Sir+Arthur+Conon+Doyle.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c91a5d226d1e32e1f2477c08a82718729cd9e09b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,26,93,34,109,30,50,225,242,71,124,8,168,39,24,114,156,217,224,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
