It intelligently smoothens and removes imperfections while preserving skin texture and other important portrait details such as hair, eyebrows, eyelashes etc.\n\nPortraiture features a powerful masking tool that enables selective smoothening only in the skin tone areas of the image. What makes PortraitureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s masking tool truly unique is its built-in Auto-Mask feature. It helps you quickly discover most of the skin tone range of the image automatically and, if preferred, you can manually fine-tune it to ensure optimal results, providing unmatched precision and productivity.\n\nFor finer control, you can specify the smoothening degree for different detail sizes and adjust the sharpness, softness, warmth, brightness and contrast.\n\nPortraiture comes with pre-defined presets for one-click effects and, as with all Imagenomic plugins, you can capture your own signature workflow in a custom preset tailored to your specific requirements and photographic portfolio.\n\nPortraiture 2 Features\nPortraiture 2 not only looks different, it features plenty of improvements under the surface as well.\n\n* Multiprocessor support for maximum retouching speed and workflow performance.\n* Enhanced skin masking control that isolates adjustments to just the skin mask, in addition to global adjustments\n* Preset power and the flexibility to create, capture and share custom settings with the new Preset Manager.\n* New Preference Settings, including customizable latitude adjustments for mask defaults, and User Interface skins and image display preferences.\n\n\nOperating systems : Windows Vista / Windows 7 / Windows 8\n\nCompatible host programs : Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2 / 3 / 4\n\nLanguage : English\n\nHomepage :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagenomic.com/pt.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagenomic.com/pt.aspx&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49ba494a38ad60b05b4dfba860a1f7e665ab0084","amp;dn":"Imagenomic+Portraiture+2.3.08+Plugin+for+Lightroom+%5BChingLiu%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49ba494a38ad60b05b4dfba860a1f7e665ab0084","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,186,73,74,56,173,96,176,91,77,251,168,96,161,247,230,101,171,0,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
