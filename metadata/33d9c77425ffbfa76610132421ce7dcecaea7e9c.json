David Reyne soon left and was replaced by Bill McDonough (drums, percussion). They were later joined by his brother Guy McDonough (vocals, rhythm guitar). The band was named after the front crawl swimming style also known as the Australian crawl. \n\nPlease SEED for others to Enjoy! \nCheers, Bubanee\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    Australian Crawl - Crawl File\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Australian Crawl\nAlbum................: Crawl File\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1994\nRipper...............: dBpowerAmp\nCodec................: LAME 3.98\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: MP3 VBRV0\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v2.3\nInformation..........:\nRipped by............: Bubanee\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
