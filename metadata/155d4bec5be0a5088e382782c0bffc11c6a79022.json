A man comes in his way, and Mitch hits. Without knowing how to act, and thinking he had not been seen by anyone, it leaves the body in the street and flees. In the following days, another man, Clinton (Samuel L. Jackson) is framed for murder, and the lawyer called to defend him is just Mitch. \n\nTitle in Brazil: A Perfect Alibi \nOriginal title: Reasonable Doubt \nYear of Production: 2014 \nRelease Date in Brazil: 2014 \nGenre: Thriller \nDuration: 101min \nDirected by: Peter A.
