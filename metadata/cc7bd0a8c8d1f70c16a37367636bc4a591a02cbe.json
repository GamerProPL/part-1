Over the centuries, many hundreds have expired inside dank, rat-infested cells, or while &quot;dancing the Tyburn jig&quot; at the end of a swinging rope, and many of the sites have become bywords for infamy. From the Tower and Newgate prison to the Clink and the Fleet, this book explores Londonâ€™s criminal heritage; including the stocks and pillories that lie, almost forgotten, in churchyards and squares across the city, it is a heartbreaking survey of the nationâ€™s penal history. Richly illustrated and filled with victims and villains, nobles, executioners, and torturers, it will delight historians, travelers, and armchair travelers alike","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc7bd0a8c8d1f70c16a37367636bc4a591a02cbe","amp;dn":"Olde+London+Punishments","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc7bd0a8c8d1f70c16a37367636bc4a591a02cbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,123,208,168,200,209,247,12,22,163,115,103,99,107,196,165,145,160,44,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
