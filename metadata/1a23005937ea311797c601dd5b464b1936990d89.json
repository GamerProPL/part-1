A team of international scientists is poised for the most fantastic adventure in human history. After years of scanning the galaxy for signs of somebody or something else, this team believes they've found a message from an intelligent source--&amp; they travel deep into space to meet it. Pulitzer Prize winner Carl Sagan injects Contact, his prophetic adventure story, with scientific details that make it utterly believable. It's a Cold War era novel that parlays the nuclear paranoia of the time into exquisitely wrought tension among the various countries involved. Sagan meditates on science, religion &amp; government--the elements that define society--&amp; looks to their impact on &amp; role in the future. His ability to pack an exciting read with such rich content is an unusual talent that makes Contact a modern sci-fi classic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a23005937ea311797c601dd5b464b1936990d89","amp;dn":"Contact+-+Carl+Sagan.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a23005937ea311797c601dd5b464b1936990d89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,35,0,89,55,234,49,23,151,198,1,221,91,70,75,25,54,153,13,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
