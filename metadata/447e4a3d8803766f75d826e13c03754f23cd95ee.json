In dating and attraction, body language forms the perfect foundation. If you are only picking up on what is being said, you are missing more than half of the message. It is pinnacle that you understand the subconscious as it is often much more reliable than spoken words. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t miss the signals, and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be left wondering and guessing.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:447e4a3d8803766f75d826e13c03754f23cd95ee","amp;dn":"The+Body+Language+Project%3A+Dating%2C+Attraction+and+Sexual+Body+La","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"447e4a3d8803766f75d826e13c03754f23cd95ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,126,74,61,136,3,118,111,117,216,38,225,60,3,117,79,35,205,149,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
