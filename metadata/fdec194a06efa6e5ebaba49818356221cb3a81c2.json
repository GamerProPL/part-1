Two other singles from the album followed, &quot;Ants Marching&quot; and &quot;Satellite&quot;.\n\nThe album's title comes from a line in the song &quot;Ants Marching&quot;: &quot;He remembers being small / playing under the table and dreaming.&quot;\n\nThe album was dedicated &quot;In memory of Anne&quot; for Matthews' older sister Anne, who was killed by her husband in 1994 in a murder-suicide. Included in the jewel case packet is a picture of Dave Matthews and one of Anne's children.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe acoustic guitar tracks on the album were played by Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds. During the recording sessions, Matthews and Reynolds would sit face-to-face with a piece of glass between them, playing the same guitar part. This was done twice for each song, resulting in four acoustic guitar tracks (two from Matthews, two from Reynolds) all playing the same part on each song. Producer Steve Lillywhite frequently turned down the volume on Matthews' parts and turned up the volume on Reynolds' parts, resulting in Reynolds' guitar playing being more prominent on the final album. Reynolds then overdubbed additional acoustic and electric guitar parts.\n\nMatthews has stated during performances that the harmonica solo performed by John Popper on &quot;What Would You Say&quot; was done in only five to ten minutes, while Matthews was in the bathroom.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Dave Matthews ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, acoustic guitar\n    * Carter Beauford ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, percussion, vocals\n    * Stefan Lessard ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\n    * LeRoi Moore ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ saxophone, soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone, vocals, flute\n    * Boyd Tinsley ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ acoustic violin, vocals\n\nAdditional Personnel\n\n    * Tim Reynolds ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ acoustic guitar\n    * John Popper ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ harmonica on &quot;What Would You Say&quot;\n    * John Alagia ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ additional vocals on &quot;Dancing Nancies&quot; and &quot;What Would You Say&quot;\n    * Michael McDonald ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ additional vocals &quot;Dancing Nancies&quot; &amp; &quot;What Would You Say&quot;\n    * Andrew Page ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ additional vocals on &quot;Dancing Nancies&quot; and &quot;What Would You Say&quot;\n    * Jeff Thomas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ additional vocals on &quot;Dancing Nancies&quot; and &quot;What Would You Say&quot;\n    * Steve Forman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ additional percussion on &quot;Typical Situation&quot;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdec194a06efa6e5ebaba49818356221cb3a81c2","amp;dn":"Dave+Matthews+Band+-+Under+The+Table+And+Dreaming+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdec194a06efa6e5ebaba49818356221cb3a81c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,236,25,74,6,239,166,229,235,171,164,152,24,53,98,33,203,58,129,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
