Weâ€™re more health conscious than ever before, and no matter which way we turn weâ€™re bombarded with promises of the best thing for living longer and healthier lives. But the truth is, the messages are flawed and if we follow them, we wonâ€™t achieve the good health we long for. Something, somewhere, has gone horribly wrong. At last, cutting through the misinformation, The Health Delusion has the answers, all backed by hard science. It exposes the shocking truths behind our diet, health and pharmaceutical industries â€“ and how they consistently put our health in jeopardy in favour of boosting their profits, as well as showing how the media makes things even worse by misleading us at every turn. So how can we put things right? Providing a complete 21st-century guide to optimal health at every stage of life, The Health Delusion gives us the real story, and offers us a detailed plan of the foods, supplements and lifestyle changes needed for total wellness.\r\n\r\nThe Health Delusion: How to Achieve Exceptional Health in the 21st Century by Glen Matten, Aidan Goggins\r\nEnglish | 2012 | ISBN-10: 1848506864| 304 pages | ePUB | 740 KB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b819708c6a726249ad362aeba7bfc09503021c38","amp;dn":"The+Health+Delusion%3A+How+to+Achieve+Exceptional+Health+in+the+21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b819708c6a726249ad362aeba7bfc09503021c38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,25,112,140,106,114,98,73,173,54,42,235,167,191,192,149,3,2,28,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
