Angela Dodson who needs his help to prove that her twin sister Isabel's death was not a suicide. The dead woman was a devout Catholic and Angela refuses to accept she would have taken her own life. She's asked Constantine for help because he has a reputation for dealing with the mystical. In fact, he is a demon hunter whose sole purpose on Earth is to send demons back to the nether regions. John himself has been to Hell - as a young man he too committed suicide and now knows that he is destined to return there on his death - but hopes his good deeds may somehow find him a place in Heaven. As he looks into Isabel's death, he realises demons are trying to break through to the human world, and his battles lead him into a direct conflict with Satan.\r\n\r\ncast\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves:...John Constantine\r\nRachel Weisz:...Angela Dodson\r\nShia LaBeouf:...Chas Kramer\r\nTilda Swinton:...Gabriel\r\nPruitt Taylor Vince:...Father Hennessy\r\nDjimon Hounsou:...Papa Midnite\r\nGavin Rossdale:...Balthazar\r\nPeter Stormare:...Lucifer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo:-\r\n\r\nFormat :mkv/AVC \r\nWriting Library :x264    \r\nDuration : 2h 00mn 47s \r\nBitrate :  3 038 Kbps  \r\nResolution=Width/Height : 1 920  x  794 pixels \r\nFrame Rate : 23.976 fps\r\n\r\nAudio:-\r\n\r\nFormat : AC-3 \r\nBitrate :  640 Kbps\r\nChannels : 6 Channels\r\nChannel Positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE \r\nSample Rate : 48KHz\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nRelease info:-\r\n\r\nEncoded/Released By :tomcat12/ETRG \r\nTitle/Year : &quot;Constantine&quot; / 2005\r\nFile Size : 3.10 GiB \r\nGenre : Drama | Fantasy | Horror | Thriller  \r\nSource : Blu-ray CEE - HDmonSK [Thanks]\r\nChapters : Yes \r\nSample : Yes \r\nSubtitles(VobSub): English(SDH),Polish,Romanian,Russian,Serbian,Slovenian,Thai,Greek.\r\nSubtitles(VobSub): Chinese,Korean,Portuguese,Arabic,Indonesian,Bulgarian,Croatian.\r\nSubtitles(VobSub): Czech,Estonian,Hebrew,Hungarian,Icelandic,Latvian,Lithuanian.\r\nIMDB :   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360486/\r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/a8ny \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/a8nL \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/a8nQ \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/a8nR \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/a8nm \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/a8ni \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/a8nl \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/a8nI \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/a8nd\r\n        \r\n\r\nGreetz To: SaM |ozi|juggs|LRS|SureNdrA|Psix|Masta|MgB|Hand_of_Doom|BADASSMEDIA|FWOLF|Extratorrent|.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMake sure it is Genuine ETRG release @ ExtraTorrent.cc or from our Trusted Accounts elswhere","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:880f12b6d08ec27ba0c6b3fca674e85a65666cbc","amp;dn":"Constantine.2005.1080p.BluRay.AC3.x264-ETRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"880f12b6d08ec27ba0c6b3fca674e85a65666cbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,15,18,182,208,142,194,123,160,198,179,252,166,116,232,90,101,102,108,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
