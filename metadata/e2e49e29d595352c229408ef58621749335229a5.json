For something supposedly so brilliant and evolutionarily advanced, the human brain is pretty messy, fallible and disorganised. For example, your memory is egotistical. No, really.\r\nConspiracy theories and superstitions are the inevitable effects of a healthy brain. And alcohol can actually improve your memory.**\r\nIn The Idiot Brain, neuroscientist Dean Burnett tours our mysterious and mischievous grey (and white) matter. Along the way he explains the human brain's imperfections in all their glory and how these influence everything we say, do and experience. Expertly researched and entertainingly written, this book is for anyone who has wondered why their brain appears to be sabotaging their life and what on earth it is really up to.\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/shtihl22\r\n\r\n=======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2e49e29d595352c229408ef58621749335229a5","amp;dn":"The+Idiot+Brain+A+Neuroscientist+Explains+What+Your+Head+is+Real","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2e49e29d595352c229408ef58621749335229a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,228,158,41,213,149,53,44,34,148,8,239,88,98,23,73,51,82,41,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
