Steeped in the rootsy West Coast pop, folk, and country traditions of bands like The Byrds and The Beach Boys, but able to hold their own amongst more expansive, stadium-ready indie rockers like Arcade Fire and the aforementioned Sharpe, The Mowgli's released their full-length studio debut, Sound the Drum, along with an EP, Love's Not Dead, in 2012. In 2013, The Mowgli's returned with their sophomore album, Waiting for the Dawn.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:664e62ef1fa884c20cd1baddbd00d0aefe235b57","amp;dn":"The+Mowgli%27s+-+2+Albums+%5BMP3+V0%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"664e62ef1fa884c20cd1baddbd00d0aefe235b57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,78,98,239,31,168,132,194,12,209,186,221,189,0,208,174,254,35,91,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
