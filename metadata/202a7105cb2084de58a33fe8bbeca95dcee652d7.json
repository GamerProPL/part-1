This is a copy from the original ABC master tapes taken straight from their vaults. This program is complete and unchanged from its television showing and still contains spots for commercials and such, so it is the real deal. There are plenty of copies of the Shea Stadium show around but this DVD provides the highest quality sound and video I have seen and is not chopped up or edited. All credit goes to Darthdisc as he is the creator of this DVD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:202a7105cb2084de58a33fe8bbeca95dcee652d7","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+at+Shea+Stadium+ABC+Master","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"202a7105cb2084de58a33fe8bbeca95dcee652d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,42,113,5,203,32,132,222,88,163,63,232,187,236,169,93,206,230,82,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
