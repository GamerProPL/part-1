Effects like Animal Fur, Smoke, and Reptile Skin are rendered in exquisite detail down to individual hairs, turbulent wisps, and shiny scales.\n\nEye Candy helps you quickly explore and design looks. In Eye Candy 7, effects are chosen through easy to recognize icons rather than text menus. Presets are rapidly previewed by simply mousing over them. The theme is less clicking and more visual browsing.\n\nWhat's Already Great\n\nRealistic Effects - Realism sets Eye Candy effects apart from the generic filters built into Photoshop. Effects like Animal Fur, Smoke, and Reptile Skin are rendered in exquisite detail down to individual hairs, turbulent wisps, and shiny scales. Eye Candy helps designs look natural and organic. \n\nZillions of Effects - Eye Candy has grown over 19 years to handle a huge range of graphic design tasks, from subtle extruded edges to glitzy chrome. There are 32 effect categories, over 1000 presets, and controls to let you create an unlimited number of your own styles. Take a look at our examples for just a sample of what Eye Candy can do. \n\nAdaptation - Eye Candy scales effects to match the size of your current artwork. That makes it less likely that you will have to tweak a preset to make it look good. \n\nNon-Destructive Editing - Effects are drawn into a new layer, leaving your original artwork untouched. Eye Candy can also work as a Smart Filter, which lets you modify or remove the effect later. You can save presets to consistently recreate your favorite looks. \n\nProfessional Features - Eye Candy can handle images in CMYK mode and 16-bits/channel, which are needed for professional print work.\n\nWhat's New\n\nEven Easier - We completely rewrote the Eye Candy user interface to make it easier to explore. The theme is less clicking and more visual browsing.\n\nEye Candy 7 is now a single entry in PhotoshopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s filter menu. That means that you can explore all of our effects without leaving the Eye Candy window. Instead of choosing an effect category by reading a text list, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see icons that show typical uses of each effect. Click the image below to see the full size as it appears in Eye Candy 7.\n\nOnce you choose an effect, you can explore presets fast using the navigator, which is a small preview that instantly updates. You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even have to click. Just mouse over preset names and the navigator shows how the effect will look in your design. In the screenshot below you can see the navigator in the lower left. Click the image to see more detail.\n\nIn the preference panel you can choose how the effect is rendered in a new layer. If you prefer the Eye Candy 5 approach, you can have the new layer include just the effect and not a copy of your original artwork.\n\nMany Eye Candy effects use transparency, so we moved the transparency display control out of the preference panel and put it under the main preview. This lets you quickly switch the background between checkerboard, black, white, or a custom solid color.\n\nNew Effects - By popular demand, we rescued the best effects from our discontinued Xenofex product: Lightning, Electrify (seen above), and Clouds. We rewrote them for our new Eye Candy 7 framework, which provides faster previewing, better preset management, and easier experimentation.\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n- Windows 7 or newer\n- 1280x768 or greater monitor resolution\n- Intel Core 2 processor\n\nHost Requirements\n\nThis product requires one of the following host applications: \n- Adobe Photoshop CS5 or newer\n- Adobe Photoshop Elements 10 or newer\n\nLanguage : English\n\nHomepage :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alienskin.com/eyecandy/index.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alienskin.com/eyecandy/index.aspx&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edb104d9b10635a2ea641cd665751900626590b1","amp;dn":"Alien+Skin+Eye+Candy+7.1.0.1191+%2832+-+64+bit%29+%5BChingLiu%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edb104d9b10635a2ea641cd665751900626590b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,177,4,217,177,6,53,162,234,100,28,214,101,117,25,0,98,101,144,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
