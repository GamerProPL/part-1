To go further and get full control, you need child themes. A WordPress child theme is a mini-theme that piggybacks off an existing theme. This means rather than writing all the code from scratch, you just write a new child of an original parent theme, updating only the parts you want.â€¨â€¨WordPress: Building Child Themes opens the world of child theme development to anyone, no matter what level of experience or expertise. It helps you build your child theme on top of an existing properly coded foundation, and create stylish new WordPress sitesâ€”without the advanced knowledge of a web developer. Morten Rand-Hendriksen explains how to get started picking a parent theme, updating the CSS, creating a new template for your child theme, and updating its functionality. By the end of this practical, project-based course, you should have a functioning child theme and the skills to quickly customize your next WordPress site. \r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tWhat is a child theme?\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating and activating a child theme\r\n\tâ€¢\tOverriding or overwriting?\r\n\tâ€¢\tChanging existing styles\r\n\tâ€¢\tAdding new styles\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating templates for the child theme\r\n\tâ€¢\tAdding new menus and widgets\r\n\tâ€¢\tReplacing custom web fonts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb8ec5602fd1d85c6d02d6b33dad7c3b0c70e2f7","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+WordPress%3A+Building+Child+Themes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb8ec5602fd1d85c6d02d6b33dad7c3b0c70e2f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,142,197,96,47,209,216,92,109,2,214,179,61,173,124,59,12,112,226,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
