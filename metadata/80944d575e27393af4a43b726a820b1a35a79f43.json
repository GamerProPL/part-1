There is a civil war going on and Jordan who has joined up on the side that appeals most to idealists of that era -- like Ernest Hemingway and his friends -- has been given a high-risk assignment up in the mountains. He awaits the right time to blow up a bridge in a cave. Pilar, who is in charge there, has an ability to foretell the future. And so that night she encourages Maria, a young girl ravaged by enemy soldiers, to join Jordan who has decided to spend the night under the stars. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80944d575e27393af4a43b726a820b1a35a79f43","amp;dn":"For+Whom+the+Bell+Tolls+%281943%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80944d575e27393af4a43b726a820b1a35a79f43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,148,77,87,94,39,57,58,244,164,59,114,106,130,11,26,53,167,159,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
