Also included is an album of all-acoustic versions of the album \\'Shadows Collide with People\\'. This acoustic version was released online only, on John\\'s official website.\n\nI honestly think John is the most amazing musician alive today. He is a constant source of inspiration for me, not only as a fellow guitarist and musician, but as a person. His music has gotten me through some very difficult times and it\\'ll be with me forever.\n\nRemember, support music. If you like it, buy it. Especially these albums....most were recorded on analog tape, and .mp3s simply can\\'t do justice to hearing the music on vinyl. Believe me...go out, get yourself a record player and the records on vinyl, and you will be amazed.\n\nAlso, all the album artwork is included in each folder. Furthermore, I\\'ve painstakingly gone through each file and written in all the album info. Just move all the downloaded .mp3s to the folder where you keep all your music, then import into iTunes/WMP/etc. It\\'s all organized and you don\\'t have to worry about going through and having to rename and reorganize every song. It\\'s all taken care of.\n\nThanks for listening to amazing music. \nPeace \\'n love.\n\npanza32\n\n---\nNiandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt (1994)\nSmile from the Streets You Hold (1997)\nTo Record Only Water for Ten Days (2001)\nFrom the Sounds Inside (2001)\nShadows Collide with People (2004)\nShadows Collide with People - acoustic (2004)\nThe Will to Death (2004)\nDC EP (2004)\nInside of Emptiness (2004)\nA Sphere in the Heart of Silence (2004)\nCurtains (2005)\nThe Empyrean (2009)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed8637eef2f12cf754644f6635f4d0aeef55801f","amp;dn":"John+Frusciante+complete+studio+discography+%2B+other%2812+albums%2C+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed8637eef2f12cf754644f6635f4d0aeef55801f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,134,55,238,242,241,44,247,84,100,79,102,53,244,208,174,239,85,128,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
