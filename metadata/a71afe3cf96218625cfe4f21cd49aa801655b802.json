But those whose lives really do change in dramatic ways can almost always trace the change back to something much simpler. One subtle, unsuspecting moment. One episode, one realization, one action. One seemingly insignificant step that put them on a completely different path... and ultimately led them to their dreams.\n\nIf you know you want something in your life to change, then all you need is just such a moment. The good news is you don't have to wait for it to show up. You can make that magical, transformational moment appear. And you can do it right now - today!\n\nIn The Day That Turns Your Life Around, esteemed motivational master Jim Rohn shares the essential elements of a life-changing day with you, and shows you how to consciously create the conditions that make dramatic, lasting personal transformation not merely possible, but inevitable.\n\nIn this powerful and compelling program, you will discover the four emotional states that can change your life, and how to generate them within yourself at will, rather than waiting for external circumstances to activate them (something which may never happen).\n\nOnce you've put yourself in the ideal emotional state, Jim will show you how to direct that momentum toward the specific circumstances of your life that you want to change. Using the unique and powerful set of tools he provides, you'll be able to target any situation with laser-like focus and begin to transform it instantaneously.\n\nWith the wit, wisdom, and down-to-earth insights that have made him famous, Jim covers it all - from how to sail through the coming Social Security crisis, to improving your marriage, to living a life of true style, grace, and professionalism. Wherever you're looking to change, you'll find the tools to make that change happen immediately.\n\nThe Day That Turns Your Life Around marks a new direction in the work of Jim Rohn. He has stepped off the stage and into the intimate surroundings of a studio, for a conversational presentation of ideas and strategies he's covering for the first time anywhere!\n\nThe result is an amazingly powerful listening experience. You'll feel as if Jim is right in the same room, speaking directly to you in a one-on-one coaching session focused on your unique goals, needs, and challenges.\n\nThere's no reason for you to live with lack, unhappiness, or dissatisfaction - no matter how great or small. At any moment, you can choose to transform any circumstance in your life. The Day That Turns Your Life Around will give you the tools and information to achieve any change you want to.
