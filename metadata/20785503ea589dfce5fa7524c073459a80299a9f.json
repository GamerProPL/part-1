The 400 Blows stars Jean-Pierre LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©aud as Antoine Doinel, Truffaut's preteen alter ego. Misunderstood at home by his parents and tormented in school by his insensitive teacher (Guy Decomble), Antoine frequently runs away from both places. The boy finally quits school after being accused of plagiarism by his teacher. He steals a typewriter from his father (Albert Remy) to finance his plans to leave home. The father angrily turns Antoine over to the police, who lock the boy up with hardened criminals. A psychiatrist at a delinquency center probes Antoine's unhappiness, which he reveals in a fragmented series of monologues. Originally intended as a 20-minute short, The 400 Blows was expanded into a feature when Truffaut  decided to elaborate on his self-analysis. For the benefit of Truffaut's fellow film buffs, The 400 Blows is full of brief references to favorite directors, notably Truffaut's then-idol Jean Vigo. The film won the 1959 Best Director prize at the Cannes Film Festival, even though Truffaut  had been declared persona non grata the year before for his inflammatory comments about the festival's commercialism.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053198/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053198/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-53198/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-53198/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:39:25\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x432  1.67:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 971 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,11 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20785503ea589dfce5fa7524c073459a80299a9f","amp;dn":"Les+quatre+cents+coups+%281959%29+The+400+Blows+Fr+Eng+subt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20785503ea589dfce5fa7524c073459a80299a9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,120,85,3,234,88,157,252,229,250,117,36,192,115,69,154,128,41,154,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
