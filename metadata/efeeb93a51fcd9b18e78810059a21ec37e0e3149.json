While America got the double\ndisc set, Europe received a streamlined, single disc collection, The Best Of (Once In A\nLifetime). As its title suggests, the fourteen track collection focuses solely on the group's best\nknown tracks, including such classics as &quot;Psycho Killer,&quot; their commercial breakthrough cover\nof Al Green's &quot;Take Me to the River,&quot; &quot;Once In A Lifetime,&quot; and &quot;Burning Down the House,&quot;\namong others. But the inclusion of a pair of oddities, &quot;Sax and Violins&quot; and &quot;Lifetime Piling\nUp,&quot; will raise a few eyebrows, especially with such a backlog of stronger material that very\neasily could have fit alongside the renowned hits (namely &quot;Memories Can't Wait,&quot; &quot;Crosseyed\nand Painless,&quot; &quot;Swamp,&quot; &quot;Girlfriend is Better,&quot; etc.). But by and large, for a single disc\ncollection, The Best Of (Once In A Lifetime) accomplishes its goal -- hopefully one day a\nslightly more expanded version will see a stateside release.\n\n \n                 \n\n   1.
