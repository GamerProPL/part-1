Sold into slavery and forced to labor endlessly turning the massive Wheel of Pain, he grows tall and strong. After fighting as a gladiator, and being taught swordsmanship, he is freed. Wandering about the land, he soon finds an able companion, the nimble archer Subotai (Gerry Lopez), and a lover, the beautiful warrior Valeria (Sandahl Bergman). They all live it up as daring thieves for awhile, but fate eventually leads Conan to the formidable temple of Thulsa Doom and his serpent cult, thereby pitting our hero against the man who had taken everything from him, including his freedom, all those years ago.\n\n  Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sandahl Bergman, James Earl Jones, Gerry Lopez, Mako.\n\n  Directed by: John Milius.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 2hr. 10min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 688 x 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5077543422e8b24e038e41d5284837dae5214cbb","amp;dn":"Conan+the+Barbarian+%281982%29+%28Arnold+Schwarzenegger%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5077543422e8b24e038e41d5284837dae5214cbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,119,84,52,34,232,178,78,3,142,65,213,40,72,55,218,229,33,76,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
