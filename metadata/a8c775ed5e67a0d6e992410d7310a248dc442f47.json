Simon Allardice uses JavaScript to explore the core syntax of a programming language, and shows how to write and execute your first application and understand whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going on under the hood. The course covers creating small programs to explore conditions, loops, variables, and expressions; working with different kinds of data and seeing how they affect memory; writing modular code; and how to debug, all using different approaches to constructing software applications.\n\nFinally, the course compares how code is written in several different languages, the libraries and frameworks that have grown around them, and the reasons to choose each one.\n\nTopics include:\n* Writing source code\n* Understanding compiled and interpreted languages\n* Requesting input\n* Working with numbers, characters, strings, and operators\n* Writing conditional code\n* Making the code modular\n* Writing loops\n* Finding patterns in strings\n* Working with arrays and collections\n* Adopting a programming style\n* Reading and writing to various locations\n* Debugging\n* Managing memory usage\n* Learning about other languages","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8c775ed5e67a0d6e992410d7310a248dc442f47","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+Foundations+of+Programming+%3A+Fundamentals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8c775ed5e67a0d6e992410d7310a248dc442f47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,199,117,237,94,103,160,214,233,146,65,13,115,16,162,72,220,68,47,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
