Players will have to keep in line and juggle their time sensibly as they form their personal plan of escape; working out potential routes to use as well as being incredibly smart and clever in using what seem like harmless items to craft and create various weaponry and escape tools which help aid the player in their ultimate goal of escaping. Players are tasked with advancing their character's statistics through various means such as exercising regularly and ensuring to boost their intellect as well... Whilst remembering to attend roll call, hold down their job and keep the inmates on side if you're to be successful in trading with them and ultimately... Don't forget to escape!&quot;\n\nv0.759 changelog:\nAdditions\n- Janitor job added\n- Mailman job added\n- Center Perks Prison added\n- In game help files added to pause menu\nChanges\n- Lowered OPN gain of giving cooked food\n- Balancing work done on job payouts and int requirements\n- Disguises - Only gain heat if nearby others or cameras\n- NPC speech differs while disguised\n- Guards with high opinion donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t intervene when witnessing you attack\n- Updates to heat punishment code to account for prison difficulty\n- Updates to Job Quota difficulty to account for different prisons\n- Stats decay a little slower\n- Super glue can now be sold by inmates\n- Reduced decay rate of File a little\n- Popup tutorial tips only shown on the first prison (Center Perks)\nBugfixes\n- Pick up desks in vents fixed\n- Can enter hole underneath poster/fake wall\n- Holes overlap fake wall tile\n- Unable to enter vent it overlaps hole fixed\n- Indestructible fake vent\n- Fixed post busted while disguised heat raise\n- Disabled key remapping to some problematic keys\n- Typo in Sturdy Shovel crafting note\n- Guards don't recognize canteen as part of kitchen job area fixed\n- Cancel favour OPN drop Bug fixed\n- Correct spelling of 'die' instead of 'dice'\n- Guard opinions drop when you attack them\n- Contraband bag decay Bug fixed\n- Job board wall can't be knocked through\n- Fixed dropping inmate/desk on removed wall spot\n- Workout progress dropping while menus open fixed\n\nIf you like the game, support the developer, buy it! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/298630/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/298630/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aa07434d9f87568ff51d22958bcb96288520bcd","amp;dn":"The+Escapists+v0.759","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aa07434d9f87568ff51d22958bcb96288520bcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,160,116,52,217,248,117,104,255,81,210,41,88,188,185,98,136,82,11,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
