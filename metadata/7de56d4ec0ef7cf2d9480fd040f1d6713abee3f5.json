Their history is littered with a succession of band members, substance abuse issues and several break-ups and reformations, but Steppenwolf endures to the present day.They started life in Canada in the early 60s as The Sparrows, but did not find fame until they had changed their name and released their eponymous debut in 1968. When two tracks, &quot;Born to be Wild&quot; and &quot;The Pusher&quot;, were used in the film Easy Rider, the success of the album was assured. It marked the first of five consecutive gold certified albums but after the release of For Ladies Only in 1971, the band split.They were back together by 1974 and started to release albums again, beginning with 1974's Slow Flux; but their heyday was past, and this album was to contain their last Top 40 hit, &quot;Straight Shootin' Woman&quot;. They tried to split after 1975's Hour of the Wolf but contractual commitments to the record label made them stick it out for 1976's Skullduggery. Another split followed, and yet another reformation followed that. The band's last album of new material was Summerdaze released in 1997 and prospects of further touring are in doubt following a 'farewell concert' in 2007.\n\nOrigin:\n\nToronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nLos Angeles, California, United States\n\n\nOriginal Band Members 1967-1969:\n\nJohn Kay ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lead vocals, rhythm guitar, harmonica  \nMichael Monarch ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lead guitar, backing vocals\nRushton Moreve ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass, backing vocals\nGoldy McJohn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards, backing vocals\nJerry Edmonton ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, backing vocals\n\nTrack List:\n\n1.
