Based in Philadelphia, Vile grew up outside the city in the nearby town of Lansdowne. His passion for music was encouraged by his father, a bluegrass aficionado who bought him a banjo. Vile eventually advanced from the banjo to other instruments, primarily guitar, and began writing songs that he would record at home. These lo-fi home recordings, often featuring drum machines and other one-man-band, lo-fi adornment, were compiled on a series of CD-Rs that Vile would release in limited editions. Meanwhile, in addition to his solo work, Vile began collaborating musically with singer/guitarist Adam Granduciel in 2003. Calling themselves the War on Drugs, Vile and Granduciel released an eponymous demo EP in 2005. Over time the War on Drugs grew to become a full-scale band, and following another self-released EP, Barrel of Batteries (2007), they made their full-length album debut with Wagonwheel Blues (2008) on the Secretly Canadian label.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tIndie Rock\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tMatador Records\t\t\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Baby's Arms\n02.Jesus Fever\n03.Puppet To The Man\n04.On Tour\n05.Society Is My Friend\n06.Runner Ups\n07.In My Time\n08.Peeping Tomboy\n09.Smoke Ring For My Halo\n10.Ghost Town\n11.(Shell Blues)\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5be61400cebc13b21ee335e58e89c2bcd3550583","amp;dn":"Kurt+Vile+-+Smoke+Rings+For+My+Halo+%282011%29+mp3+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5be61400cebc13b21ee335e58e89c2bcd3550583","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,230,20,0,206,188,19,178,30,227,53,229,142,137,194,188,211,85,5,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
