He was recently pictured with the 1947 Voice-o-Graph machine located at Third Man's Nashville headquarters, which could be the ancient electro mechanical technology referred to in the message. The machine allows users to make a vinyl recording of their own voice in real time.\n\nYoung has said that recording the album was &quot;one of the lowest-tech experiences I've ever had&quot;.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA Letter Home is the thirty-fifth studio album by Neil Young. It was released on April 19, 2014 on Record Store Day by Third Man Records.\nA Letter Home Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which features acoustic renditions of Bob DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Girl from the North Country,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Willie NelsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“On the Road AgainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and many other classics Ã¢â‚¬â€œ was recorded at Third Man Records on a refurbished 1947 Voice-O-Graph recording booth.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Imagine a very simple recording studio not much larger than a phone booth and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get the idea,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ reads a press release. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Recorded live to track to one-track, mono, the album has an inherent warm, primitive feel of a vintage Folkways recording.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nA Letter Home will be released on CD and digital album as well as a limited edition deluxe box set, which includes a special Ã¢â‚¬Å“direct feed from the boothÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ audiophile vinyl version and a DVD that captured the original electro-mechanical process, along with comments from the producers and recording engineers. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:716fbd9c6a2a6940210f76209173a47f31c90726","amp;dn":"Neil+Young+-+A+Letter+Home+%282014%29+%5BThird+Man+Records%5D+24Bit+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"716fbd9c6a2a6940210f76209173a47f31c90726","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,111,189,156,106,42,105,64,33,15,118,32,145,115,164,127,49,201,7,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
