My name is Don Tillman. I am forty-one years old. I have been married to Rosie Jarman, world's most perfect woman, for ten months and ten days.\n\nMarriage added significant complexity to my life. When we relocated to New York City, Rosie brought three maximum-size suitcases. We abandoned the Standardised Meal System and agreed that sex should not be scheduled in advance.\n\nThen Rosie told me we had 'something to celebrate', and I was faced with a challenge even greater than finding a partner.\n\nI have attempted to follow traditional protocols and have sourced advice from all six of my friends, plus a therapist and the internet.\n\nThe result has been a web of deceit. I am now in danger of prosecution, deportation and professional disgrace. \n\nAnd of losing Rosie forever.\nGenre: Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cee6dfdc08207eca4e5c7894a4fb589bfdf6a916","amp;dn":"Jon+Wakeham+-+The+Rosie+Effect+%28Epub%2C+Mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cee6dfdc08207eca4e5c7894a4fb589bfdf6a916","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,230,223,220,8,32,126,202,78,92,120,148,164,251,88,155,253,246,169,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
