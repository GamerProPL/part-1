After several drinks, Granduciel and Vile discovered their shared fascination with the Bard of Minnesota, and began working on songs together. By 2005, the pair had enough material to launch a proper band, and the War on Drugs were born. With Granduciel and Vile fronting the band, a variety of accompanists drifted in and out of the lineup before the War on Drugs settled on a stable lineup of Granduciel on vocals, guitar, and keyboards; Vile on guitar and vocals; Charlie Hall on organ and drums; Dave Hartley on bass, and Kyle Lloyd on drums and percussion. While the War on Drugs were hesitant to quit their jobs and begin touring extensively, the band became a frequent presence on the Philadelphia music scene and impressed out-of-towners during occasional gigs in New York City.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6eba4223293720dccc76498dfd9f8659c5d9bda5","amp;dn":"The+War+on+Drugs+-+Lost+in+the+Dream+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6eba4223293720dccc76498dfd9f8659c5d9bda5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,186,66,35,41,55,32,220,204,118,73,141,253,159,134,89,197,217,189,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
