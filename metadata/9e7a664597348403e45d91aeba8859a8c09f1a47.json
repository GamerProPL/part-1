He is also bored with little to do and only the most routine and trivial cases offered to him. Mrs. Hudson is so worried that she summons Dr. Watson, who suggests Holmes consider a trip to Vienna to visit a new doctor who seems to specialize in interpreting dreams, Sigmund Freud; but, Holmes is soon approached by Lord Robert St. Simon over the sudden disappearance of his wife, Hettie. They had only just married when his new bride became deeply disturbed upon leaving the church. He admits to also having had actress Flora Miller as his one-time mistress, a jilted lady who's lately been making trouble for him. He was also previously married, twice, with his first wife dying and his second marriage annulled. It's not till Sherlock receives a visit from Agnes Northcote, sister of Lord Robert's second wife Helena, that he fully realizes the extent of Lord St. Simon's barbarity. When he learns the true reason for Hettie's mood change on leaving the church, lives are suddenly at risk, and the solution to the mystery is at hand. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e7a664597348403e45d91aeba8859a8c09f1a47","amp;dn":"The+Eligible+Bachelor+%281993%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e7a664597348403e45d91aeba8859a8c09f1a47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,122,102,69,151,52,132,3,228,93,145,174,186,136,89,168,192,159,26,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
