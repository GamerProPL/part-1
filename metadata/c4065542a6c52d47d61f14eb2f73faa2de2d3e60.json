It is not expected to return.\nOfficial overview\n\nColin McRae Rally 2005 accelerates the series to a blinding speed that captures the sheer adrenaline of edge-of-control rallying and lets you take the stages at speeds a third faster than before. You won't be spinning off unnecessarily either, the stages have been designed to let you use that speed as you hurtle through the detailed international environments. However, crash out and you'll see the individual damage models for each car in action... right down to scraping the paintwork!\n\nDelivering more cars, more stages and new challenges, the adrenaline-pumping heart of Colin McRae Rally 2005 is the all-new multi-discipline Career Challenge. Taking players through their very own, fully professional rally career, you'll be driving the most diverse selection of rally cars from different manufacturers.\n\nColin Mcrae Rally 2005 is resolutely open and varied, so much that the traditional championship is almost a sideshow. A career mode sees you working from humble machinery to the fastest and finest, through a blizzard of cups, shields and performance-enhancing parts tests. There's hours of play. Months. Orbits.\nRelease information\nExtras\n\n    Manual (24 pages)\n    Avatars\n    Hi-res wallpapers (6 cars)\n    Screensaver \n\nPatches and modifications\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/forum/colin_mcrae_rally_2005/colin_mcrae_rally_2005_mods&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/forum/colin_mcrae_rally_2005/colin_mcrae_rally_2005_mods&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInstall and Play.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4065542a6c52d47d61f14eb2f73faa2de2d3e60","amp;dn":"Colin+McRae+Rally+2005+-+GOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4065542a6c52d47d61f14eb2f73faa2de2d3e60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,6,85,66,166,197,45,71,214,31,20,235,47,115,250,162,222,45,62,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
