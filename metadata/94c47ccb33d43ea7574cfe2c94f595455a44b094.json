HDR Efex Pro overcomes limitations in other software products with a revolutionary all-in-one approach and multiple tone mapping algorithms that enable realistic and artistic results to be created start-to-finish within a single tool. Introductory videos, free trial versions, and live online training can be found at www.niksoftware.com/hdrefexpro.\nHDR Efex Pro brings innovative and best-in-class technologies to HDR photography. HDR Efex Pro enables a wide variety of options, including single-click visual style presets, as well as global adjustments such as exposure, contrast, structure to fine detail contrast, and a new HDR Method option. This feature makes use of four tone-mapping algorithms, which enable virtually unlimited HDR Ã¢â‚¬Å“looksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that can be adapted to a particular HDR style of photography.\nNik SoftwareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s proprietary U PointÃ‚Â® technology is also incorporated into HDR Efex Pro 2, providing precise selective fine-tuning of images without the need for complicated selections or layer masks. Photographers can precisely control selective adjustments with a single mouse-click providing the ability to quickly create amazing results. Finishing adjustments, such as vignette controls and levels &amp; curves, make it possible to easily accomplish a range of enhancements within HDR Efex Pro.\nHDR Efex Pro 2 also enables photographers to create popular and dramatic HDR images from a single exposure. This feature allows photographers to reprocess a single image in which an exposure series was not previously shot or for subject matter that does not lend itself to multiple exposures.\n\nInfo:\n\n- Disconnect net.\n- Install\n- Run Patch.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/48342183122320066122.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/48342183122320066122.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94c47ccb33d43ea7574cfe2c94f595455a44b094","amp;dn":"Nik+Software+-+HDR+Efex+Pro+2.0.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94c47ccb33d43ea7574cfe2c94f595455a44b094","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,196,124,203,51,212,62,167,87,76,254,44,148,245,149,69,90,68,176,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
