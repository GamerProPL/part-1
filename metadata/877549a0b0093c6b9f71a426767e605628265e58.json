It is the first adventure game by LucasArts to use three-dimensional graphics overlaid on pre-rendered 2D computer backgrounds. As with other LucasArts adventure games, the player must converse with other characters and examine, collect, and use objects correctly to solve puzzles in the game in order to progress.\nGrim Fandango's world combines elements of Aztec beliefs of afterlife with style aspects of film noir, including The Maltese Falcon, On the Waterfront and Casablanca, to create the Land of the Dead, which recently departed souls, represented in the game as calaca-like figures, must travel through before they reach their final destination, the Ninth Underworld. The story follows travel agent Manuel &quot;Manny&quot; Calavera as he attempts to save Mercedes &quot;Meche&quot; Colomar, a newly arrived but virtuous soul, during her long journey.\n\nGrim Fandango takes place in the Land of the Dead, where recently departed souls make their way to the Ninth Underworld. For sinners, this is a four-year journey made on foot and many do not complete it, ending up taking jobs at way-points along the route. However, more virtuous souls receive assistance, the most virtuous getting passage on the &quot;Number Nine&quot; train (&quot;Double N&quot;) that cuts the journey down to four minutes. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world to Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year, on November 2, there is a large festival celebration of the Day of the Dead.\nThe souls in the Land of the Dead appear as skeletal calaca figures. Alongside them are demons that have been summoned to help with the more mundane tasks of day-to-day life, such as auto maintenance. The souls themselves can suffer death-within-death by being &quot;sprouted&quot;, the result of being shot with &quot;sproutella&quot;-filled darts that cause flowers to grow out through the bones. Many of the characters are Mexican and occasional Spanish words are interspersed into the English dialog, resulting in Spanglish. Many of the characters smoke, which follows a film noir tradition.\n\n-----------\n\n\n1. Mount the CD. Do NOT autorun.\n2. Run the GrimSetup1.0 (downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/grimfandangosetupandlauncher/  created by bengorman)\n3. Make sure &quot;run from hard drive&quot; is checked under the options menu in the launcher\n4. Run and enjoy the fantastic game of Grim Fandango!\n\n\nThe GrimSetup1.0 installer works on both 32 bit and 64 bit versions of Windows and has been tested on Windows XP and Vista. It should work fine with all Windows versions though. It performs a full install of the game, meaning that the cdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s are not needed to play. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:877549a0b0093c6b9f71a426767e605628265e58","amp;dn":"Grim+Fandango+%28eng%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"877549a0b0093c6b9f71a426767e605628265e58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,117,73,160,176,9,60,107,159,113,164,38,118,126,96,86,40,38,94,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
