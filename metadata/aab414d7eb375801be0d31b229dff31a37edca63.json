They both decide to make a &quot;Bucket List&quot;, a list of events they never accomplished in their lives. This list ranged from kissing the prettiest lady in the world to patching up the problems with their family.\n\nThe performances of this movie was phenomenal, but what really made this movie unique was the writing. We have all seen movies with a similar plot like in The Holiday when Queen Latifa spends all her money living like a Queen because she only has a few months to live. But instead the Bucket List is unique because it wasn&amp;#039;t that completing this list made their last year worth living, it was the fact that the writers focused on the chemistry of these two men and how their friendship increased while completing this list.\n\nThe witty dialog, the brilliant writing and the great performance really made this movie a post-Christmas treat.\n\n9/10\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aab414d7eb375801be0d31b229dff31a37edca63","amp;dn":"The.Bucket.List%5B2007%5DDvDrip-aXXo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aab414d7eb375801be0d31b229dff31a37edca63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,180,20,215,235,55,88,1,190,13,49,178,41,223,243,26,55,237,202,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
