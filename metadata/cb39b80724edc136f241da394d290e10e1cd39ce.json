It may be sufficient for beginners, but once you get a shade more familiar with it, you'll probably notice soon that a lot of things are missing. Things like copilot support, missed approaches, departure and arrival procedures (SIDs/STARs)...\nFlying online is better, but here you'll be on your own once there is no controller in charge for a certain frequency - and our experience is, that many frequencies are not supervised during a flight. There must be a better way...\nPRO-ATC/X replaces Air Traffic Control in FSX in an impressive manner. The implemented Flight Planner is able to calculate a whole route simply by defining departure and destination airports while editing a calculated route is still possible. PRO-ATC/X is designed to control aircraft flying under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).
