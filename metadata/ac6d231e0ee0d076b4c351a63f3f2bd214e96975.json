As the title suggests, this time the focus their cut-and-paste technique is the '60s obsession with getting into orbit. The first single is &quot;Gagarin,&quot; a tribute to Russian cosmonaut Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin, the first man to orbit the earth in a spacecraft. With samples from various radio and television broadcasts, J. Willgoose, Esq. and Wrigglesworth have concocted a very funky backing track for it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac6d231e0ee0d076b4c351a63f3f2bd214e96975","amp;dn":"Public+Service+Broadcasting+-+The+Race+For+Space+%5B2015%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac6d231e0ee0d076b4c351a63f3f2bd214e96975","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,109,35,30,14,224,208,118,180,195,81,166,63,63,43,210,20,233,105,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
