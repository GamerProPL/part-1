He won the 1932 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for his distinguished art of narration, which takes its highest form in The Forsyte Saga.&quot;\r\n\r\nHe is chiefly remembered today for his novels, particularly THE FORSYTE SAGA (1906-1921) and its sequels, A MODERN COMEDY (1924-1928) and END OF THE CHAPTER (1931-1933), which chronicle the lives of several generations of a large, upper middle-class family.  Only a few generations removed from their farmer ancestors, the family members are keenly aware of their status as &quot;new money&quot;.  Although sympathetic to his characters, he highlights their insular, snobbish, and acquisitive attitudes and their suffocating moral codes.  He is viewed as one of the first writers of the Edwardian era who challenged some of the ideals of society depicted in the preceding literature of Victorian England.\r\n\r\nGalsworthy was also a successful dramatist, his plays, written in a naturalistic style, usually examining some controversial ethical or social problem.  They include &quot;The Silver Box&quot; (1906), which, like many of his other works, has a legal theme and depicts a bitter contrast of the law's treatment of the rich and the poor; &quot;Strife&quot; (1909), a study of industrial relations; &quot;Justice&quot; (1910), a realistic portrayal of prison life that roused so much feeling that it led to reform; and &quot;Loyalties&quot; (1922), the best of his later plays.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are in ePUB or PDF format as indicated:\r\n\r\n* Complete Works of John Galsworthy (Delphi Classics, 2013) -- ePUB\r\n\r\n* Forsyte Saga, The [Books I-III] (HarperPerennial, 2014) -- ePUB\r\n\r\n* Forsyte Saga, The [Books I-III] (Oxford World's Classics, 1999).
