The classic synthesizer parts for modulation are LFOs and Envelopes. The â€˜human inputâ€™ is the keyboard we play and controllers like pitch bend or modulation wheel. A XY pad is perfect for the human input, but it controls only the filter and volume... We found this to be too limited. We wanted also to control the â€˜harmonicsâ€™ of the oscillator...changing the waveform using the XY pad.\r\n\r\nBLUE II v1.0.1\r\n\r\nFirst released in 2005 BLUE already reflected Rob Papenâ€™s cutting-edge, creative, and â€” most importantly â€” musical approach towards developing virtual instruments by first delivering FM and subtractive synthesis, then duly adding Phase Distortion and wave shaping synthesis into the highly creative mix to create one seriously creative combination. Rob Papen himself called it â€˜Cross-fusion synthesisâ€™ since it covered so much musical ground so effectively.\r\n\r\nPredator v1.6.5a\r\n\r\nPredator is a &quot;phat sounding&quot; killer synthesizer that combines inspiring presets and first-class features to make this your 'go-to' synth for contemporary music production.\r\nThe user interface has been designed so that almost all controls are visible on screen, making it fun and incredibly easy-to-use. And if you're unsure about a particular synth function, simply right click your mouse to access the help screen.\r\n\r\nRAW v1.0.2\r\n\r\nRAW has all the great Rob Papen filters to shape your sound further, but in a refreshing twist, 'EQ', â€˜Waveshaper', 'Distortion' and 'LoFi' have also been added on a voice synthesis level. Other FX such as Chorus, Phaser, Flanger, Stereo delay and the amazing HQ Reverb of Rob Papen can all be added to your sound and of course, the cool Arpeggiator/Sequencer, Easypage and preset bank manager have all been included as standard.\r\n\r\nRG v1.6.1\r\n\r\nBy using the RG onboard sequencer it is possible to create classic Rhythm Guitar grooves, but beyond that you can use the synthesizer features and effects to make fresh new edgy guitar grooves. To play the grooves RG is using a keyboard layout of &quot;major chords&quot; and &quot;minor chords&quot;, each with two sequence patterns (A or B) option.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDo not make money with this software...\r\n\r\nRemember to BUY the stuff if you USE it.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nfuture-dada\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\ndemonoid.pw\r\n1337x.to\r\nthepiratebay.se\r\nflashtorrents.org\r\nbtscene.cc\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMMXV (12)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d93cc538278c102dc90d60ae59a3562c411bdbd","amp;dn":"Rob+Papen+Plugins+Pack+12.2015+%5BHEXWARS%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d93cc538278c102dc90d60ae59a3562c411bdbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,147,204,83,130,120,193,2,220,144,214,10,229,154,53,98,196,17,189,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
