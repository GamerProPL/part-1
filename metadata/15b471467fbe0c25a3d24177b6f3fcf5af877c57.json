The trouble begins when a busload of American tourists arrive - along with some real ghosts. Among the tourists are married couple Jack and Sharon. Sharon's father holds the mortgage on Castle Plunkett, so she's hoping to debunk the ghosts. Jack, on the other hand, after meeting pretty ghost Mary, is very eager to believe. Can there be love between a human and ghost? Jack and Mary are going to try and find out. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15b471467fbe0c25a3d24177b6f3fcf5af877c57","amp;dn":"High+Spirits+%281988%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15b471467fbe0c25a3d24177b6f3fcf5af877c57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,180,113,70,127,190,12,37,163,210,65,119,182,243,252,245,175,135,124,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
