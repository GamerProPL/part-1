The original God of War saw Kratos, a mortal warrior, set upon an epic quest to dethrone a God. But his journey did not end there. In God of War II, Kratos sits atop his Olympus throne, as the new God of War Ã¢â‚¬â€œ far more ruthless than Ares ever was. To end his continued torment, Kratos must journey to the far reaches of the earth and defeat untold horrors and alter that which no mortal, or god has ever changed: his fate. God of War II sets an epic stage for a devastating mythological war to end all wars.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2d83b420276b60911dd63266e8a6861e43f315c","amp;dn":"God+of+War+II+%28PS2%29+%28NTSC%29+%28Fabio5ilva%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2d83b420276b60911dd63266e8a6861e43f315c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,216,59,66,2,118,182,9,17,221,99,38,110,138,104,97,228,63,49,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
