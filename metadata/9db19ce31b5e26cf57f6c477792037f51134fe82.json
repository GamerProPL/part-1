Based on \nthe latest multi-view 3D reconstruction technology, it operates with \narbitrary images and is efficient in both controlled and uncontrolled \nconditions. Photos can be taken from any position, providing that the \nobject to be reconstructed is visible on at least two photos. Both image \nalignment and 3D model reconstruction are fully automated.\n\nMain Features\nAerial and close-range triangulation\nPoint cloud generation (sparse / dense)\nPolygonal model generation (plain / textured)\nSetting coordinate system\nDigital Elevation Model (DEM) generation\nTrue orthophoto generaton\nGeoreferencing using flight log and / or GCPs\nMultispectral imagery processing\n4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes\nPython scripting support\n\n\nOS : Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 and 8 (32-bit / 64-bit)\nLanguage : Multilingual \n\nHome Page - http://agisoft.ru\n\nExample (download and view in latest acrobat reader: http://downloads.agisoft.ru/photoscan/sample04/sample04.pdf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9db19ce31b5e26cf57f6c477792037f51134fe82","amp;dn":"Agisoft+PhotoScan+Professional+1.0.4+Build+1847+%28x86+x64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9db19ce31b5e26cf57f6c477792037f51134fe82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,177,156,227,27,94,38,207,87,246,196,119,121,32,55,245,17,52,254,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
