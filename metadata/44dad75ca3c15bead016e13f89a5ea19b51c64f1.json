Going Home\n2. Amen\n3. Show Me The Place\n4. Darkness\n5. Anyhow\n6. Crazy to Love You\n7. Come Healing\n8. Banjo\n9. Lullaby\n10. Different Sides\n\n\nFrom our master singer-songwriter, Leonard Cohen, here are ten new songs that mine the heart, shake the body and break the boundaries as everybody knows only Leonard can do. A signature of our time, Leonard's baritone holds us like the voices of Hank, Frank and Ray. These are songs that nobody knows and everyone will treasure. The album was produced with Patrick Leonard, Anjani Thomas, Ed Sanders and Dino Soldo. Complementing Cohen's signature baritone on Old Ideas are the exceptional vocalists Dana Glover, Sharon Robinson, The Webb Sisters (Hattie and Charley Webb) and Jennifer Warnes. The album's cover design and drawings are Cohen's own. \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44dad75ca3c15bead016e13f89a5ea19b51c64f1","amp;dn":"Leonard+Cohen+-+Old+Ideas+%5Bmp3-320-2012%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44dad75ca3c15bead016e13f89a5ea19b51c64f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,218,215,92,163,193,91,234,208,22,225,63,137,165,234,25,181,28,100,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
