So much time saved. Make your best photos even better, with time to spare, thanks to a host of new features that deliver the precision your photos deserve.\n\nWorkflow\n\nSuper Fast Performance\n\nHigh resolution images require high amounts of handling power. Speed up your image processing and zoom through your workflow tasks, thanks to ACDSee Pro 6ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s native 64-bit support for Windows operating systems.\n\nHierarchical keywords\n\nSave time and stay on top of your growing collection by creating keyword hierarchies that span from the general to the very specific. For example, say youÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ve created this structure: Transportation | Cars | Vintage. When you assign an image of a Model-T to the Vintage keyword with a check of a box, it automatically gets added to the higher keyword levels. Click on a keyword in the Catalog pane or use Quick Search to display all of the files assigned to that keyword. Create as many levels as you need to fully and accurately classify your assets.\n\nImproved color management\n\nAchieve a consistent color workflow. Reworked from the ground up, ACDSee Pro 6's color management system resolves color matching issues that can occur between different devices with much more accurate color matching and higher quality results.
