Steelheart has the strength of ten men and can control the elements. It is said no bullet can harm him, no sword can split his skin, no explosion can burn him. He is invincible.\n\nIt has been ten years. We live our lives as best we can. Nobody fights back . . . nobody but the Reckoners. A shadowy group of ordinary humans who spend their lives studying powerful Epics, finding their weaknesses, then assassinating them.\n\nMy name is David Charleston. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not one of the Reckoners, but I intend to join them. I have something they need. Something precious, something incredible. Not an object, but an experience. I know his secret.\n\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen Steelheart bleed.\n\n\nTen years ago, Calamity came. It was a burst in the sky that gave ordinary men and women extraordinary powers. The awed public started calling them Epics.\n\nBut Epics are no friend of man. With incredible gifts came the desire to rule. And to rule man you must crush his wills. \n\nNobody fights the Epics... nobody but the Reckoners. A shadowy group of ordinary humans, they spend their lives studying Epics, finding their weaknesses, and then assassinating them.\n\nAnd David wants in. He wants SteelheartÃ¢â‚¬â€the Epic who is said to be invincible. The Epic who killed David's father. For years, like the Reckoners, David's been studying, and planningÃ¢â‚¬â€and he has something they need. Not an object, but an experience. \n\nHe's seen Steelheart bleed. And he wants revenge.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fae5bdc32a46abc8a625e4596ee55d6a4197ca8","amp;dn":"Brandon+Sanderson+-+Steelheart+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fae5bdc32a46abc8a625e4596ee55d6a4197ca8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,174,91,220,50,164,106,188,138,98,94,69,150,238,85,214,164,25,124,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
