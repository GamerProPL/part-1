Moving from lean, powerful R&amp;B to stylish, sophisticated soul to finally arrive at an intensely political and personal form of artistic self-expression, his work not only redefined soul music as a creative force but also expanded its impact as an agent for social change. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.89% CDDA &amp; 99.80% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nLabel:\t\t\tMotown\nCatalogue:\t\t440 014 368-2\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Stubborn Kind Of Fellow\n02.Hitch Hike\n03.Pride And Joy\n04.Can I Get A Witness\n05.You're A Wonderful One\n06.How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)\n07.I'll Be Doggone\n08.Ain't That Peculiar\n09.It Takes Two\n10.Ain't No Mountain High Enough\n11.Your Precious Love\n12.If I Could Build My Whole World Around You\n13.Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing\n14.You're All I Need To Get By\n15.You\n16.I Heard It Through The Grapevine\n17.Too Busy Thinking About My Baby\n18.That's The Way Love Is\n19.His Eye Is On The Sparrow (Stereo Mix)\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.What's Going On\n02.Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\n03.Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)\n04.You're The Man, Pts.
