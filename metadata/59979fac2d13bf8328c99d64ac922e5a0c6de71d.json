Ma even participates in a posthumous collaboration with one 1987 Piazzolla recording. Furthermore, while he's obviously the headliner here, he doesn't dominate the arrangements nearly as much as he does the billing and photography of the disc. While the result isn't your essential Piazzolla album (that would have to include more of the composer's own playing), it's an atmospheric and convincing collection, perhaps a good introduction for those who don't know the music. \n--Leslie Gerber","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59979fac2d13bf8328c99d64ac922e5a0c6de71d","amp;dn":"Yo-Yo+Ma+-+Soul+of+the+Tango%3A+The+Music+of+Astor+Piazzolla","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59979fac2d13bf8328c99d64ac922e5a0c6de71d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,151,159,172,45,19,191,131,40,201,157,100,172,146,46,90,12,109,231,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
