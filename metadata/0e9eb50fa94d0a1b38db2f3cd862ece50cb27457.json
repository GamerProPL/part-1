First, she romances Georgeson&amp;#039;s dimwitted but deadly henchman Kevin Kline (who won an Academy Award for his performance). Then, to clear the path for her getaway with Kline, Jamie woos Georgeson&amp;#039;s starched-shirt attorney, John Cleese ? and it&amp;#039;s Cleese whom she genuinely falls in love with. Michael Palin, Cleese&amp;#039;s former Monty Python cohort, plays a stuttering mob flunkey who continually messes up his one big assignment: killing a little old lady (it isn&amp;#039;t that he has any qualms about knocking off the old dear; it&amp;#039;s just that her pet dogs keep getting in the way). A Fish Called Wanda was scripted by star John Cleese.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095159/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095159/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirected by Charles Crichton \nProduced by Michael Shamberg \nWritten by John Cleese\nCharles Crichton \nStarring John Cleese\nJamie Lee Curtis\nKevin Kline\nMichael Palin \n\nRelease date(s) July 15, 1988 \nRunning time 108 min \nLanguage English\n\nLength.......................: 01h 43m 30s \n\nResolution...................: 624 x 352\nCodec........................: XviD, 2 Pass mode\nBitrate......................: Avg. 850 kBit/s\nFormat.......................: MP3\nChannels.....................: 2 Channels (Surround Stereo)\nSampleRate...................: 48000 Hz\nBitrate......................: 128 kBit/s\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e9eb50fa94d0a1b38db2f3cd862ece50cb27457","amp;dn":"A+Fish+Called+Wanda+%281988%29+%5BDVDrip+%28XviD%29%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e9eb50fa94d0a1b38db2f3cd862ece50cb27457","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,158,181,15,169,77,10,27,56,219,47,60,216,98,236,229,12,178,116,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
