His full given name is often listed as Declan Patrick Aloysius MacManus; however, Aloysius was not one of his names at birth, being added years later, around the time of the release of King of America (typically, it was a tongue-in-cheek gesture, Aloysius being one of the middle names of the character played by doomed English comic Tony Hancock in Hancock&amp;#039;s Half Hour), when he toyed with the idea of dropping his stage name Elvis Costello, in favor of performing under his real name Declan MacManus.\n\nCostello was an early participant in London&amp;#039;s pub rock scene in the mid-1970s, and later became associated with the punk rock and new wave musical genres, before establishing himself as a unique and original voice in the 1980s. His output has been wildly diverse: One critic has written that &quot;Costello, the pop encyclopedia, can reinvent the past in his own image&quot;.\n\nThe Very Best of Elvis Costello is a compilation album on two compact discs by Elvis Costello, sampling his recorded work from the years 1977 through 1998. First issued on Polygram Records on September 21, 1999, it was re-released less than two years later on Rhino Records.\n\nTrack listing\n\nDisc one\n&quot;(What&amp;#039;s So Funny &amp;#039;Bout) Peace Love and Understanding&quot; (Nick Lowe) (from single, 1978) ? 3:31 \n&quot;Oliver&amp;#039;s Army&quot; (from Armed Forces, 1979) ? 2:57 \n&quot;Watching the Detectives&quot; (from single, 1977) ? 3:43 \n&quot;Alison&quot; (from My Aim Is True, 1977) ? 3:21 \n&quot;(I Don&amp;#039;t Want to Go to) Chelsea&quot; (from single, 1978) ? 3:07 \n&quot;Accidents Will Happen&quot; (from Armed Forces, 1979) ? 3:01 \n&quot;Pump It Up&quot; (from This Year&amp;#039;s Model, 1978)? 3:13 \n&quot;I Can&amp;#039;t Stand Up for Falling Down&quot; (Homer Banks, Alan Jones) (from Get Happy!!, 1980)? 2:05 \n&quot;Radio Radio&quot; (from single, 1978) ? 3:06 \n&quot;Clubland&quot; (from Trust, 1980) ? 3:43 \n&quot;Good Year for the Roses&quot; (Jerry Chesnut) (from Almost Blue, 1981) ? 3:35 \n&quot;Man Out of Time&quot; (from Imperial Bedroom, 1982) ? 5:25 \n&quot;I Wanna Be Loved&quot; (Farnell Jenkins) (from Goodbye Cruel World, 1984) ? 4:46 \n&quot;Everyday I Write the Book&quot; (from Punch the Clock, 1983) ? 3:52 \n&quot;Brilliant Mistake&quot; (Declan MacManus) (from King of America, 1986) ? 3:41 \n&quot;The Other Side of Summer&quot; (MacManus) (from Mighty Like a Rose, 1991) ? 3:53 \n&quot;Tokyo Storm Warning&quot; (MacManus) (from Blood and Chocolate, 1986) ? 6:23 \n&quot;Sulky Girl&quot; (MacManus) (from Brutal Youth), 1986) ? 5:04 \n&quot;So Like Candy&quot; (MacManus, McCartney) (from Mighty Like a Rose, 1991) ? 4:35 \n&quot;Veronica&quot; (MacManus, McCartney) (from Spike, 1989) ? 3:07 \n&quot;She&quot; (Charles Aznavour, Herbert Kretzmer) (from Soundtrack to Notting Hill, 1999) ? 3:05 \n\nDisc two\n&quot;Big Tears&quot; (from This Year&amp;#039;s Model, 1978) ? 3:10 \n&quot;Beyond Belief&quot; (from Imperial Bedroom, 1982) ? 2:33 \n&quot;Lipstick Vogue&quot; (from This Year&amp;#039;s Model, 1978) ? 3:31 \n&quot;Green Shirt&quot; (from Armed Forces, 1978) ? 2:44 \n&quot;Pills and Soap&quot; (from Punch the Clock, 1983) ? 3:43 \n&quot;Tramp the Dirt Down&quot; (MacManus) (from Spike), 1989)? 5:41 \n&quot;Shipbuilding&quot; (Costello, Clive Langer) (from Punch the Clock, 1983)? 4:51 \n&quot;High Fidelity&quot; (from Get Happy!!, 1980) ? 2:28 \n&quot;New Lace Sleeves&quot; (from Trust, 1980) ? 3:47 \n&quot;(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes&quot; (from My Aim Is True, 1977) ? 2:46 \n&quot;Talking in the Dark&quot; (single, 1979) ? 1:57 \n&quot;New Amsterdam&quot; (from Get Happy!!, 1980) ? 2:13 \n&quot;I Hope You&amp;#039;re Happy Now&quot; (from Blood and Chocolate, 1986) ? 3:07 \n&quot;Riot Act&quot; (from Get Happy!!, 1980) ? 3:34 \n&quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; (Lorenz Hart, Richard Rodgers) ? 1:29 \n&quot;Indoor Fireworks&quot; (single, 1979) ? 4:09 \n&quot;Almost Blue&quot; (from Imperial Bedroom, 1982) ? 2:49 \n&quot;I Want You&quot; (from Blood and Chocolate, 1986) ? 6:43 \n&quot;God Give Me Strength&quot; (Burt Bacharach, Costello) (from Painted from Memory, 1998) ? 6:10 \n&quot;That Day Is Done&quot; (MacManus, McCartney) (previously unreleased) ? 5:10 \n&quot;I Want to Vanish&quot; (from All This Useless Beauty, 1996) ? 3:14 \n\nReleased April 17, 2001 \nRecorded 1977-1998 \nGenre Rock \nLength 154:07 \nLabel Rhino Records \nProducer(s) Elvis Costello, Burt Bacharach, T-Bone Burnett, Geoff Emerick, Larry Kalman Hirsch, Trevor Jones, Kevin Killen, Nick Lowe, Clive Langer, Billy Sherrill, Alan Winstanley\n\nEnjoy! and please seed..\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf9f1a42eadf9117105741bc72d9b24981a97f74","amp;dn":"Elvis+Costello+%28The+Very+Best+of%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf9f1a42eadf9117105741bc72d9b24981a97f74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,159,26,66,234,223,145,23,16,87,65,188,114,217,178,73,129,169,127,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
