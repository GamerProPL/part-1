'Aventine' is the follow up to her critically acclaimed debut album 'Philharmonics' (2010), which has sold 450,000 copies across Europe, achieving Platinum status in France and Belgium, five times Platinum in her native Denmark, where Agnes picked up five Danish Music Awards (the Danish Brits) in 2011.\n\nOriginally from Copenhagen, Agnes has lived in Berlin since 2006, where 'Aventine' was recorded at her Chalk Wood Studios between January and May this year. Like 'Philharmonics', the new album was written, arranged, and produced by Agnes, who provides piano and vocals. Anne M_ller, who has also played with Nils Frahm, adds cello, with Mika Posen of Timber Timbre playing the violin and viola on 'The Curse', 'Pass Them By' and 'Fivefold'. Robert Kondorossi of Budzillus plays guitar on 'Pass Them By'.\n\n&quot;While touring 'Philharmonics' I kept on getting all these ideas for recording, and I wanted to explore the cello and other string instruments&quot; says Agnes of 'Aventine'. &quot;I recorded everything quite closely, miking everything closely in a small room, with voices here, the piano here - everything is close to you. So it's sparse, but by varying the dynamic range of the songs I could create almost soundscapes. I was able to make something feel big with just these few instruments.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9309aa0c9469bf445e86a23bd262227b976d61f5","amp;dn":"Agnes+Obel+-+Aventine+%5B2013%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9309aa0c9469bf445e86a23bd262227b976d61f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,9,170,12,148,105,191,68,94,134,162,59,210,98,34,123,151,109,97,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
