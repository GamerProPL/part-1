Advertising executive Nick Beame (Tim Robbins) is not having a good day when he comes home from work to discover that his wife Ann (Kelly Preston) is having an affair with another man -- who, adding insult to injury, happens to be his boss, Phillip Barrow (Michael McKean). Deeply depressed, Nick hops into his SUV and starts driving aimlessly. He ends up in a rough neighborhood where a carjacker, T. Paul (Martin Lawrence), pulls a gun and jumps in the passenger seat. Nick grumbles &quot;Boy, did you pick the wrong guy on the wrong day,&quot; and, thinking he has no reason to live, heads out to the desert over T. Paul's objections. Nick learns that T. Paul is actually a family man who has turned to crime because he can't get a job. Nick offers to help T. Paul, though crime is not one of his strong suits, and things get even more complicated when a pair of crooks, Rig (John C. McGinley) and Charlie (Giancarlo Esposito), start following them.\n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 38 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 720\n\nFrame Height: 400\n\nFrame Rate: 23fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 159kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cb28633a54969cdcfdb0a9494159465353d7c29","amp;dn":"Nothing+to+Lose%281997%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cb28633a54969cdcfdb0a9494159465353d7c29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,178,134,51,165,73,105,205,207,219,10,148,148,21,148,101,53,61,124,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
