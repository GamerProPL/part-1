It seems fate has other plans, however, as a pirate captain named Ladoc catches up with him during a brief stopover in the port city of Ediz, and presents him with an offer he simply canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t refuse.\nLadoc, it happens, is the father of an old acquaintance from one of AdolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous adventures, and he wishes to solicit AdolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expertise in exploring the mysterious western islands of Canaan. There, a phenomenon similar to the Stormwall from AdolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first ever quest in Esteria is occurring, completely cutting off all trade and communication both in and out. The land is thus completely uncharted, and may hold treasures of heretofore unseen value.\nNever ones to back away from a good mystery, Adol and Dogi both agree to join Ladoc and his daughter, Terra, on this expedition aboard their ship, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tres Mares.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It seems the Romuns have their sights set on Canaan as well, however, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re none too keen on a ragtag group of pirates and adventurers getting in their way. When the Tres Mares is inevitably attacked at sea, Adol is knocked overboard and left for dead.\nHe washes ashore in Canaan itself, alive but weakened, rescued and resuscitated by two young girls named Isha and Olha who sport long ears and bushy tails. They are of the native Ã¢â‚¬Å“RehdaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tribe, and it seems Adol is not the first human to arrive hereÃ¢â‚¬â€nor are humans particularly welcome...\n\n\nAs a special bonus, Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim includes an optional download of the Ys VI Material Collection, a digital art collection featuring original illustrations and concept sketches from the development of the game.\nThe fast, real-time combat Ys is known for gets a new twist: three swords that control differently and house unique magical abilities which factor into all battle combos.\nSet to quintessentially Ys rock music composed by the legendary Falcom Sound Team jdk, giant monstrosities fill the screen and use clever tactics to try and end AdolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quest!\nAdjustable high-rez graphics, gamepad support, added warping among checkpoints, and a new Ã¢â‚¬Å“Catastrophe ModeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ where healing items canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be purchased or stored, combine for the best Ys VI yet.\n\n\nÃ¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/ys_vi_the_ark_of_napishtim&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/ys_vi_the_ark_of_napishtim&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb8e681cee9e95c73ab6f16539a354ba943b1851","amp;dn":"Ys+VI+The+Ark+of+Napishtim+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb8e681cee9e95c73ab6f16539a354ba943b1851","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,142,104,28,238,158,149,199,58,182,241,101,57,163,84,186,148,59,24,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
