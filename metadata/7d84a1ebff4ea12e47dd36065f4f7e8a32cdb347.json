The series is considered a &quot;modern-day retelling&quot; of the 1820 short story &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; by Washington Irving.\n\n\nIn 1781, Ichabod Crane, a soldier in the Colonial Army, on a mission for General George Washington, and caught up in a battle, beheads the Hessian soldier, the Headless Horseman, as the Horseman kills him. Now, in modern day Sleepy Hollow, New York, Ichabod rises from his grave, after the Headless Horseman (revealed to be Death, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, although the signs more appropriately point to Conquest, the First horseman of the Apocalypse, who rides a white horse while holding a bow) is summoned back from his watery grave by an unknown party. The resurrection of the one causes the resurrection of the other due to the intertwining of their fates as a result of their blood mixing shortly after Crane decapitated the Headless Horseman on the field of battle.\nLt. Abbie Mills begins investigating the Headless Horseman after he beheads Sheriff August Corbin, Mills' mentor and partner. Mills' investigation reveals the presence of two occult groups Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one for good, the other evil Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in Sleepy Hollow, both of which are concerned with the Four Horsemen and the associated apocalypse. The killing spree the Horseman embarks on causes Crane and Mills to team up.\nAs Crane's worldview is from 18th century Colonial America, some friction can be expected between him and Abbie, and also between him and the people he must now work with. This is often a source of comedy for the show, but also forces him to look at things differently and thus become a strength.\n\n\n\n\nStarring:\n----------\nTom Mison\nNicole Beharie\nOrlando Jones\nKatia Winter\n\n\n\n\nSpecs:\n----------\nFile Types: Mkv or Matroska Multimedia Container\nVideo Codec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC(part10)(avc1)\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: None \nResolution: 1280x720\nFrame Rate: 23.976215\nAudio Codec: A52 Audio  (aka AC3)(a52)\nChanels: 3F2R/LFE\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 384 kb/s\nSource: HDTV Rips\nAir Date: 2013\nTested with VLC on PC and WDTV Media Player on T.V.\n\n\n\n\n\nActual Screenshots:\n----------   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/40/h9is.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/40/h9is.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/836/itat.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/836/itat.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/703/bezw.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/703/bezw.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/163/bta1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/163/bta1.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/545/qwxd.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/545/qwxd.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/822/d7q9.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/822/d7q9.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nIMDb Link:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2647544/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2647544/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOfficial Website: \n \n\nWiki:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepy_Hollow_(TV_series)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepy_Hollow_(TV_series)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nMuch admiration to release groups and encoders such as BS, IMMERSE, EVOLVE, KILLERS, CtrlHD, DHD, 2HD, YesTV, MVGroup and KiNGS.\n\n\nBackups and other CARG releases can be found at ExtraTorrent, KickassTorrent and The Pirate Bay.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t\n\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d84a1ebff4ea12e47dd36065f4f7e8a32cdb347","amp;dn":"Sleepy+Hollow+Season+1+Complete+720p+HD+%5BCARG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d84a1ebff4ea12e47dd36065f4f7e8a32cdb347","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,132,161,235,255,78,161,46,71,221,54,6,95,79,126,138,50,205,179,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
