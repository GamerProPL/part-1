A best-seller for 35 years! This is a timeless classic that has taught generations of artists - and will teach generations more. When it was originally published in 1970, &quot;How to Draw What You See&quot; zoomed to the top of Watson-Guptill's best-seller list - and it has remained there ever since. &quot;I believe that you must be able to draw things as you see them - realistically,&quot; wrote Rudy de Reyna in his introduction. Today, generations of artists have learned to draw what they see, to truly capture the world around them, using de Reyna's methods. &quot;How to Draw What You See&quot; shows artists how to recognize the basic shape of an object - cube, cylinder, cone, or sphere - and use that shape to draw the object, no matter how much detail it contains.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8dae6850496d81cbf286f9a2f5005519d378143","amp;dn":"Drawing+the+Living+Figure+%2B+How+to+Draw+What+You+See+-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8dae6850496d81cbf286f9a2f5005519d378143","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,218,230,133,4,150,216,28,191,40,111,154,47,80,5,81,157,55,129,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
