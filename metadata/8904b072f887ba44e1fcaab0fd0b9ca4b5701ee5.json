Coyote (also known simply as 'The Coyote') and The Road Runner are a duo of\ncartoon characters from a series of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons.\nThe characters (a coyote and Greater Roadrunner) were created by animation director\nChuck Jones in 1948 for Warner Bros., while the template for their adventures was\nthe work of writer Michael Maltese. The characters star in a long-running series\nof theatrical cartoon shorts (the first 16 of which were written by Maltese)\nand occasional made-for-television cartoons.\nIn each episode, instead of animal senses and cunning, Wile E. Coyote uses absurdly\ncomplex contraptions (sometimes in the manner of Rube Goldberg) and elaborate plans\nto pursue his quarry. It was originally meant to parody chase cartoons like\nTom and Jerry, but it became popular, much to Jones' chagrin.\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE SEED!!!!!!\n\nMORE TO COME!!!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8904b072f887ba44e1fcaab0fd0b9ca4b5701ee5","amp;dn":"Wile+E.+Coyote+And+Road+Runner+Pack+%281949-2010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8904b072f887ba44e1fcaab0fd0b9ca4b5701ee5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,4,176,114,248,135,186,68,225,252,170,176,253,11,156,164,181,112,30,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
