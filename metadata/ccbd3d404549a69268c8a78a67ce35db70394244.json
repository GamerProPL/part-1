From the author of The Doors of Perception, Island, and countless other works of fiction, non-fiction, philosophy, and poetry, comes this powerful work of speculative fiction that has enthralled and terrified readers for generations. Brave New World remains absolutely relevant to this day as both a cautionary dystopian tale in the vein of the George Orwell classic 1984, and as thought-provoking, thoroughly satisfying entertainment","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccbd3d404549a69268c8a78a67ce35db70394244","amp;dn":"Aldous+Huxley+-+Brave+New+World+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccbd3d404549a69268c8a78a67ce35db70394244","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,189,61,64,69,73,166,146,104,200,167,138,103,206,53,219,112,57,66,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
