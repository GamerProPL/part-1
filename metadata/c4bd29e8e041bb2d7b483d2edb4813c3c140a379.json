He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2014, having previously won the Austrian State Prize for European Literature in 2012 and the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca from the Institut de France for his lifetime achievement in 2010. His other awards include the Prix Goncourt in 1978 for his novel Rue des boutiques obscures and the Grand prix du roman de l'AcadÃƒÂ©mie franÃƒÂ§aise in 1972 for Les Boulevards de ceinture.\n\nModiano's novels all delve into the puzzle of identity, of how one can track evidence of his existence through the traces of the past. Obsessed with the troubled and shameful period of the OccupationÃ¢â‚¬â€during which his father had allegedly engaged in some shady dealingsÃ¢â‚¬â€Modiano returns to this theme in all of his novels, book after book building a remarkably homogeneous work. &quot;After each novel, I have the impression that I have cleared it all away,&quot; he says. &quot;But I know I'll come back over and over again to tiny details, little things that are part of what I am. In the end, we are all determined by the place and the time in which we were born.&quot; He writes constantly about the city of Paris, describing the evolution of its streets, its habits and its people.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains following books, and all are in FRENCH language, and are in ePUB format:\n\n* Accident nocturne\n\n* Chien de printemps\n\n* Dans le cafe de la jeunesse perdue\n\n* De si braves garcons\n\n* Dimanches d'aout\n\n* Dora Bruder\n\n* Fleurs de ruine\n\n* La Petite Bijou\n\n* La Place de l'etoile\n\n* La Ronde De Nuit\n\n* Les boulevards de ceinture\n\n* L'herbe des nuits\n\n* L'horizon\n\n* Livret de famille\n\n* Quartier perdu\n\n* Rue des boutiques obscures\n\n* Un cirque passe\n\n* Un pedigree\n\n* Villa Triste\n\n* Voyage de noces\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Modiano&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Modiano&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.francetoday.com/articles/2011/11/15/patrick_modiano_literary_giant.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.francetoday.com/articles/2011/11/15/patrick_modiano_literary_giant.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/emma-brockes-column/2014/oct/09/patrick-modiano-nobel-prize-literature-prize-philip-roth-loser&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/emma-brockes-column/2014/oct/09/patrick-modiano-nobel-prize-literature-prize-philip-roth-loser&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/09/patrick-modiano-wins-nobel-prize-for-literature&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/09/patrick-modiano-wins-nobel-prize-for-literature&lt;/a&gt;\n\n===================================================================================\n\nFor 3 translated works in English see:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11181798/Patrick_Modiano_-_2014_Nobel_Prize_in_Literature_(3_books)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11181798/Patrick_Modiano_-_2014_Nobel_Prize_in_Literature_(3_books)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWe hope there will be more works available for English readers soon.
