Replacing the fiery Michael Bloomfield with the intense, weaving guitar of Robbie Robertson, Bob Dylan led a group comprised of his touring band the Hawks and session musicians through his richest set of songs. Blonde on Blonde is an album of enormous depth, providing endless lyrical and musical revelations on each play. Leavening the edginess of Highway 61 with a sense of the absurd, Blonde on Blonde is comprised entirely of songs driven by inventive, surreal, and witty wordplay, not only on the rockers but also on winding, moving ballads like &quot;Visions of Johanna,&quot; &quot;Just Like a Woman,&quot; and &quot;Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands.&quot; Throughout the record, the music matches the inventiveness of the songs, filled with cutting guitar riffs, liquid organ riffs, crisp pianos, and even woozy brass bands (&quot;Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35&quot;). It's the culmination of Dylan's electric rock &amp; roll period -- he would never release a studio record that rocked this hard, or had such bizarre imagery, ever again. \n\nBob Dylan - voce, chitarra, armonica, tastiere\nCharlie McCoy - harmonica\nHargus &quot;Pig&quot; Robbins - piano\nHenry Strzelecki\nKenneth Buttrey - drums\nJerry Kennedy\nWayne Moss\nBill Aitken\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img91.imageshack.us/img91/3253/blondierj6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img91.imageshack.us/img91/3253/blondierj6.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\n1.
