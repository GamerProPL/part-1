It is without a doubt a leader in its class, bringing the ability to emulate and record CDs and DVDs together into one amazingly easy-to-use software program. Now includes Alcohol Xtra. A unique Pre-Mastering function.\n\nWe have been constantly improving and developing Alcohol 120% since 2002 allowing our team of developers to maintain it's top position as a leading software company.\n\nImagine being able to store your most used CD and DVD images on your hard drive, and then run them at up to 200 times faster than some CD drives and without requiring the disc itself!\n\n\nHow about being able to make a backup of that CD or DVD onto another disk, either using the CD or DVD itself or just using the image you have created? This is what Alcohol allows you to do and much more..\n\n-Up to 31 virtual drives with a single click of a button.\n\n-Supports the latest Blu-Ray format and HD DVD (Single and Dual Layer)\n\n-Alcohol 120% can mount virtually any image files created, even from other software.\n\nAlcohol 120% enables you to make an exact 1:1 duplicate to re-cordable media of nearly all your expensive game and software titles, and an image that can be mounted and run from any one of Alcohol's virtual drives. \n\n-Alcohol 120% can make backup copies of your copy protected games, then you can run them up to 200 times faster than having them load from your cd drive.\n\n-Going on holiday and have no room for all those discs? Take all your CD's and DVD'S with you stored on your hard drive and mount them directly to your virtual drive.\n\n-Your laptop battery will last much longer, as you do not need your CD or DVD drive spinning as your hard drive consumes less power than an optical drive. \n\nWhat is new?\n\n2014-08-18 - 2.0.3.6732 FIX Please update to this version if you already downloaded 2.0.3.6731 (Major Bug Found when burning image files) \n\n2014-08-17 - 2.0.3.6731 \nNEW MDX, ISZ image file format for burning \nNEW Remove online help from installation package to save download time. download can be downloaded after help menu item selected if required. \n\nUPDATE More Drives supported\nUPDATE Firewall setting to add filter for public/private network for all versions after Vista\nUPDATE Add Sharing icon in main window. \nUPDATE Better manufacturer detection for BD-R/BD-RE media discs in DVD/CD Manager\nUPDATE More drives supported\n\nFIX MDS not listed as first supported image format\nFIX Problem with iSCSI Initiator bug\nFIX systemtray icon hidden after setting it to &quot;Always Show&quot; \nFIX Refresh button on Image Making Wizard and Copy Wizard \n\nSystem Requirements\n\nPlease ensure your computer system meets the following requirements otherwise Alcohol 120% may not work properly:\n\n-Intel/AMD based PC with Windows 2000/XP/Server 2003/08/R2/XP Professional x64 Edition/Server 2003/08/R2 x64/Vista/Windows 7/ 32x and 64x operating system.\n\n-32MB (or more) of RAM\n\n-10GB (or more) hard disk (a 74 minute CD image requires 650-700MB)\n\n-One or more bus-mastering SCSI and/or ATAPI buses\n\n-One or more CD-ROM/DVD-ROM drives.
