They are considered the Swiss army knife of text processing. Powerful search, replacement, extraction and validation of strings, repetitive and complex tasks are reduced to a simple pattern using regular expressions.\n\nMastering Python Regular Expressions will teach you about Regular Expressions, starting from the basics, irrespective of the language being used, and then it will show you how to use them in Python. You will learn the finer details of what Python supports and how to do it, and the differences between Python 2.x and Python 3.x.\n\nThe book starts with a general review of the theory behind the regular expressions to follow with an overview of the Python regex module implementation, and then moves on to advanced topics like grouping, looking around, and performance.\n\nYou will explore how to leverage Regular Expressions in Python, some advanced aspects of Regular Expressions and also how to measure and improve their performance. You will get a better understanding of the working of alternators and quantifiers. Also, you will comprehend the importance of grouping before finally moving on to performance optimization techniques like the RegexBuddy Tool and Backtracking.\n\nMastering Python Regular Expressions provides all the information essential for a better understanding of Regular Expressions in Python.\nApproach\n\nA short and straight to the point guide that explains the implementation of Regular Expressions in Python.\nWho this book is for\n\nThis book is aimed at Python developers who want to learn how to leverage Regular Expressions in Python. Basic knowledge of Python is required for a better understanding.\n\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c3a92d87cf9bafb0f95ef5a220928137e24f444","amp;dn":"Mastering+Python+Regular+Expressions+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c3a92d87cf9bafb0f95ef5a220928137e24f444","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,58,146,216,124,249,186,251,15,149,239,90,34,9,40,19,126,36,244,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
