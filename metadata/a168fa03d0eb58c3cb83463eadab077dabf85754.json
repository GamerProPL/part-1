It is laden with simple recipes, cooking techniques and daily exercises designed to get you in shape in no time. In the book, Ferruggia challenges popular dieting misconceptions, for instance on the importance of breakfast and of having six meals a day. He points out that the largest majority of Americans have breakfast, and yet over 50% of the country is made up of obese people. The book incorporates a healthy eating plan that defies the conventional rules of meal frequency that make people fat and lazy. He describes the Renegade Diet as a lifestyle change that will see you through many years of active living and fitness.\n\nThe eBook also incorporates some element of intermittent fasting, about 9 hours per day, on average. This is crucial as it ensures that insulin levels are kept at a minimum, and in doing so, the body remains in a state where it burns fat for much longer. Ferruggia recommends intermittent fasting as it creates a balance in how the body works. For example, fasting followed by light protein, vegetable and fat based meals serves to ensure improved productivity as energy levels peak. Fasting is also important as it enhances the release of growth hormones, and with the largest meal being consumed at dinner time, the body goes into an anabolic state and hence you grow muscle.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a168fa03d0eb58c3cb83463eadab077dabf85754","amp;dn":"Jason+Ferruggia+-+Renegade+Diet+-+Loosing+Fat+and+gaining+Muscle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a168fa03d0eb58c3cb83463eadab077dabf85754","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,104,250,3,208,235,88,195,203,131,70,62,173,171,7,125,171,248,87,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
