The band's line-up consists of vocalist Sonny Sandoval, drummer Wuv Bernardo, guitarist Marcos Curiel, and bassist Traa Daniels.\n\nThe band's name, P.O.D, derives itself from the banking term &quot;Payable on Death&quot;. The band chose this name to be a direct tie in to Christianity, which explains, that since Jesus died on the Cross, Christians inherit all of his assets (Heaven). P.O.D.'s style has evolved over the years, from the rap metal sound on their early albums to the nu metal and reggae-infused alternative metal styles for which they're most well known. Their latest album, When Angels &amp; Serpents Dance, is a combination of alternative rock, reggae rock and Latin-influenced metal with almost none of the rap metal or nu metal sound of their older releases. P.O.D.'s influences include Santana, Bad Brains, Bob Marley, Metallica, U2, Rage Against the Machine, Beastie Boys, Black Flag, Faith No More, Jane's Addiction, Living Colour, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sepultura and Suicidal Tendencies.\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - April 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c51100331e37ee7cd185976fdc1395880236b283","amp;dn":"P.O.D+Discography+1993-2012+%2817+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c51100331e37ee7cd185976fdc1395880236b283","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,17,0,51,30,55,238,124,209,133,151,111,220,19,149,136,2,54,178,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
