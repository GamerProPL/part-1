They formed in 1988 in Scarborough, Ontario, at the time a suburb of Toronto. They are best known for their hit singles, &quot;One Week&quot;, &quot;Pinch Me&quot;, &quot;If I Had $1000000&quot;, and &quot;Brian Wilson&quot;, and for their light-hearted, comedic performance style. The band&amp;#039;s trademark at live shows is humorous banter between songs, and improvised raps/songs, both of which are staples at virtually every concert.\n\nDisc One is the seventh full-length album by Barenaked Ladies. It is a &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation spanning BNL&amp;#039;s first decade, featuring a version of almost every single they had released to that point. The album also featured two new tracks: &quot;It&amp;#039;s Only Me (The Wizard of Magicland)&quot; and &quot;Thanks That Was Fun&quot;, which was released as a single. It was released in November of 2001 to a warm commercial reaction (yet another US gold record). The title itself is a tongue-in-cheek reference to a line from the song &quot;Box Set&quot; off the album Gordon.\n\nReleased November 13, 2001 \nRecorded 1991 - 2001 \nGenre Alternative Rock \nLength 73:23 \nLabel Reprise \nProducer(s) Barenaked Ladies, Scott Dibble, Michael Phillip Wojewoda, Don Was, et al\n\nTrack listing\n(Original studio album version unless otherwise noted)\n\n&quot;The Old Apartment&quot; (Steven Page, Ed Robertson) ? 3:22 (new edit of radio mix) \n&quot;Falling For The First Time&quot; (Page, Robertson) ? 3:39 \n&quot;Brian Wilson&quot; (Page) ? 4:44 (Rock Spectacle live album) \n&quot;One Week&quot; (Robertson) ? 2:48 \n&quot;Be My Yoko Ono&quot; (Page, Robertson) ? 2:44 \n&quot;Alternative Girlfriend&quot; (Stephen Duffy, Page) ? 4:20 \n&quot;It&amp;#039;s Only Me (The Wizard of Magicland)&quot; (Page, Robertson) ? 2:34 \n&quot;If I Had $1000000&quot; (Page, Robertson) ? 4:25 \n&quot;Call and Answer&quot; (Duffy, Page) ? 5:48 \n&quot;Get In Line&quot; (Jim Creeggan, Page, Robertson) ? 3:39 \n&quot;It&amp;#039;s All Been Done&quot; (Page) ? 3:26 \n&quot;Jane&quot; (Duffy, Page) ? 4:04 \n&quot;Lovers In A Dangerous Time&quot; (Bruce Cockburn) ? 4:05 \n&quot;Pinch Me&quot; (Page, Robertson) ? 4:37 (radio edit without fadeout ending) \n&quot;Shoe Box&quot; (Page, Robertson) ? 3:09 (radio remix) \n&quot;What A Good Boy&quot; (Page, Robertson) ? 4:50 (Rock Spectacle live album) \n&quot;Too Little Too Late&quot; (Page, Robertson) ? 3:23 \n&quot;Enid&quot; (Page, Robertson) ? 4:07 \n&quot;Thanks That Was Fun&quot; (Page, Robertson) ? 3:39 \n\nEnjoy! and please seed..\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3474707f6076a92f15dfa3a621685a4cce454d95","amp;dn":"Barenaked+Ladies+-+All+their+Greatest+Hits+1991-2001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3474707f6076a92f15dfa3a621685a4cce454d95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,116,112,127,96,118,169,47,21,223,163,166,33,104,90,76,206,69,77,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
