Imagine, too, that the letter contains his deepest, darkest secretÃ¢â‚¬â€something with the potential to destroy not just the life you built together, but the lives of others as well. Imagine, then, that you stumble across that letter while your husband is still very much alive. . . .\nCecilia Fitzpatrick has achieved it allÃ¢â‚¬â€sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an incredibly successful businesswoman, a pillar of her small community, and a devoted wife and mother. Her life is as orderly and spotless as her home. But that letter is about to change everything, and not just for her: Rachel and Tess barely know CeciliaÃ¢â‚¬â€or each otherÃ¢â‚¬â€but they too are about to feel the earth-shattering repercussions of her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secret.\n\nAcclaimed author Liane Moriarty has written a gripping, thought-provoking novel about how well it is really possible to know our spousesÃ¢â‚¬â€and, ultimately, ourselves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8a701132858ab45b4bee32530546c16ffeac9bd","amp;dn":"The+Husband%27s+Secret+-+Liane+Moriarty.mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8a701132858ab45b4bee32530546c16ffeac9bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,167,1,19,40,88,171,69,180,190,227,37,48,84,108,22,255,234,201,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
