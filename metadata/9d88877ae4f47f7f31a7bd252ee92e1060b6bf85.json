The band started as a studio-only project for the duo, as an outlet for the band's love of death metal. Increasing popularity lead them to add more band members for live performances, though outside of the band's founders, the lineup was constantly changing, revolving door of musicians throughout the 1990s, notably including Mikael Ã…kerfeldt of the band Opeth for a period.\r\n\r\nThis is not a Discography at least not a full one, this band has sooooo much material but this is a nice selection\r\n\r\n1993 - Dance Of December Souls (reissue 2006)\r\n1996 - Brave Murder Day (reissue 2004)\r\n1998 - Discouraged Ones\r\n1999 - Tonight's Decision\r\n2001 - Last Fair Deal Gone Down\r\n2003 - Viva Emptiness\r\n2006 - The Great Cold Distance\r\n2009 - Night Is The New Day\r\n2012 - Dead End Kings\r\n2013 - Dethroned &amp; Uncrowned\r\n\r\nBand members\r\n\r\nCurrent\r\n\r\n    Jonas Renkse â€“ vocals, guitar (1991â€“1994, 1996â€“present)\r\n    Anders NystrÃ¶m â€“ guitar, backing vocals (1991â€“1994, 1996â€“present)\r\n    Roger Ã–jersson â€“ guitar (2016â€“present)\r\n    Niklas Sandin â€“ bass (2009â€“present)\r\n    Daniel Moilanen â€“ drums (2015â€“present)\r\n\r\nFormer\r\n\r\n    Guillaume Le Huche â€“ bass (1992â€“1994)\r\n    Mikael Ã…kerfeldt â€“ vocals (1996â€“1999)\r\n    Fredrik Norrman â€“ guitar (1996â€“2009)\r\n    Mikael Oretoft â€“ bass (1997â€“1998)\r\n    Mattias Norrman â€“ bass (1999â€“2009)\r\n    Daniel Liljekvist â€“ drums, percussion (1999â€“2014)\r\n    Per Eriksson â€“ guitar (2009â€“2014)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d88877ae4f47f7f31a7bd252ee92e1060b6bf85","amp;dn":"Katatonia+-+Studio+Albums+1993-2013+ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d88877ae4f47f7f31a7bd252ee92e1060b6bf85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,136,135,122,228,244,127,127,49,167,189,37,46,233,46,16,96,182,191,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
