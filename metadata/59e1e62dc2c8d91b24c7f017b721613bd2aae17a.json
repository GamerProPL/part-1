The society inspired by the warrior world of the Old English poem Beowulf saw England become the world's first nation state and Europe's first country to conduct affairs in its own language, and Bede and Boniface of Wessex establish the dating convention we still use today. Including all the latest research, this is a fascinating assessment of a vital historical period.\r\n\r\nAbout the author: Geoffrey Hindley is an acclaimed Medievalist. His many books include The Shaping of Europe, Saladin: a Biography, The Book of Magna Carta, and A Brief History of the Crusades.\r\n\r\n&quot;This is an excellent assessment of a vital historical epoch from one of our most respected medievalists&quot; (Good Book Guide, July 1, 2006)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59e1e62dc2c8d91b24c7f017b721613bd2aae17a","amp;dn":"A+Brief+History+of+the+Anglo-Saxons_+Brief+Histories","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59e1e62dc2c8d91b24c7f017b721613bd2aae17a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,225,230,45,194,200,217,27,36,199,240,23,183,33,97,59,210,170,225,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
