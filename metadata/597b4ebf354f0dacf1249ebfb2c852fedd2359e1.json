It follows the story of two African-American high school students in Chicago and their dream of becoming professional basketball players.\n\nOriginally intended to be a 30-minute short produced for the Public Broadcasting Service, it eventually led to five years of filming and 250 hours of footage. It premiered at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival where it won the Audience Award for Best Documentary. Despite its length (171 minutes) and unlikely commercial genre, it received high critical and popular acclaim. It was on more critics' top ten lists than any other film that year, including Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption, and Forrest Gump.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110057/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110057/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:597b4ebf354f0dacf1249ebfb2c852fedd2359e1","amp;dn":"Hoop.Dreams.1994.Criterion.Collection.DVDRip.480p.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"597b4ebf354f0dacf1249ebfb2c852fedd2359e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,123,78,191,53,79,13,172,241,36,158,191,178,200,82,254,221,35,89,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
