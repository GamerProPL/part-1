From German Wolf Pack attacks on Russian convoy traffic and military vessels to close-quarter combat undertaken by small U-boats transported by land and river to the Black Sea, the Kriegsmarine wrestled for control of the seas fringing an embattled Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nCombined with the fortitude of U-boat crews who fought in some of the harshest weather conditions found at sea, ingenuity on behalf of German military engineers also facilitated the transfer of U-boats from Germany to Romania. From there, the Kriegsmarine engaged Soviet military might and pioneered the use of submarine-based rocket firing technology against land targets. The struggle between the Kriegsmarineâ€™s U-boats and the Red Navy lasted from the opening salvos of Operation Barbarossa to the final chaotic days of Germanyâ€™s defeat.\r\n\r\nAvailable in English for the first time, Steel and Ice is well-illustrated, containing never-before-published color and black and white photos","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca8118753a1092930fe716096e21b7c2268bb647","amp;dn":"Steel+and+Ice%3A+The+U-Boat+Battle+in+the+Arctic+and+Black+Sea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca8118753a1092930fe716096e21b7c2268bb647","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,129,24,117,58,16,146,147,15,231,22,9,110,33,183,194,38,139,182,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
