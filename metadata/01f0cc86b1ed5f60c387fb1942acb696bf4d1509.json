Interestingly, Leiber says in the liner notes that his primary songwriting inspiration was radio plays.\nFor example, the sound effects on &quot;Riot in Cell Block #9&quot; were inspired by GANGBUSTERS, a popular crime series of the early &amp;#039;50s. This music is some of the \nbest first-generation rock &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; roll, with each comedic track brilliantly sung. Anybody who thought early rock was illiterate and a-musical obviously never listened to these songs.\n\n\n\n01.
