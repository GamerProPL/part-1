He releases reports about sexual behavior of American people in 1948 and 1953. He interviews 18,000 people to take sex histories. It is sensational and controversial because it is taboo to talk about sex. And people have little knowledge of it. No knowledge makes them worry and feel guilty. Actually, he and his wife lose their virginity after their marriage, but it is unsuccessful. From the bad experience, and as he consults with his students to give them advice about sexual problems, he gets interested in revealing people&amp;#039;s sexual behavior. He devotes his life to sex research. His academic curiosity is amazing. He supports &quot;diversity&quot; and &quot;individualism&quot;. He claims there are common and rare sexual behaviors, but we shouldn&amp;#039;t categorize it into the two groups, normal and abnormal. He influences a lot of people. Especially, he encourages and saves homosexual people. In short, Kinsey is an influential figure who is fascinated with sex research and contributes to the society.\n\nCAST\n\nAlfred Kinsey(Liam Neeson)\nClara McMillen(Laura Linney)\nWardell Pomeroy(Chris O&amp;#039;Donnell)\nClyde Martin(Peter Sarsgaard)\nPaul Gebhard (Timothy Hutton)\nAlfred Seguine Kinsey (John Lithgow)\nThurman Rice(Tim Curry)\nHerman Wells (Oliver Platt)\nAlan Gregg (Dylan Baker)\nAlice Martin (Julianne Nicholson)\nKenneth Braun (William Sadler)\nHuntington Hartford (John McMartin)\nSara Kinsey (Veronica Cartwright)\nBarbara Merkle (Kathleen Chalfant)\nMartha Pomeroy (Heather Goldenhersh)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1e65c8e7e068a0afc8dcffbe05f69165088b5b4","amp;dn":"Kinsey.2004.DVDRip.XviD.AR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1e65c8e7e068a0afc8dcffbe05f69165088b5b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,230,92,142,126,6,138,10,252,141,207,251,224,95,105,22,80,136,181,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
