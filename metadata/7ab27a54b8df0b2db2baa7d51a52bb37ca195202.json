He leaves for boarding school to seek what the dying poet Francois Rabelais called the &quot;Great Perhaps.&quot; Much awaits Miles at Culver Creek, including Alaska Young. Clever, funny, screwed-up, and dead sexy, Alaska will pull Miles into her labyrinth and catapult him into the Great Perhaps.\n\nLooking for Alaska brilliantly chronicles the indelible impact one life can have on another. A stunning debut, it marks John Green's arrival as an important new voice in contemporary fiction.\n\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n                               \n\n           **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n             Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                 &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ab27a54b8df0b2db2baa7d51a52bb37ca195202","amp;dn":"Looking+For+Alaska+by+John+Green+%5BRequest%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ab27a54b8df0b2db2baa7d51a52bb37ca195202","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,178,122,84,184,223,11,45,178,186,167,213,26,82,187,55,202,25,82,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
