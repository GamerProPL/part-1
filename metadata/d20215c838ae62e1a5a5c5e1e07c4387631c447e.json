Compilation producer Zach Braff was awarded a Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for a Motion Picture for his work on the album.\n\nThe music in the film features a number of indie-rock artists, notably The Shins. In an early scene, Sam passes Andrew a headset which is playing the song &quot;New Slang&quot; by The Shins as she says &quot;You gotta hear this one song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll change your life; I swear.&quot; A second Shins song, &quot;Caring Is Creepy&quot;, is also featured on the soundtrack. The presence of Simon &amp; Garfunkel's &quot;The Only Living Boy in New York&quot; on the soundtrack has been cited by some as evidence of another connection to The Graduate. Commenting on the soundtrackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s importance to the film, Sponic Zine wrote, &quot;Braff did a masterful job of choosing songs that exemplified the emotional subtleties in the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ he put together a group of songs that complement each other perfectly and, when put together into one album, create something amazing, almost as if they never should have been apart.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d20215c838ae62e1a5a5c5e1e07c4387631c447e","amp;dn":"Garden+State+%28Music+from+the+Motion+Picture%29+-+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d20215c838ae62e1a5a5c5e1e07c4387631c447e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,2,21,200,56,174,98,225,165,165,197,225,224,124,67,135,99,28,68,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
