So here, every track tagged by hand with the artists included. All files came directly from the game folder so feel free to just copy and paste from there but you will just have 48 unlabeled tracks.\n\nEnjoy,\nzvxxczz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ab9f8c9e4cff47f773d16cbc05cc68dcea5a45e","amp;dn":"Fallout%3A+New+Vegas+-+2010+-+OST+%5BMP3+256%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ab9f8c9e4cff47f773d16cbc05cc68dcea5a45e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,185,248,201,228,207,244,127,119,61,22,203,192,92,198,141,206,165,164,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
