Disc in 1992. It was a Top 10 album in the U.K. and marked a return to his first love, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s Soul and R&amp;B. The follow up, Wild Wood, launched him on a run of critical and commercial success: The album went to No. 2 in the U.K. and was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize; its multi platinum, million seller successor, Stanley Road (featuring guest appearances by Steve Winwood and Noel Gallagher), spawned two U.K. Top 10 singles (Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Changing Man,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ No. 7, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Do Something to Me,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ No. 9), went to No. 1 and he picked up BRIT Award for Best Male Artist (which he won again the following year). 1997Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Heavy Soul saw Weller twist his sound again to take him back to the top of the charts (No. 2 in the U.K.) and 2000s Heliocentric (erroneously rumoured to be his last album at the time), which was a much lighter affair, did the same and peaked again at No. 2 in the U.K.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[/center]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba60bc5aab82295ade5911366910a65e5c73efd7","amp;dn":"Paul+Weller+-+Classic+Album+Selection+Vol+1+%282014%29+MP3%40320kbps+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba60bc5aab82295ade5911366910a65e5c73efd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,96,188,90,171,130,41,90,222,89,17,54,105,16,166,94,92,115,239,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
