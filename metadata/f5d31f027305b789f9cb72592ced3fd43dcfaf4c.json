His extant works, including some collaborations, consist of about 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, the authorship of some of which is uncertain.  His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.\n\nThere are a flood of public domain editions of Shakespeare available but almost no modern critical, annotated editions.  This collection focuses almost exclusively on the latter.  Hopefully these will make reading the Bard a more inviting and rewarding experience.\n\n\nThe books in this collection are listed by (1) series, and (2) title; many plays appear in multiple editions.
