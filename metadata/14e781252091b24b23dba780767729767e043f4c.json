Hence the book attempts to explain, mainly by geographical factors, why Europeans had such superior military technology and why diseases to which Europeans were immune devastated conquered populations.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns,_germs_and_steel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns,_germs_and_steel&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nI do not have unlimited upload speed, so you need to be a bit patient.
