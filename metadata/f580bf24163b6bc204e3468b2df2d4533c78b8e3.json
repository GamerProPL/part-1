The virtual-analog concept belies the contemporary, cutting-edge sound it generates. Clearly laid out and easy to use, MASSIVE gives you earth-shuddering sounds from the very first note.\n\nUNCOMPROMISING SOUND\n\nMASSIVE gives your tracks a solid foundation with the creamiest, punchiest basses. Razor-sharp leads cut through the mix even with grit and dirt piled high. And an overwhelming array of wavetable oscillators, modulation options, and filters and effects offer a sonic spectrum as broad as it is inspiring.\n\nCENTER STAGE\n\nMASSIVE is ideal for live performance. The integrated step sequencers, effects, and a highly flexible modulation concept deliver incredible versatility. All these features have been implemented with a focus on usability so MASSIVE is just as easy to use on a hectic stage as it is in the studio.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo not make money with this software...\n\nRemember to BUY the stuff if you USE it.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndemonoid.pw\n1337x.to\nthepiratebay.se\nflashtorrents.org\nbtscene.cc\ncastradio.net\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXV (07)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f580bf24163b6bc204e3468b2df2d4533c78b8e3","amp;dn":"Native+Instruments+-+Massive+v1.5.0+UPDATE+OS+X+%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f580bf24163b6bc204e3468b2df2d4533c78b8e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,128,191,36,22,59,107,194,4,227,70,139,45,242,212,83,60,120,184,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
