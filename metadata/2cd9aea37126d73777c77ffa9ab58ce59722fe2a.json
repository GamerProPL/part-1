Doran [epub]\r\n\r\nMarcus Samuel, Jr., is an unorthodox Jewish merchant trader. Henri Deterding is a take-no-prisoners oilman. In 1889, John D. Rockefeller is at the peak of his power. Having annihilated all competition and possessing near-total domination of the market, even the U.S. government is wary of challenging the great â€œanacondaâ€ of Standard Oil. The Standard never losesâ€”that is until Samuel and Deterding team up to form Royal Dutch Shell. \r\n \r\nA riveting account of ambition, oil, and greed, Breaking Rockefeller traces Samuelâ€™s rise from outsider to the heights of the British aristocracy, Deterdingâ€™s conquest of America, and the collapse of Rockefellerâ€™s monopoly. The beginning of the twentieth century is a time when vast fortunes were made and lost. Taking readers through the rough and tumble of East Londonâ€™s streets, the twilight turmoil of czarist Russia, to the halls of the British Parliament, and right down Broadway in New York City, Peter Doran offers a richly detailed, fresh perspective on how Samuel and Deterding beat the worldâ€™s richest man at his own game","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cd9aea37126d73777c77ffa9ab58ce59722fe2a","amp;dn":"Breaking+Rockefeller%3A+The+Rivals+Who+Toppled+an+Oil+Empire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cd9aea37126d73777c77ffa9ab58ce59722fe2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,217,174,163,113,38,215,55,119,199,127,250,154,181,140,229,151,34,254,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
