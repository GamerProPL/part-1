However, object-orientation itself is not a language; it's simply a set of ideas and concepts.\n\nLet Simon Allardice introduce you to the termsÃ¢â‚¬â€words like abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, subclassÃ¢â‚¬â€and guide you through defining your requirements and identifying use cases for your program. The course also covers creating conceptual models of your program with design patterns, class and sequence diagrams, and unified modeling language (UML) tools, and then shows how to convert the diagrams into code.\nTopics include:\n\n    Why use object-oriented design (OOD)?\n    Pinpointing use cases, actors, and scenarios\n    Identifying class responsibilities and relationships\n    Creating class diagrams\n    Using abstract classes\n    Working with inheritance\n    Creating advanced UML diagrams\n    Understanding object-oriented design principles\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lynda.com/Programming-tutorials/Foundations-of-Programming-Object-Oriented-Design/96949-2.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lynda.com/Programming-tutorials/Foundations-of-Programming-Object-Oriented-Design/96949-2.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbf7c6a6dd9a0fe6a2de9726bd26ad2e0847cec2","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+Foundations+of+Programming%3A+Object-Oriented+Design","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbf7c6a6dd9a0fe6a2de9726bd26ad2e0847cec2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,247,198,166,221,154,15,230,162,222,151,38,189,38,173,46,8,71,206,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
