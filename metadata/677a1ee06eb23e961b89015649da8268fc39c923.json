In 1984, his first novel, The Hunt for Red October, was published and he was catapulted onto the bestseller list, he received praise from Former U S President Reagan, saying his book was &quot;non-put-downable.&quot; and it was later famously made into a film starring Sean Connery. Since then Clancy, has established himself as a master at building heightened realist scenarios by 'turning up the volume' on current events.\n\nThe success of Clancy's books has resulted in his 'adoption' by the military. He is regularly welcomed aboard jets, submarines, and destroyers. Admirals and generals give him access, Pentagon officials debrief him, and many of his books are required reading at military colleges.\n\nSince the phenomenal worldwide success of 'The Hunt for Red October', Tom Clancy has become one of the world's fastest-selling thriller writers, with a string of international bestsellers to his name. Three of his novels have been made into highly successful films: 'The Hunt for Red October', 'Patriot Games' and 'Clear and Present Danger'. He is also the author of the non-fiction books 'Submarine, 'Armoured Warfare', 'Fighter Wing' and 'Marine', and the co-creator of the Op-Centre series. He lives in Maryland, USA.\n\nJack Ryan:\n1.
