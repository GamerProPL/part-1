Gondo is contacted by a gang of kidnappers, who inform him that they've kidnapped his son. The crooks demand a huge ransom for the boy's return -- an amount so huge that it will utterly bankrupt Gondo. As the harried businessman prepares to pay the ransom, he discovers that his son is safe at home: the kidnappers have accidentally snatched the son of his chauffeur. Does Gondo drop his payoff plans, or does he do the honorable thing and rescue his employee's son? This dilemma is but one aspect of the multilayered character study from the unbeatable team of star Toshiro Mifune and filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, who directs this superb film with his usual depth and impeccable eye for detail and character. As a man forced to make impossible decisions, Mifune gives a nuanced, perceptive and psychologically convincing performance. While not one of Kurosawa's master works, High and Low, with its grim reality and moral ambiguity stands as a superb example of film noir at its best. High and Low was originally released in Japan as Tengoku To-Jigoku.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Tengoku to jigoku.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 2,197,661,696 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:23:41\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 672x288 (AR: 2.333)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1390 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.300 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 448 kb/s [4 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 2\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057565/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057565/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Japanese\nSubtitles: English, French, Spanish and Portuguese (srt)\n\nRip of the Criterion DVD, posted originally at KG by mike65, whom we thank\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4cd286dcc33f1ce91901b3c8e31d930a2b66751","amp;dn":"Akira+Kurosawa+-+Tengoku+to+jigoku+%5BHigh+and+Low%5D+%281963%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4cd286dcc33f1ce91901b3c8e31d930a2b66751","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,205,40,109,204,51,241,206,145,144,27,60,142,49,217,48,162,182,103,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
