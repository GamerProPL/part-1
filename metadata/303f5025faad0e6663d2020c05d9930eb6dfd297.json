The authors, all world-class researchers and teachers, incorporate medically relevant examples where appropriate to help illustrate the connections between cell biology and health and human disease. As always, a hallmark of MCB is the use of experiments to engage students in the history of cell biology and the research that has contributed to the field.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:303f5025faad0e6663d2020c05d9930eb6dfd297","amp;dn":"Lodish+-+Molecular+Cell+Biology+-+7th+edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"303f5025faad0e6663d2020c05d9930eb6dfd297","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,63,80,37,250,173,14,102,99,210,2,12,5,217,147,14,182,223,210,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
