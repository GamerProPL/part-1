From his stylin&amp;#039; threads through his provocative, tell-it-like-it-is monologue, Williams aims to provoke with this one-man show. Rapper Snoop Dogg, seen giving Williams a pre-show pep talk while indulging in a blunt, invokes the names of Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor as influences and inspirations for Williams&amp;#039; comedy. Just as Pryor used both the &quot;N&quot; word and a certain 12-letter obscenity until they sounded like urban poetry, so does Williams, even as he scores points about everything from black-white relations to his anger at the way black people excuse the behavior of both Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston. The man&amp;#039;s got something to say - and a funny way of saying it. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81d15b4b13f1f7ceaba8c6e9112fa5b77ee9f80b","amp;dn":"Katt+Williams+-+The+Pimp+Chronicles+Part+1+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81d15b4b13f1f7ceaba8c6e9112fa5b77ee9f80b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,209,91,75,19,241,247,206,171,168,198,233,17,47,165,183,126,233,248,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
