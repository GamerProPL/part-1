Elin Almered and Johan Duncanson formed a  |\n|  prototypical version of the group in Lund, Sweden, in 1995 while they     |\n|  were in high school, naming the group after a gas station called          |\n|  Radioavdelningen. Almered and Duncanson disbanded almost as soon as       |\n|  they'd found a name, but Duncanson revived the group three years later,   |\n|  teaming up with Martin Larsson. Bassist Lisa Carlberg, drummer Per        |\n|  Blomgren, and keyboardist Daniel Tjader rounded out the lineup in 2001,   |\n|  and things took off for the group at that point. They sent a demo to      |\n|  Sonic magazine, which went on to feature the band on a CD sampler.        |\n|  Swedish indie giant Labrador caught wind of the demo via the sampler and  |\n|  snapped the band up; the group's debut full-length, Lesser Matters,       |\n|  arrived two years later, during which time Blomgren amicably split with   |\n|  the group. That album and the band's second release on Labrador, 2005's   |\n|  Pulling Our Weight EP, received widespread attention with the release of  |\n|  Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, which featured &quot;Keen on Boys,&quot;          |\n|  &quot;Pulling Our Weight,&quot; and &quot;I Don't Like It Like This.&quot;                    |\n|                                                                            |\n|  Carlberg left the group soon after Pulling Our Weight was released, and   |\n|  the group refrained from hiring another bassist, opting instead for the   |\n|  use of a drum machine on its next album. That release, 2006's Pet Grief,  |\n|  found Duncanson and Larsson turning away from the guitar-driven aspects   |\n|  of their first full-length and delving into synth pop in the spirit of    |\n|  the Pet Shop Boys. Due to various factors, including the fact that the    |\n|  band didn't tour heavily in support of the album, Pet Grief failed to     |\n|  sell as well as its predecessor and received little attention from the    |\n|  mainstream music press. The Radio Dept. took their time recording         |\n|  material for their next album, and it wasn't until summer of 2008 that a  |\n|  new single, Freddie and the Trojan Horse, was released. More delays led   |\n|  to nothing further surfacing (and the album that was supposed to be out   |\n|  in late 2008, Clinging to a Scheme, being shelved) until the next         |\n|  summer, when the single David was released.                               |\n|                                                                            |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfa6602cadfbafaafb2d2918d797b26caa7d3e7e","amp;dn":"The+Radio+Dept+-+Clinging+To+A+Scheme+%5B2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfa6602cadfbafaafb2d2918d797b26caa7d3e7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,166,96,44,173,251,175,170,251,45,41,24,215,151,178,108,170,125,62,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
