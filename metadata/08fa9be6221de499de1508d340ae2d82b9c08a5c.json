Actually itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about management. You build your own enterprise producing several types of drugs, find the right place to sell them, invite scientists and security, avoid federal agents and build the most effective company.\n\nYou start in your own basement. Since the police has no interest in a small dealer, you have the chance to grow. Once your expansion becomes noticeable youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be allowed to sell at higher rates, get better workers, upgrade your production and access new technologies. But be careful! This growth will attract the cops. With rapid growth, your enterprise will become fragile. If it survives all the troubles it faces, you will become invincible. Otherwise, you will lose money, workers and respect. While your influence in the city shortens, you risk being imprisoned in the end","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08fa9be6221de499de1508d340ae2d82b9c08a5c","amp;dn":"Basement+v0.2.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08fa9be6221de499de1508d340ae2d82b9c08a5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,250,155,230,34,29,228,153,222,21,8,211,64,174,45,130,185,192,138,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
