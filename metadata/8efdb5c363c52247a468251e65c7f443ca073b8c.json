No need to be worried - I said to myself... it will be easy to be found online.\nIt wasn't... I had to struggle on some obscure cyberlocker to have it.\nI've always taken for granted that the best rock band in activity was widely available in torrents.\nBut, apart a good torrent with their studio albums, there was no extensive discography...\n\nSo now you have it...\nIt includes their new 2013 eponimous album leaked a week before the official release date (and at first listening I can say it's really good :) ). \n\nWe start since the Majesty epoch until today, including bootlegs, live, and demos and all the singles I was able to recover.\n\nThere are 60 albums and 10 singles and this should be satisfying even for the captive fans.\n\nAll the album are zipped (since the number of files was too high for TPB).\n\nThe sampling rate is 320kbps.\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n\n\n(browse all my torrents:\n        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\nfor private posts:\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&lt;/a&gt;\n\n)\n\n\nAlbums List:\n\n00 Majesty (pre Dream Theater)\n\t1986 - No Sleep Since Brooklyn - Instru Mental III\n\t1987 - Instru Mental\n\t1992 - Instru Mental II\n\t1995 - When Dream and Today Unite\n\n\n01 Studio Albums\n\t1989 - When Dream And Day Unite\n\t1992 - Images and Words\n\t1994 - Awake\n\t1997 - Falling Into Infinity\n\t1999 - Metropolis Pt.2 Scenes From A Memory\n\t2002 - Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\n\t2003 - Train of Thought\n\t2005 - Octavarium\n\t2007 - Systematic Chaos\n\t2009 - Black Clouds and Silver Linings\n\t2011 - A Dramatic Turn of Events\n\t2013 - Dream Theater\n\n        \n02 EP\n\t1995 - A Change of Seasons\n\t2009 - Wither\n\n\n03 Compilation Albums\n\t2008 - Dream Theater's Greatest Hit (... &amp; 21 Other Pretty Cool Songs)\n\n\n04 Live Albums\n\t1993 - Live At The Marquee\n\t1998 - Once in a LIVEtime\n\t2001 - Live Scenes From New York\n\t2004 - Live at Budokan\n\t2006 - Score - 20th Anniversary World Tour\n\t2008 - Chaos in Motion 2007-2008\n\n\n05 Singles\n\t1992 - Another Day\n\t1994 - Lie\n\t1994 - The Silent Man\n\t1996 - Hollow Years\n\t2000 - Through Her Eyes\n\t2003 - As I Am\n\t2007 - Constant Motion\n\t2009 - A Rite of Passage\n\t2009 - Take your Fingers from my Hair\n\t2013 - The Enemy Inside\n\n\n06 Official Bootlegs - Cover Series\n\t2002 - Master of Puppets (Metallica)\n\t2005 - The Number of the Beast (Iron Maiden)\n\t2006 - The Dark Side of the Moon (Pink Floyd)\n\t2007 - Made in Japan (Deep Purple)\n\t2009 - Uncovered 2003 - 2005\n        \n\n07 Official Bootlegs - Demo Series\n\t2003 - Majesty Demos 1985-1986\n\t2004 - When Dream and Day Unite Demos 1987-1989\n\t2005 - Images and Words Demos 1989-1991\n\t2006 - Awake Demos 1994\n\t2007 - Falling into Infinity Demos 1996-1997\n\t2009 - Train of Thought Instrumental Demos 2003\n        \n\n08 Official Bootlegs - Studio Series\n\t2003 - The Making of Scenes from a Memory\n\t2009 - The Making of Falling into Infinity\n        \n\n09 Official Bootlegs - Live Series\n\t2003 - Los Angeles, California 5-18-98\n\t2004 - Tokyo, Japan 10-28-95\n\t2005 - When Dream and Day Reunite\n\t2006 - New York City 3-4-93\n\t2006 - Old Bridge, New Jersey 12-14-96\n        \n\n10 Other Albums\n\t1996 - Christmas CD\n\t1996 - Uncovered\n\t1997 - Guitar Talkin'\n\t1998 - Once in a Livetime Outtakes\n\t1998 - Trial of Singles\n\t1999 - Cleaning out the Closet\n\t2000 - Scenes from a World Tour\n\t2001 - Four Degrees of Radio Edits\n\t2002 - Taste the Memories\n\t2002 - The ATCO Demos\n\t2003 - Graspop Festival 2002\n\t2003 - Stream of Consciousness\n\t2004 - A Sort of Homecoming\n\t2004 - The Covers 2\n\t2007 - Images and Words 15th Anniversary Performance\n\t2007 - Lifting Shadow (companion cd)\n\t2008 - Progressive Nation 2008\n\n\n(browse all my torrents:\n        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\nfor private posts:\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&lt;/a&gt;\n\n)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8efdb5c363c52247a468251e65c7f443ca073b8c","amp;dn":"Dream+Theater+Discography+1986+-+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8efdb5c363c52247a468251e65c7f443ca073b8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,253,181,195,99,197,34,71,164,104,37,30,101,199,244,67,202,7,59,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
