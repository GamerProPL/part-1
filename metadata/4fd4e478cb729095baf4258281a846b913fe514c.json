With Exposure, your photo will look like it was made by a human, not a computer. \n\nExposure helps you visually explore carefully designed looks, reducing the need to fiddle with techy controls. The redesigned user interface in Exposure 5 reduces distraction and provides new ways to quickly find your style. There is a much wider range of textures and new controls to subtly combine them. Exposure works everywhere you do, now with Aperture support and as a stand-alone application that provides easy batch processing.\n\nAll the Creative Tools of the Film World \n\nWe explored the entire history of analog photography to bring back diverse tools, from discontinued films to dark room tricks, covering both color and black &amp; white. These techniques give you new ways to think about your art, express yourself, and stand out from people using typical digital tools. \n\nExposureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s presets give you hundreds of starting points for developing complex styles. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find nostalgic favorites like Kodachrome and Polaroid, plus obscure ones like Panatomic-X. \n\nNuances Matter\n\nIn a single Exposure preset, many small effects work together to achieve a coherent look. For instance, realistic grain clumps together and is stronger in the midtones. The results feel real, even when the effect is not intense. Some Exposure looks are so subtle that people wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t consciously realize you altered your photo.\n\nTo discover all the subtle details, our research included test shoots with films that were still available. For discontinued films we relied on photo archives and the professionals who created them. The anthropology of learning from film photographers was as important as the chemistry and math.\n\nDevelop Your Style \n\nExposureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s presets are beautiful and diverse, but they are just starting points for your own unique style. If you discover a preset that sparks an idea, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to mold it to fit your needs. Save your new look as a preset with a name, category, and even include notes. Later, you can apply it to a photo (or batches of photos) with a single click.\n\nWorks Everywhere\n\nExposure 5 fits into any workflow. It integrates seamlessly with Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, Lightroom, and now Aperture. Exposure now works as a standalone application too. This helps you quickly batch process multiple images and supports workflows that donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use plug-ins.\n\nNew in Exposure 5\n\nThe Right Looks in a Flash\n\nChoosing your look is the focus of Exposure, so the preset browser now uses thumbnails for a more visual experience. You can quickly filter by categories like Black &amp; White or Color. Find specific looks with fast searching by name or description. In Exposure 5 you can tag your favorites so you can get back to them later. Your most recently applied effects are automatically remembered too. \n\nInterface - Focus on WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Important \n\nExposureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s updated user interface lets you work with fewer distractions. The darker theme helps you focus on your image and matches other tools in a professional workflow. The new Lightroom-style collapsible panels allow you to see only the controls you care about. Tools that get out of the way provide more space for your photo.\n\nTextures - A World of Creative Textures\n\nExposure 5 has even more texture overlays that add creative details for vintage or Lo-Fi looks. You can now separately control light leaks, borders, and dust &amp; scratches. The new randomize button helps you quickly explore similar textures.\n\nSystem Requirements \n\n- Microsoft Windows users need Windows 7 or newer\n- An Intel Core 2 processor or compatible\n- A monitor with 1280x768 resolution or greater \n\nHost Requirements\n\nExposure 5 may be used as a standalone program or a plug-in. When Exposure is used as a plug-in it requires one of these host applications: \n- Adobe Photoshop CS5 or newer \n- Adobe Photoshop Elements 10 or newer\n- Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 4 or newer \n\nLanguage : English\n\nHomepage :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alienskin.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alienskin.com/&lt;/a&gt; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fd4e478cb729095baf4258281a846b913fe514c","amp;dn":"Alien+Skin+Exposure+5.0.0.701+%2832+-+64+bit%29+%5BChingLiu%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fd4e478cb729095baf4258281a846b913fe514c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,212,228,120,203,114,144,149,186,244,37,130,129,168,70,185,19,254,81,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
