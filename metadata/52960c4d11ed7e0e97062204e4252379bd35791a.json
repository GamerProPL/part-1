It debuted in the U.S. on NBC on October 28, 2011. The show has been described as &quot;a cop dramaÃ¢â‚¬â€with a twist... a dark and fantastical project about a world in which characters inspired by Grimms' Fairy Tales exist&quot;, although the stories and characters inspiring the show are also drawn from other sources.\n\n\nSeries synopsis:\n----------\nHomicide Detective Nick Burkhardt of the Portland Police Bureau learns he is descended from a line of &quot;guardians&quot; known as &quot;Grimms,&quot; charged with keeping balance between humanity and the mythological creatures of the world called Wesen, the German word for being or creature (pronounced &quot;vessin&quot; on the show; German pronunciation: ['ve?zn?]). Throughout the series, he must battle against an assortment of dangerous creatures, with help from his friend Monroe (who is a reformed creature), and his partner Detective Hank Griffin. \nOpening (early season 2): &quot;There once was a man who lived a life so strange, it had to be true. Only he could see what no one else canÃ¢â‚¬â€the darkness inside...the real monster within...and he's the one who must stop them. This is his calling. This is his duty. This is the life of a Grimm.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nCast: David Giuntoli\n      Russell Hornsby\n      Bitsie Tulloch\n      Silas Weir Mitchell\n      Sasha Roiz\n      Reggie Lee\n      Bree Turner\n      Claire Coffee\n\n\nSpecs:\n----------\nFile Types: Mkv or Matroska Multimedia Container\nVideo Codec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC(part10)(avc1)\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: None \nResolution: 1280x720\nFrame Rate: 23.976215\nAudio Codec: A52 Audio  (aka AC3)(a52)\nChanels: 3F2R/LFE\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 384 kb/s\nSource: HDTV Rips\nTested with VLC on PC and WDTV Media Player on T.V.\n\n\nActual Screenshots:\n----------  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/6721/bt4a.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/6721/bt4a.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/7215/3uwl.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/7215/3uwl.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/471/ki7.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/471/ki7.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/6825/wx9r.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/6825/wx9r.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/6774/yfnr.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/6774/yfnr.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nIMDb Link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1830617/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1830617/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOfficial Website: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nbc.com/grimm/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nbc.com/grimm/&lt;/a&gt; \n\nWiki:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm_(TV_series)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm_(TV_series)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nMuch admiration to release groups and encoders such as IMMERSE, EVOLVE, CtrlHD, DHD, YesTV, MVGroup and KiNGS.\n\n\nOther CARG releases can be found at ExtraTorrent &amp; KickassTorrent\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52960c4d11ed7e0e97062204e4252379bd35791a","amp;dn":"Grimm+Season+1+and+2+Complete+720p+HD+%5BCARG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52960c4d11ed7e0e97062204e4252379bd35791a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,150,12,77,17,237,126,14,151,6,34,4,228,37,35,121,189,53,121,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
