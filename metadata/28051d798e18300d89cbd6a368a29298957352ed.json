Widely considered one of the finest living English-language short story writers, her stories focus on human relationships looked at through the lens of daily life. While most of Munro's fiction is set in Southwestern Ontario, her reputation as a short-story writer is international. Her &quot;accessible, moving stories&quot; explore human complexities in a seemingly effortless style. Munro's writing has established her as &quot;one of our greatest contemporary writers of fiction,&quot; or, as Cynthia Ozick put it, &quot;our Chekhov.&quot; \n\nNovels\n\nLives of Girls and Women (1971)\nThe Beggar Maid (1979) aka Who Do You Think You Are?\n\n \nCollections\nThe Moons of Jupiter (1982)\nThe Progress of Love (1986)\nFriend of My Youth (1990)\nThe Love of a Good Woman (1998)\nRunaway (2004)\nThe View from Castle Rock (2006)\nAlice Munro's Best (2008)\nToo Much Happiness (2009)\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28051d798e18300d89cbd6a368a29298957352ed","amp;dn":"Alice+Munro+Ebook+Collection+%28bookeek%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28051d798e18300d89cbd6a368a29298957352ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,5,29,121,142,24,48,13,137,203,214,163,104,162,146,152,149,115,82,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
