At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 66 based on 10 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.\n\n, but doesn't live up to their debut, Hybrid Theory (2000). David Buchanan of Consequence of Sound gave the album three-and-a-half out of five, saying, &quot;Some might argue this new sound is posturing, complete mutation to the point of absurdity; in the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s associated artwork and videos, evolution has been touted from day one. In essence, Linkin Park has been chasing this all along, and now it has become tangible, complete.&quot; Johan Wippsson from Melodic felt that Linkin Park &quot;have created a very cool and unique sound&quot; and described the tracks &quot;Blackout&quot; and &quot;When They Come for Me&quot; as &quot;really innovative.&quot; Ian Winwood of BBC Music, opening his review of the band's succeeding album, Living Things, expressed praise for A Thousand Suns, describing it as &quot;a body of work startling enough that it gambled with the massive commercial success the group had achieved since their debut album, 2000's Hybrid Theory.&quot;\n\n\nMikael Wood with Spin gave it six out of ten stars, saying that it &quot;contains plenty of aggressively arty material&quot; and called the track &quot;The Messenger&quot; the &quot;most unexpected track on the ill conceived A Thousand Suns&quot;.Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B rating and said &quot;on A Thousand Suns at times the band's odd mÃƒÂ©lange of industrial grind, hip-hop swagger, and teenage-wasteland angst feels jarring&quot;. Jody Rosen with Rolling Stone gave it three out of five stars, saying they are &quot;feeling their way toward a new identity&quot;, although she defined their skill for melody as &quot;obvious&quot; and said that they sounded like &quot;a killer Linkin Park tribute band&quot;. Australia's Music Network magazine gave the album a mixed review, stating it is &quot;a radical shift for the band, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a very uneven one... while there's some commanding moments ('The Catalyst,' 'Wretches and Kings'), many of the tracks feel like experiments rather than fully-formed songs&quot;.\n\nHowever, Johnny Firecloud with Antiquiet condemned the album, referring to it as a &quot;melodramatic farce&quot;, and said it was a &quot;mechanized mess of sentimentality [...] the 15 track collection is entirely unconvincing as a call to action for uprising and activism&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine with Allmusic commented that the album was a &quot;clear continuation&quot; of its predecessor, referring to it as &quot;recycled ideas&quot; and saying that &quot;the problem is, the subdued rhythms, riffs and raps of A Thousand Suns winds up monochromatic&quot;. Jim Farber of The New York Daily News gave the album one star of five, stating that &quot;no fewer than 15 cuts crowd the tight 47-minute length of the CD, many of them fragments or, more accurately, sonic non sequiturs&quot;. Jamie Primack of The Badger Herald wrote that &quot;there are at least five filler tracks that contain nothing more than noise and sound bites [....] the full-length songs arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t particularly daring or interesting&quot;.\n\nFans of the band were equally polarized with A Thousand Suns. Initial signs of the fans' division over the band's new material was when &quot;The Catalyst&quot; was released. MTV conducted a poll on how fans received the song; a large amount were dissatisfied. Fans then therefore debated on what they thought of the new sound. Sara Ferrer of Orange County Reloaded stated that the album split the views of fans and critics into &quot;love-it versus hate-it groups&quot;. Montgomery expressed similar sentiments, saying that the album &quot;alternately thrilled and thinned LP's substantial fanbase with its vast swaths of sonic sprawl (and overall lack of guitar solos).&quot; Shinoda shared his thoughts on the divided reception of the fans; he thanked the people that accepted the album, while he defended it from the criticism of the people who dislike A Thousand Suns. Commenting on the album's polarized response from fans, Bennington said: &quot;[A Thousand Suns] is definitely something that we knew people would need to digest and get over the fact that it's not what they thought we would do.&quot;No. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;The Requiem&quot;   \t2:01\n2. \t&quot;The Radiance&quot; (featuring a speech from J.
