It is set to be released in the United Kingdom on 1 March 2010.\n\nGoulding worked with producers Starsmith and Fraser T. Smith. The majority of the album was recorded in Starsmith's bedroom in Bromley, London. Goulding explained that the album &quot;is made up of songs that all started on a guitar over a period of about two years. A number of the songs vent romantic victories and failures.&quot; She revealed that the first song she ever wrote, &quot;Wish I Stayed&quot;, is featured on the album.\n\n# \tTitle                                      Length\n1. \t&quot;Guns and Horses&quot;   \t \t           3:35\n2. \t&quot;Starry Eyed&quot;   \t\t           2:56\n3. \t&quot;This Love (Will Be Your Downfall)&quot;   \t   3:53\n4. \t&quot;Under the Sheets&quot;   \t\t           3:44\n5. \t&quot;The Writer&quot;   \t                           4:11\n6. \t&quot;Every Time You Go&quot;   \t\t           3:25\n7. \t&quot;Wish I Stayed&quot;   \t \t           3:40\n8. \t&quot;Your Biggest Mistake&quot;   \t \t   3:25\n9. \t&quot;I'll Hold My Breath&quot;   \t  \t   3:45\n10. \t&quot;Salt Skin&quot;   \t  \t                   4:17\n\nPlease support the artist by purchasing the album on release.\n\nUntil then enjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:543f038db21f00102f4e247fa79068c9d298a294","amp;dn":"Ellie+Goulding+-+Lights+%282010+Album+%2B+Cover%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"543f038db21f00102f4e247fa79068c9d298a294","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,63,3,141,178,31,0,16,47,78,36,127,167,144,104,201,210,152,162,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
