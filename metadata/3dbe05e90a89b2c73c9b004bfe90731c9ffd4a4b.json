Considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century, he was awarded the 1972 Neustadt International Prize for Literature and the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nGarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories but is best known for his novels such as ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE (1970) and LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA (1988).  His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style labeled as magic realism, which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations.  Some of his works are set in a fictional village called Macondo (the town mainly inspired by his birthplace Aracataca), and most of them express the theme of solitude.\n\n\nThis collection represents a substantial improvement over my previous GarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez collection.
