Here they forgot the over commercialism of 'Puzzle' in favour of a\nreturn to their classic style welding emo-style structures to technically\ncomplex math- and jazzcore elements. Named for the novel by Mark Danielewski,\nproduced once again by Garth Richardson (Gallows) and with striking cover\nartwork shot by the legendary Storm Thorgerson, the album includes the singles\n'Mountains', 'The Captain' and 'That Golden Rule'.\n\nEnjoy!
