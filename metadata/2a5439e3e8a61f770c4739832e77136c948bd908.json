All the other copies seem to be with UK English with everything spelled &quot;wrong&quot;. For example, &quot;color settings&quot; will be &quot;Colour Settings&quot;. \n\nAfter weeks of frustration searching torrent sites to find a legitimate copy I decided to just pay the $39.99 and buy it so I could share the one true copy with everyone through the interwebs.\n\n\nWhen I installed this copy of Windows 8 it was the 64-bit version. You can try installing it with less than 8GB of RAM maybe it will detect that and install the 32-bit version. I'm not sure about that though. \n\n\n1. Burn ISO image to a DVD disc using Imageburn or other software\n2. Install as per instructions\n\nOR\n\n1. Create a bootable USB Drive\n2. Download &quot;Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool&quot; DIRECTLY from Microsoft\n (http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/html/pbPage.Help_Win7_usbdvd_dwnTool)\n\n3. Install and follow the instructions to create a bootable USB Drive\n\n \n\n\nCheck your BIOS so to select the proper &quot;Boot Device Priority&quot; so the USB drive is #1\n\n If that doesn't work check the BIOS &quot;Boot Order&quot; and select your USB Storage Device as the First Hard Drive to boot from.\n\n\n**It might ask you for a Product Key during Installation, this is because this is a legitimate copy of windows 8. Try to leave it blank and continue...\n\n**I had a pirated copy of windows 7 when I went to the Microsoft site to upgrade, the upgrade adviser did not check whether or not I had a legit copy, so feel free to pay the $39.99 for a key, and that's until January 31st 2013, then the price goes up.
