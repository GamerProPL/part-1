The two had previously been bandmates for years in various bands, of which the most notable is without doubts Operation ivy (1987-1989), one of the first bands of the well known Gilman St. scene. The band played a huge amount of shows and helped to set down the guidelines for what would become a genre of its own: Ska-Punk.\n\nWhen Operation Ivy broke up, it was due to various valid reasons. But while the other members had moved on to form other bands, Armstrong found himself lost and without purpose, having the band been his only focus for 2 years. He fell into alcoholism and spent the next two years in and out of detox centers, risking his life at least once due to a crisis caused by an abnormally high percentage of alcohol in his blood. Meanwhile, Freeman got involved with a few bands including MDC, and the G'Rups. He actually tried to take care of Armstrong helping him with money from time to time, and taking him as a rodie during a tour with MDC; however, he was getting frustrated as Armstrong's problems got worse and worse.\n\nEventually, Armstrong found the strenght to quit drinking and at the same time, the money gained with the Operation Ivy releases started to come in. Now with enough money to take care of himself, Armstrong decided to form a new band with his longtime pal. At first Freeman was skeptical, so he kept on playing with his own band as well (the G'rups), but after Armstrong demonstrated him that he really stopped drinking, he committed wholly to the new project. The pair recruited a local skater kid, Brett Reed (who at the time was 19 and barely able to play), and Rancid was born.\n\n...Honor Is All We Know is the upcoming eighth studio album by the American punk rock band Rancid, scheduled for release on October 27, 2014. It will be the band's first studio album since Let the Dominoes Fall (2009), and their second one to be recorded under its current incarnation (Tim Armstrong, Lars Frederiksen, Matt Freeman and Branden Steineckert). Work on Honor Is All We Know began in 2011 and it was originally planned for a 2012 release, but was repeatedly delayed while the band continued touring and writing new material, and its members were busy with their own projects. After three years of writing and recording, the album was finished in 2014. Honor is all We Know is Rancid's shortest record in length clocking in at under 31 minutes, three minutes less than their 1993 self-titled debut album.\n\nRancid began work on Honor Is All We Know as early as 2011. Asked in August 2010 if Rancid was going to release an eighth studio album anytime soon, bassist Matt Freeman replied, &quot;We haven't really figured that out yet. We're not going anywhere [Laughs]. We're going to do something, we just don't know what it is yet. We're always together and we all talk everyday. We're just doing different stuff right now.&quot; On May 27, 2011, Rancid announced that they would do a small US tour supporting Blink-182 from August 25 through September 4, 2011, to enable them to warm up before entering the studio in September to begin recording their eighth studio album with producer Brett Gurewitz. They announced that they would embark on a 20th anniversary world tour in 2012 to accompany the album. However, the album did not arrive in 2012, and frontman Tim Armstrong stated that it would be released after Transplants' third album In a Warzone.\n\nOn February 6, 2013, Rancid uploaded a picture to their Facebook page of the band in the studio with the caption, &quot;Recording has begun.&quot; In a December 2013 interview on Reddit, drummer Branden Steineckert revealed that the eighth Rancid studio album was called Honor Is All We Know, and would be released in early 2014.\nThe track listing and artwork for Honor Is All We Know were revealed on September 28, 2014, and on the day after, Rancid announced that the album will be released on October 27, 2014. Armstrong originally recorded the title track as part of his side project Tim Timebomb.\nOn September 30, 2014, Rancid released a performance video of &quot;Collision Course&quot;, &quot;Honor Is All We Know&quot; and &quot;Evil's My Friend&quot;. The band started to preview the album's songs through their website a few days later with the release of &quot;Face Up&quot; and &quot;Already Dead&quot;, which followed over a week later.\n\n\n\n\nDiscography:\nRancid     1993\nLet's Go     1994\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and Out Come the Wolves     1995\nLife Won't Wait     1998\nRancid     2000\nIndestructible     2003\nLet the Dominoes Fall     2009\nHonor Is All We Know     2014\n\n\n\nLine-Up:\nTim Armstrong Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals, guitars\nLars Frederiksen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars, Vocals\nMatt Freeman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass, Vocals\nBranden Steineckert Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion\n\n\n\nInfo:\nArtist: Rancid\nAlbum: Honor Is All We Know\nGenre: Punk\nSubGenre:  Punk-Ska\nCountry Of Origin: U.S.A.\nRelease date: October 27th, 2014\nAudio codec: MP3\nRiptype: Tracks\nBitrate: 320 kbps\nSize: 78.2 MB\nIncluded - Front Cover\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
