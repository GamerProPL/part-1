His breakthrough didn't come until late 2004, as the co-songwriter of Mario's &quot;Let Me Love You,&quot; a number one Hot 100 hit that Billboard later determined to be the eighth most successful single of the decade. By the close of 2009, however, Ne-Yo had racked up a career's worth of accomplishments. He released three albums, all of which went platinum in the United States. Seven of his singles, as well as five on which he appeared as a featured artist, peaked within the Top Ten of the country's Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart. BeyoncÃƒÂ©'s &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; and Rihanna's &quot;Take a Bow,&quot; two of the many songs he wrote for other artists, were smash hits as well. His music added a high level of sophistication to pop-R&amp;B while appealing to younger audiences.\n\nArtist...............: Ne-Yo\nAlbum................: The Real Collection\nGenre................: R&amp;B\nSource...............: CD {Def Jam #B0004934-88}\nYear.................: 2014\nQuality..............: Lossy, (CBR 320) Insane\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\n\nRipped by............: vtwin88cube on 4/3/2014\nPosted by............: vtwin88cube on 4/4/2014\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: \nCovers...............: Front \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
