Some/all NXE installs (converted to god) have XSF header stripped and have incorrect offsets in them. I don't know how the xbox works around this, but if I find out I'll be able to add support for them too","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8f9585632a016b879d0af6543b9699a6d69411a","amp;dn":"Iso2God+v1.2.2+and+God2Iso+v1.0.2%5BXbox360%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8f9585632a016b879d0af6543b9699a6d69411a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,249,88,86,50,160,22,184,121,208,175,101,67,185,105,154,109,105,65,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
