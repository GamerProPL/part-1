The revised edition contains the substance of the original translation, slightly emended in light of recent scholarship; three of the original versions have been replaced by new translations; and a new and enlarged selection of fragments has been added. The aim of the translation remains the same: to make the surviving works of Aristotle readily accessible to English-speaking readers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2055b774f295120e43781e2863715fc5162456ae","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Works+of+Aristotle%3A+Revised+Oxford+Translation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2055b774f295120e43781e2863715fc5162456ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,85,183,116,242,149,18,14,67,120,30,40,99,113,95,197,22,36,86,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
