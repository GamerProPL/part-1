Its anarchic, offbeat humour helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. Soon afterwards, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel.\n\nThe main characters were four undergraduate students sharing a house: violent punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), pompous would-be anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), long-suffering hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave and diminutive Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski familyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet's landlordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in &quot;Bambi&quot;.\n\nThe show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a then-up-and-coming pop band, including Madness, MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead, and The Damned.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1fc0b654503c12bac3cc7d6b84f7fbfadc5c85c","amp;dn":"The+Young+Ones+Season+1%2C+2+%2B+Extras+DVDRip+TSV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1fc0b654503c12bac3cc7d6b84f7fbfadc5c85c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,252,11,101,69,3,193,43,172,60,199,214,184,79,127,191,173,197,200,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
