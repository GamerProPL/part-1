Manny may be ready to start a family, but nobody has seen another mammoth for a long time; Manny thinks he may be the last one. That is, until he miraculously finds Ellie, the only female mammoth left in the world. Their only problems: They can't stand each other--and Ellie somehow thinks she's a possum! Ellie comes with some excess baggage in the form of her two possum &quot;brothers&quot;-- Crash and Eddie, a couple of daredevil pranksters and cocky, loud-mouthed troublemakers. Manny, Sid and Diego quickly learn that the warming climate has one major drawback: A huge glacial dam holding off oceans of water is about to break, threatening the entire valley. The only chance of survival lies at the other end of the valley...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438097/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438097/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFormat            : AVI at 2223 Kbps\nLength            : 1 GiB for 1h 26mn 52s 880ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1831 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 400 (1.800) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 384 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\n\n\nIce Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (2009) \n\nDirectors:Carlos Saldanha, Mike Thurmeier\nWriters: Peter Ackerman, Michael Berg\n\nStoryline\n\nAfter the events of &quot;Ice Age: The Meltdown&quot;, life begins to change for Manny and his friends: Scrat is still on the hunt to hold onto his beloved acorn, while finding a possible romance in a female sabre-toothed squirrel named Scratte.
