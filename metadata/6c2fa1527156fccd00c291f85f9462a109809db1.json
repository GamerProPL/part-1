Crash a balsa model and you'll even see wood dust appear after the impact! And now Real RenderingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ gives you even greater detail without increasing the workload on your computer.\n  Want to fly with a friend? No problem! RealFlight G4.5 lets you fly with up to seven other pilots at once ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ whether they're as close as the next room or on the other side of the world! Two-pilot flight is also easier than ever. Just connect your own radio transmitter for multi-mode flight ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ no need to buy another controller! Other exciting new features let you add your own headset to chat with other pilots ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlive,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and offer the ability to block out unwanted users!\n  And let's not forget the features RealFlight is famous for: exciting night flying, coaching from Virtual Flight Instructors, easy push-button resets, AccuModelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ aircraft editor with over 1,500 airfoil choices, over 5,000 square miles of 3D TruLifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ terrain and much, much more!
