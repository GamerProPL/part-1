Set in the director's hometown of Rimini, I Vitelloni follows the lives of five young vitelloni, or layabouts, who while away their listless days in their small seaside village. Fausto (Franco Fabrizi), the leader of the pack, marries his sweetheart, but finds himself constantly distracted by other women. Meanwhile, would-be playwright Leopoldo (Leopoldo Trieste) continues work on his dreary plays, dreaming of staging them one day. Clownish Alberto (Alberto Sordi) still lives at home with his mother and sister, Olga (Claude Farell), while boasting of preserving the family honor by watching over her. While the movie seems to pay little attention to Riccardo (Riccardo Fellini) and Moraldo (Franco Interlenghi), the latter eventually emerges as its key character, plainly serving as Fellini's alter ego. Stuck in adolescence, the five friends stumble into various misadventures, as they seek to spice up their uneventful provincial lives. Ultimately, one of them breaks free from their self-imposed paralysis and moves on, leading to one of the most poignant farewell sequences in film history. A hit in Italy upon its release, I Vitelloni secured Fellini's reputation as an up-and-coming talent, while also introducing its title into Italian vernacular. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Vitelloni.I.1953.DVDrip.Xvid.Ac3.Alaundo.cd1.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 697 MiB\n      PlayTime : 50mn 21s\n      Bit rate : 1930 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 4.52 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.1 (build 2439/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2439/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : Yes\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 50mn 21s\n      Bit rate : 1733 Kbps\n      Width : 672 pixels\n      Height : 496 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.216\n      StreamSize : 624 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 50mn 21s\n      Bit rate : 190 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 68.6 MiB\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Vitelloni.I.1953.DVDrip.Xvid.Ac3.Alaundo.cd2.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 697 MiB\n      PlayTime : 57mn 21s\n      Bit rate : 1693 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 5.15 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.1 (build 2439/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2439/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : Yes\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 57mn 21s\n      Bit rate : 1496 Kbps\n      Width : 672 pixels\n      Height : 496 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.186\n      StreamSize : 614 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 57mn 21s\n      Bit rate : 190 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Video0 delay : 24ms\n      StreamSize : 78.1 MiB\n\nIMDB: tt0046521\n\nItalian audio; English and Portuguese subtitles\n\nCriterion rip; posted at KG by zuplucian","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:963cb9f9f26596b94c2e0a93ff497bf21191e3c5","amp;dn":"Fellini+-+1953+-+I+Vitelloni","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"963cb9f9f26596b94c2e0a93ff497bf21191e3c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,60,185,249,242,101,150,185,76,46,10,147,255,73,123,242,17,145,227,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
