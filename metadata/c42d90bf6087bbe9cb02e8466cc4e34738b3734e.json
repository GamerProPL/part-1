Bjarne Stroustrup, the designer and original implementer of C++, thoroughly covers the details of this language and its use in his definitive reference, The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition.\n\nIn A Tour of C++ , Stroustrup excerpts the overview chapters from that complete reference, expanding and enhancing them to give an experienced programmerÃ¢â‚¬â€œin just a few hoursÃ¢â‚¬â€œa clear idea of what constitutes modern C++. In this concise, self-contained guide, Stroustrup covers most major language features and the major standard-library componentsÃ¢â‚¬â€œnot, of course, in great depth, but to a level that gives programmers a meaningful overview of the language, some key examples, and practical help in getting started.\n\nStroustrup presents the C++ features in the context of the programming styles they support, such as object-oriented and generic programming. His tour is remarkably comprehensive. Coverage begins with the basics, then ranges widely through more advanced topics, including many that are new in C++11, such as move semantics, uniform initialization, lambda expressions, improved containers, random numbers, and concurrency. The tour ends with a discussion of the design and evolution of C++ and the extensions added for C++11.\n\nThis guide does not aim to teach you how to program (see StroustrupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ for that); nor will it be the only resource youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need for C++ mastery (see StroustrupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition, for that). If, however, you are a C or C++ programmer wanting greater familiarity with the current C++ language, or a programmer versed in another language wishing to gain an accurate picture of the nature and benefits of modern C++, you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find a shorter or simpler introduction than this tour provides.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c42d90bf6087bbe9cb02e8466cc4e34738b3734e","amp;dn":"A+Tour+of+C%2B%2B+Bjarne+Stroustrup+%5BEpub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c42d90bf6087bbe9cb02e8466cc4e34738b3734e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,45,144,191,96,135,187,233,203,2,232,70,108,196,227,71,56,179,115,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
