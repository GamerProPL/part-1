This hands-on guide takes you through the language a step at a time, beginning with basic programming concepts before moving on to functions, recursion, data structures, and object-oriented design. This second edition and its supporting code have been updated for Python 3.\r\n\r\nThrough exercises in each chapter, youâ€™ll try out programming concepts as you learn them. Think Python is ideal for students at the high school or college level, as well as self-learners, home-schooled students, and professionals who need to learn programming basics. Beginners just getting their feet wet will learn how to start with Python in a browser.\r\nStart with the basics, including language syntax and semantics\r\nGet a clear definition of each programming concept\r\nLearn about values, variables, statements, functions, and data structures in  logical progression\r\nDiscover how to work with files and databases\r\nUnderstand objects, methods, and object-oriented programming\r\nUse debugging techniques to fix syntax, runtime, and semantic errors\r\nExplore interface design, data structures, and GUI-based programs through case studies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19304e4cd43c99ce871cca809b9304e695b28308","amp;dn":"Think+Python%2C+2nd+Ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19304e4cd43c99ce871cca809b9304e695b28308","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,48,78,76,212,60,153,206,135,28,202,128,155,147,4,230,149,178,131,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
