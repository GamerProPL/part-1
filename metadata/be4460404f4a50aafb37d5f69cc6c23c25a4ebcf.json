This type of game is also known as a dungeon crawler, in which the player takes his/her character through progressively difficult levels of a dungeon, fighting monsters, completing quests, collecting valuable items and gold, and improving the character's attributes and skills along the way. The dungeon in Fate has a randomized layout for each level; treasures found within each level are randomized, as are the number and type of monsters. Fate is rendered fully in 3D, allowing the player to zoom in and out of the action as necessary.\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nPets and fishing\nThe player is accompanied by a pet, which can initially be chosen as a dog or cat. This pet fights on behalf of the player, can carry items, and can be sent back to town in order to sell unwanted findings (though it cannot collect rewards for fetch quests). If the pet's Health Points are driven down to zero (due to blows or damaging spells from enemies) it does not die, but merely flees the fight. Hence, the game's introduction describes the pet as invincible since it cannot be killed. It will still follow the character, but it won't fight until it is healed. If this happens then you can send it to town and it will be healed. The player can transform the pet into various more powerful creatures by feeding it fish, which can be caught in fishing holes found throughout the game or purchased from vendors. Some of these transformations are temporary, some can be made permanent.\n\nIt is also possible to get rare items from fish. A patient player who takes time to fish can make their character very wealthy, and obtain top-notch gear. The Player's Manual says, &quot;Finding or purchasing a fishing pole is one of the best investments you can make in the game.&quot; There is also a fishing hole in the town that, if the player chooses, can be very helpful in getting one's character started (i.e., getting money with which to purchase better gear than the character starts out with) before braving the dungeon. The deeper the character is in the dungeon, the better items and more powerful pet transformations they can find while angling.\n-------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nPlayer characters\nWhen the character gains enough experience points, he/she is promoted to the next character level and given five Attribute points as well as two Skill points. Increasing the four attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Vitality and Magic) allow the character to wield stronger weapons, armor and magical spells, while Skills denote proficiency at certain things (Sword Skill, Charm Magic Skill, Critical Strike Skill, etc.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½there are a total of 15 different Skills). There are no set character classes in Fate, allowing maximum customization. Additionally, the player is rewarded with Fame points for completing side-quests and defeating enemy bosses, which contribute to the gaining of Fame levels. Four Skill Points are awarded for gaining a Fame level. Elite and Legendary equipment cannot be used unless the player is of a certain Fame level. Certain items (i.e., weapons, armor, and jewelry) contain sockets, into which the player can put special gems in order to customize the item. Having sockets does not create higher requirements for using an item, although they make the item more valuable. Finally, a denizen of Grove, specifically a minstrel, can be paid to increase the character's Fame, &quot;allowing savvy players to buy Skill points.&quot;\n--------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNon-player characters and quests\nSeveral townspeople of Grove offer randomized side-quests to the player. These are sometimes called fetch quests (retrieving a valuable item from the dungeon), though they often require the player to kill off all enemies of a certain type on a certain level of the dungeon or dispatch an enemy boss. Upon completion of a side-quest, the player can return to the townsperson who gave it to them, and receive a reward of Fame Points, Experience Points and gold. Sometimes a valuable item is also given as part of the reward for completing a side-quest. In the case of a fetch quest, players can always decide if they want to keep the item they were sent to retrieve, or if the potential rewards for turning it in to the quest-giver are more important. Other non-player townspeople include vendors, selling arms, armor, potions, etc.\n\nIn addition to the various vendors and quest-givers in the town, there is also a Healer, who will bring the character's and his/her pet's Health Points up to full capacity free of charge, and an Enchanter who, for a fee, will try (sometimes unsuccessfully) to add an enchantment or a socket to an item of the player's choosing. However, once in a while he will accidentally delete all of the item's enchantments or even put a curse on the item, reducing its usefulness.\n\nSometimes a vendor will appear in the dungeon. Vendors and townspeople are non-player characters (NPCs). They all have neutral status in the game, so enemies won't attack them. The character cannot be attacked by enemies while engaged in buying or selling with a vendor. Vendors who appear in the dungeon are Pikko the Fisherman and Getts the Traveler.\n\nPikko the Fisherman sells a large array of fish, which can be used to transform your pet into a variety of different creatures. The further down you are in the dungeon, the better the fish Pikko will sell. Also, Pikko always has a fishing pole in stock.\n\nGetts the Traveler, who can also be seen in the Town of Grove, retails various arms, armor, spells, gems, and other things.\n------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nDeath\nIf at any point in the game the character dies (Health Points driven down to zero) the death is not permanent. The personification of Fate appears, who resembles the Grim Reaper. Fate offers the player three choices: first, the character can be brought back to life at the spot where s/he fell, in exchange for a portion of their Experience Points and Fame Points. Second, they can be brought back to life and transported to a nearby level (one or two levels up or down) in exchange for a portion of the character's gold. This new place may be safer or more dangerous than the one where the character died. Third, the character can be brought back to life and transported three levels up in exchange for all the gold in their possession. This new location is usually safer than where the death occurred. (If the character died on level 1, 2, or 3 of the dungeon they will be taken back to town.) If the player chooses this third option and can make it back to the exact spot where his/her character fell before the dungeon level regenerates, his/her gold will be waiting in a pile for them to pick up. (If the character stays out of a previously visited dungeon level for 20 minutes on the game clock, the level will be automatically refreshed with all new monsters and treasure, although the dungeon layout stays the same. Therefore, if the character died on that level and doesn't make it back within 20 minutes, any gold they left there when they died will be gone for good. The 20-minute rule does not apply if the character has a portal to that level, since one end of the portal is constantly occupying the level. However, if the character has died and been transported three levels up, there will be no portal.) If none of these three options is to the player's liking, they may choose Quit and the character is effectively transported back in time to the last occasion the game loaded. However, the death is still recorded in the character's journal.\n-------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------\n\nRetirement\nIf the player completes the main quest he/she received at the beginning of the game, he/she is given the option to retire the current character and start play over again with a descendant of the first character. The descendant gets various perks and bonuses, including one item that is handed down from its ancestor. If this family heirloom has any magical enchantments on it, they will be augmented by 25% every time the item is passed down. If a weapon or piece of armor is passed down, its damage done or defensive capabilities will be increased as well. If a player chooses not to retire, they can advance their characters and go as deep into the dungeon as they like.\n--------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------\n\nPlot\nThe game starts in the town of Grove, where on the outskirts of town the ancient Dungeon Gate leads would-be adventurers to multiple levels of fame, fortune, and death. The player assumes the role of one of these adventurers, and is assigned a randomized quest at the beginning of the game that will take them to approximately the 45th level of the dungeon. Along the way, randomized side-quests are made available to the player by the townspeople of Grove. Eventually, the player completes the primary quest by defeating the randomized boss monster.\n--------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------\n\nCustomization\nLike many other games in its class, Fate has an active modding community. The developers have released tools to aid in the creation of mods and over 100 mods exist in a community database. Mods for Fate range from simple potions and weapons to new spells and town make-overs. The community has created tutorials for creating new weapons, armor, spells, monsters, and other such items. One pitfall of these activities is the stability of the game; for this reason, it is recommended that the original game files be backed up prior to the installation of any third-party changes.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHELP ME SEED MY LOW-SEEDED TORRENTS SO I CAN UPLOAD MORE AND NOT WORRY ABOUT THE OLD ONES!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDon't forget to snag a copy of my Land of the Dead torrent (you can play it online).\n\n\nI HAVE A FEW ONLINE PLAYABLE TORRENTS SO FAR:\nLand of the Dead\nPostal 1 and Postal 2 Share The Pain (All Mods)\nSniper Elite\nSerious Sam: The First and Second Encounter\nNexuiz\nDoom Collection (all the older doom games)  NOTE: This Requires a mod to play online (skulltag), it's free, google it\nOTHERS CAN MOST LIKELY BE PLAYED VIA HAMACHI\n\n\nDOWNLOAD ALL MY TORRENTS HERE:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be4460404f4a50aafb37d5f69cc6c23c25a4ebcf","amp;dn":"Fate+1%2C+2%2C+and+3+%28Full+Collection%29+%28Similar+to+Diablo+2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be4460404f4a50aafb37d5f69cc6c23c25a4ebcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,68,96,64,79,74,80,170,251,55,213,246,156,198,194,60,37,164,235,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
