The framing, shot composition and editing techniques all beautifully work together to bring out the story the most dazzling of these being the sequence reminiscing about his son. The dissolves and the matching of shots past to present are used to such effect that the audience is left feeling his pain not of imminent death but wasted life. Special mention must also go to Takashi Shimura's beautiful performance as Mr Watanabe. Shimura and Kurosawa worked many times together, most famously in Seven Samurai where Shimura played the head samurai. As Mr Watanabe, Shimura's mannerisms and reactions take the audience into the inner most depths and thoughts of the character. His performance lingers through the second half even though we barely see him.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Ikiru.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 2,039,824,692 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:23:07\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.1.2 Final\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x480 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1499 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.204 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [], [N-VOP], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [1 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 2\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044741/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044741/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Japanese\nSubtitles: English, Spanish and Portuguese (srt)\n\nCriterion rip, posted originally at kG by charulata, whom we thank","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65252e4d6f07feb31fcb179c28ac2e4326dd69bb","amp;dn":"Akira+Kurosawa+-+Ikiru+%281952%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65252e4d6f07feb31fcb179c28ac2e4326dd69bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,37,46,77,111,7,254,179,31,203,23,156,40,172,46,67,38,221,105,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
