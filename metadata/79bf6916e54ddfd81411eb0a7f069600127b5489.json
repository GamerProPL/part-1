Especially fabulous is &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird,&quot; which allows Davis to show off his talent for turning a simple theme into a complex improvisation using one variation after another. The theme is picked up seamlessly by Coltrane, who precedes each note with his trademark blasts of sound, bringing the tune increasingly far away from the original melody.\n \nThe inclusion of the 1955 sessions highlights Coltrane's evolution away from straight-ahead bebop toward a new intensity and a bold, complex new rhythmic sense.   \n\n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79bf6916e54ddfd81411eb0a7f069600127b5489","amp;dn":"Miles+Davis+%2F+John+Coltrane+-+Miles+%26amp%3B+Coltrane+1958","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79bf6916e54ddfd81411eb0a7f069600127b5489","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,191,105,22,229,77,223,216,20,17,235,10,127,6,150,0,18,123,84,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
