Sixth in the Dublin Murder Squad series.\r\n\r\nFrom Amazon:\r\n\r\nâ€œAtmospheric and unputdownable.â€ â€“ People \r\n \r\nA brilliant new novel from the New York Times bestselling author, whom Gillian Flynn calls &quot;mesmerizing&quot; and Stephen King calls &quot;incandescent.&quot;\r\n\r\nBeing on the Murder squad is nothing like Detective Antoinette Conway dreamed it would be. Her partner, Stephen Moran, is the only person who seems glad sheâ€™s there. The rest of her working life is a stream of thankless cases, vicious pranks, and harassment. Antoinette is savagely tough, but sheâ€™s getting close to the breaking point. \r\n \r\nTheir new case looks like yet another by-the-numbers loversâ€™ quarrel gone bad. Aislinn Murray is blond, pretty, groomed to a shine, and dead in her catalogue-perfect living room, next to a table set for a romantic dinner. Thereâ€™s nothing unusual about herâ€”except that Antoinetteâ€™s seen her somewhere before.\r\n \r\nAnd that her death wonâ€™t stay in its neat by-numbers box. Other detectives are trying to push Antoinette and Steve into arresting Aislinnâ€™s boyfriend, fast. Thereâ€™s a shadowy figure at the end of Antoinette's road. Aislinn's friend is hinting that she knew Aislinn was in danger. And everything they find out about Aislinn takes her further from the glossy, passive doll she seemed to be.\r\n \r\nAntoinette knows the harassment has turned her paranoid, but she canâ€™t tell just how far gone she is. Is this case another step in the campaign to force her off the squad, or are there darker currents flowing beneath its polished surface?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73dd0ea79853b6c935b4a365cd730c83cab9dd62","amp;dn":"The+Trespasser+-+Tana+French+%28epub+%26amp%3B+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73dd0ea79853b6c935b4a365cd730c83cab9dd62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,221,14,167,152,83,182,201,53,180,163,101,205,115,12,131,202,185,221,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
