The\nalbum&amp;#039;s lead single, &quot;So What&quot;, has been the biggest solo\nsuccess of Pink&amp;#039;s career to date, topping the charts in\neleven countries so far, including her native United\nStates, and also in the UK, and reaching the top 10 in\nmany others.\n\nOriginally, Pink wanted to call her album &amp;#039;Heartbreak is\na Motherfucker&amp;#039; but her record label declined this\ndecision because of the fear of lack of sales due to\noffensive language.
