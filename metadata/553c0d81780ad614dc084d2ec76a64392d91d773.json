December 4, 1993) was an American composer, guitarist, singer, and film director.. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa established himself as a prolific and highly distinctive musician, composer and band leader. He worked in almost every musical genre and wrote music for rock bands, jazz ensembles, synthesizers and symphony orchestra, as well as radiophonic works constructed from pre-recorded, synthesized or sampled sources. In addition to his music recordings, he created feature-length and short films, music videos, and album covers.\n\nAlthough he only occasionally achieved major commercial success, he maintained a highly productive career that encompassed composing, recording, touring, producing and merchandising his own and others&amp;#039; music. Zappa self-produced almost every one of the more than sixty albums he released with the Mothers of Invention or as a solo artist. He received multiple Grammy nominations and won for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1988 for the album Jazz From Hell.  Zappa was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, and received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997. In 2005, his 1968 album with the Mothers of Invention, We&amp;#039;re Only in It for the Money, was inducted into the United States National Recording Preservation Board&amp;#039;s National Recording Registry. The same year, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked him #71 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\n\nStrictly Commercial is a compilation album by Frank Zappa. It was released in 1995, 2 years after his death. Strictly Commercial was issued in a limited edition double vinyl release, and CDs, with three different track listings in versions released in America, Europe, and Japan. \n\nIn 2004, the compilation&amp;#039;s track listing was shortened and released as The Best of Frank Zappa in Europe. The compilation was ranked number 64 on the October 2006 issue of Guitar World magazine&amp;#039;s list of the greatest 100 guitar albums of all time.\n\nThe Best of Frank Zappa\n&quot;Peaches en Regalia&quot; ? 3:37 \n&quot;Don&amp;#039;t Eat the Yellow Snow&quot; (Single version) ? 3:34 \n&quot;Dancin&amp;#039; Fool&quot; ? 3:43 \n&quot;San Ber&amp;#039;dino&quot; ? 5:57 \n&quot;Dirty Love&quot; ? 2:57 \n&quot;My Guitar Wants to Kill Your Mama&quot; ? 3:31 \n&quot;Cosmik Debris&quot; ? 4:14 \n&quot;Disco Boy&quot; ? 5:08 \n&quot;Fine Girl&quot; ? 3:29 \n&quot;I&amp;#039;m the Slime&quot; ? 3:34 \n&quot;Joe&amp;#039;s Garage&quot; (Single version) ? 4:08 \n&quot;Bobby Brown Goes Down&quot; ? 2:49 \n&quot;Montana&quot; (Single version) ? 4:48 \n&quot;Valley Girl&quot; (Frank Zappa, Moon Zappa) ? 4:50 \n&quot;Muffin Man&quot; ? 5:33\n\nEnjoy! and please seed..\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:553c0d81780ad614dc084d2ec76a64392d91d773","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+The+Best+of+-+2004","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"553c0d81780ad614dc084d2ec76a64392d91d773","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,60,13,129,120,10,214,20,220,8,77,46,199,106,100,57,45,145,215,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
