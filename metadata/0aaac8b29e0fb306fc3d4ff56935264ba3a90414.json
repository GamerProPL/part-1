This tutorial continues where Mike left off with the Beginners Learning C++ training course from Infinite Skills.\n\nYou jump right in to the training with a review of Inheritance. You will learn advanced topics in this training course such as Polymorphism, creating templates, working with exception handling, stream input/output management, associative containers, algorithms, stacks, queues and binary trees, different search and sort methods, namespaces and working with advanced string class methods.\n\nBy the completion of this advanced training course for C++, you will have an in-depth understanding of how to apply advanced programming techniques to achieve your software development needs. Working files are included to allow you to learn using the same files that the author using in this video training course for C++.\n\nContents:\n01. Introduction/Inheritance\n02. Polymorphism\n03.
