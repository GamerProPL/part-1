He also believes that many tenets of the various \r\nreligions worldwide will end up being self-fulfilling prophecies because \r\nman can now achieve them. He has trouble understanding the long held tenets \r\nthat, if described today in any other western context, would be deemed \r\ncrazy, such as the story of Jonah and the big fish, or a virgin birth. \r\nMaher has discussions with leaders and followers of various religions, \r\nboth in the mainstream and on the fringe, to try and understand why their \r\nbeliefs are so strong, while both sides try to convince the other to see \r\nthings from the other side. Specifically with United States based \r\nChristianity, he has discussions with those associated on what seem to be \r\nthe inherent incompatible beliefs of Americans, such as between religion \r\nand science, nationalism, and consumerism, as well as the incongruence \r\nbetween the purported plain life of Jesus against the wealthy opulence \r\nof modern day Christian monuments and most Christian leaders. Although \r\nfocused primarily on Christianity, he looks at Judaism, Islam and what \r\nmay be considered more fringe religions such as Mormonism and \r\nScientology, not only in and of themselves, but also their tolerance, \r\nor what is more often their intolerance for views other than their own, \r\nincluding that of other religions.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Bill Maher.\r\n=&gt;-Tal Bachman.\r\n=&gt;-Jonathan Boulden.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Larry Charles.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Documentary : Drama : Comedy.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2008.\r\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.42 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 007 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 40mn.\r\n=&gt;-Religulous 2008............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/religulous/\r\n=&gt;-Religulous 2008............: http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/religulous/\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 16:9.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 720.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 890 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 163 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3586c3ad1b9336288f8dc93c3312f2a66bc1e2b","amp;dn":"Religulous+-+Bill+Maher+Documentary+Comedy+2008+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3586c3ad1b9336288f8dc93c3312f2a66bc1e2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,88,108,58,209,185,51,98,136,248,220,147,195,49,47,42,102,188,30,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
