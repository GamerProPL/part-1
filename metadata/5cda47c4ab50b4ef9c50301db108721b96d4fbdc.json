To date, they have released six studio albums, six EPs and twenty-nine singles. The band have gained a considerable amount of international recognition, selling over one million albums in the UK and over ten million worldwide.\n\nPlacebo are best known for hit songs such as &quot;Pure Morning&quot;, &quot;Every You Every Me&quot;, &quot;Infra-Red&quot;, and covers of The Pixies' &quot;Where Is My Mind&quot; and Kate Bush's &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;. Their style has varied greatly. The band's first album featured a raw sound and a fairly minimalistic instrumental lineup, but subsequent albums have had a slower, more melancholic tone, and they started experimenting with synthesizers and other, less traditional, forms of sound production (particularly after Black Market Music).\n\n.: Placebo Group :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img205.imageshack.us/img205/4998/placebozu8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img205.imageshack.us/img205/4998/placebozu8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nTitolo: Placebo - 1996\n\n      01.
