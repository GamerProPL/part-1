He also was one of the faces of pop music -- as a charismatic star who often stole the show when producing and/or guesting on other artists' hit singles. His presence was unfading, whether he was in front of a music video or behind a beat. To trace the beginning of his ascent, you have to go back to 1992, when Teddy Riley tapped him to write a verse for Wreckx-n-Effect's &quot;Rump Shaker.&quot; Since the late '90s, Williams and longtime friend Chad Hugo -- known together as the Neptunes -- began scoring songwriting and production assignments that slowly but steadily infiltrated mainstream music, whether it was via dance-pop (Britney Spears' &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot;), hardcore rap (Clipse's &quot;Grindin'&quot;), or contemporary R&amp;B (Babyface's &quot;There She Goes&quot;). Williams and Hugo were relatively obscure during the mid-'90s, doing spare work for the likes of SWV, Total, and Mase, but they would eventually develop a style that would become as recognized and as mimicked as that of fellow Virginia Beach native Timbaland. (Prior to stardom, all three producers were in a band together called Surrounded by Idiots.) \n\nArtist...............: Pharrell Williams\nAlbum................: In My Mind\nGenre................: R&amp;B\nSource...............: CD {Star Trak Entertainment B0007380-02}\nYear.................: 2006\nRipper...............: NMR\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.1.2 20050205\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 66 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: NMR\nPosted by............: vtwin88cube on 3/3/2014\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: NFO, MD5, LOG, CUE\nCovers...............: Front Back CD \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
