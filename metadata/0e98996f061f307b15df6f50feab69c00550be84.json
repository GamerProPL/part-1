A dangerous path.\n\nRigg is well trained at keeping secrets. Only his father knows the truth about Rigg's strange talent for seeing the paths of people's pasts. But when his father dies, Rigg is stunned to learn just how many secrets Father had kept from him--secrets about Rigg's own past, his identity, and his destiny. And when Rigg discovers that he has the power not only to see the past, but also to change it, his future suddenly becomes anything but certain.\n\nRiggÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s birthright sets him on a path that leaves him caught between two factions, one that wants him crowned and one that wants him dead. He will be forced to question everything he thinks he knows, choose who to trust, and push the limits of his talentÃ¢â‚¬Â¦or forfeit control of his destiny.\n\nRuins\nWhen Rigg and his friends crossed the Wall between the only world they knew and a world they could not imagine, he hoped he was leading them to safety. But the dangers in this new wallfold are more difficult to see. Rigg, Umbo, and Param know that they cannot trust the expendable, Vadesh Ã¢â‚¬â€ a machine shaped like a human, created to deceive Ã¢â‚¬â€ but they are no longer certain that they can even trust one another. But they will have little choice. Because although Rigg can decipher the paths of the past, he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t yet see the horror that lies ahead: A destructive force with deadly intentions is hurtling toward Garden. If Rigg, Umbo, and Param canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work together to alter the past, there will be no future.\n\nVisitors \nFrom the internationally bestselling author of EnderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Game comes the riveting finale to the story of Rigg, a teenager who possesses a secret talent that allows him to see the paths of peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pasts.\n\nIn Pathfinder, Rigg joined forces with another teen with special talents on a quest to find RiggÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sister and discover the true depth and significance of their powers. Then RiggÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story continued in Ruins as he was tasked to decipher the paths of the past before the arrival of a destructive force with deadly intentions. Now, in Visitors, RiggÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey comes to an epic and explosive conclusion as everything that has been building up finally comes to pass, and Rigg is forced to put his powers to the test in order to save his world and end the war once and for all","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e98996f061f307b15df6f50feab69c00550be84","amp;dn":"Pathfinder+Trilogy+%5BComplete%5D+by+Orson+Scott+Card+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e98996f061f307b15df6f50feab69c00550be84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,152,153,111,6,31,48,123,21,223,111,80,254,171,105,192,5,80,190,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
