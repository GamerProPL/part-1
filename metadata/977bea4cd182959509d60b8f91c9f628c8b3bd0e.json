They were one of the most controversial bands of their time, due mostly to Morrison&amp;#039;s cryptic lyrics and unpredictable stage persona. Since the band&amp;#039;s dissolution in the early 1970s - and especially since Morrison&amp;#039;s death in 1971 - interest in the Doors&amp;#039; music has remained high, at times even surpassing that which the band enjoyed during its own lifetime.[citation needed] The Doors have sold over 50 million albums worldwide.\n\nThe Doors? 40th anniversary celebration reaches a fever pitch as Rhino celebrates one of rock?s most daring and influential bands with two Very Best Of collections as well as reissues of all of the band?s studio albums. Each release boasts brand new mixes supervised by The Doors and Bruce Botnick, the band?s original engineer and producer.\n\nTHE VERY BEST OF THE DOORS (single disc) keeps its eyes on the road and its hands upon the wheel as it launches an unforgettable voyage through the band?s esteemed legacy that covers 20 essential tracks including ?Break On Through,? ?Light My Fire,? ?Hello I Love You,? ?Touch Me,? ?Alabama Song,? ?The End? and more. \n\n\nAudio CD (26 Mar 2007) \nNumber of Discs: 1 \nFormat: Enhanced \nLabel: Rhino \n\nTrack Listings \n1.
