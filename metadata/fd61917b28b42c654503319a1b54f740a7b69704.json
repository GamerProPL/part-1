The combined talents of DJs Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter, the pair's first projects together included Darling, a voiceless indie cover band; their current recording name derives from a review in U.K. music weekly Melody Maker of a compilation tape Darling were featured on, released by Krautrock revivalists Stereolab (their lo-fi D.I.Y. cover of a Beach Boys song was derided as 'daft punk'). Subsequently ditching the almost inevitable creative cul-de-sac of rock for the more appealing rush of the dancefloor, the pair released their debut single, 'The New Wave,' in 1993 on the celebrated Soma label. Instantly hailed by the dance music press as the work of a new breed of house innovators, the single was followed by 'Da Funk,' the band's first true hit (the record sold 30,000 copies worldwide and saw thorough rinsings by everyone from Kris Needs to the Chemical Brothers).\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Around The World\n02.One More Time\n03.Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\n04.Burnin'\n05.Revolution 909\n06.Superheroes\n07.High Life\n08.High Fidelity\n09.Crescendoll\n10.Phoenix\n11.Digital Love\n12.Da Funk\n13.Fresh\n14.Make Love\n15.Face To Face\n16.Something About Us\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Ouverture\n02.Robot Rock\n03.Aerodynamic\n04.Human After All\n05.Technologic\n06.Steam Machine\n07.The Brainwasher\n08.Rock'N' Roll\n09.Rollin' &amp; Scratchin'\n10.Alive\n11.Tehnologic (Vitalic Remix)\n12.Short Circuit\n13.Oh Yeah\n14.Television Rules The Nation\n15.The Prime Time Of Your Life\n16.Emotion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It!****\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd61917b28b42c654503319a1b54f740a7b69704","amp;dn":"+Daft+Punk+-+Greatest+Hits+2CD+%282008%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd61917b28b42c654503319a1b54f740a7b69704","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,97,145,123,40,180,44,101,69,3,49,154,27,84,247,64,167,182,151,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
