Maxwell) Retail [Itzy]\nTitle: How Successful People Lead: Taking Your Influence to the Next Level\nAuthor: John C. Maxwell\nPublisher: Center Street; 1 edition (May 21, 2013)\nFormats: Retail epub, converted azw3, lit, and mobi\nGenres: Non-fiction, self-help\n\nIn this perfectly compact read, #1 New York Times bestselling author John C. Maxwell explains how true leadership works. It is not generated by your title. In fact, being named to a position is the lowest of the five levels every effective leader achieves. To be more than a boss people are required to follow, you must master the ability to inspire and invest in people. You need to build a team that produces not only results, but also future leaders. By combining the advice contained in these pages with skill and dedication, you can reach the pinnacle of leadership-where your influence extends beyond your immediate reach for the benefit of others. \n\nDerived from material previously published in the Wall Street Journal bestseller The 5 Levels of Leadership.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ad6a44457bf3cf7874e8546b9b038e050751cb1","amp;dn":"How+Successful+People+Lead+%28John+C.+Maxwell%29+Retail+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ad6a44457bf3cf7874e8546b9b038e050751cb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,214,164,68,87,191,60,247,135,78,133,70,185,176,56,224,80,117,28,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
