When she investigates, she is faced with a supernatural horror \r\nmore frightening than she could ever imagine. Within this house, a chain of \r\nterror has been set in motion resulting from a terrifying evil that was born \r\nyears before. As more people die, Karen is pulled into the cycle of horror \r\nand learns the secret of the vengeful curse that has taken root in this \r\nhouse.
