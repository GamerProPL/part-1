He's quite rightly worried that the racial difference would make an already taboo relationship even worse.\n\nSpike Lee made &quot;Jungle Fever&quot; in the era when he also made masterpieces like &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; and &quot;Malcolm X&quot;. I will admit that the subject matter here is nothing that we haven't seen many times (an interracial love story), but Lee knows how to do without getting idiotic or manipulating emotions. In this case, African-American Flipper Purify (Wesley Snipes) has an affair with Italian-American co-worker Angela Tucci (Annabella Sciorra), thereby setting off a racially charged chain reaction.\n\nDirected by Spike Lee\n\nWesley Snipes ...
