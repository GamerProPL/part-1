From the birth of a galaxy to the moment that Morpheus is captured, THE SANDMAN: OVERTURE will feature cameo appearances by fan-favorite characters such as The Corinthian, Merv Pumpkinhead and, of course, the Dream King's siblings: Death, Desire, Despair, Delirium, Destruction and Destiny.\n\n&quot;People have often asked me what happened to Morpheus to make it possible for him to be captured in THE SANDMAN #1,&quot; Gaiman said. &quot;And now they get to find out. And finding out, they get to learn secrets of the Endless that I've kept to myself for 25 years. Family secrets. And I should warn you: one of the Endless dies on page five.&quot;\n\nThe first issue of this 6-issue, bimonthly miniseries features a stunning double-page interior foldout.\n\nThis issue is also offered as a combo pack edition with a redemption code for a digital download of this issue.\n\nCover A by J.H.

I was about 12 years old when I first read &quot;A Season of Mists&quot;... there aren't many comics (or books) about which you can truly say, &quot;Hey, that changed my childhood.&quot; But Neil's Sandman is one. Enjoy! (I'm fairly certain that seeders won't be a problem for this.)  --STF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a86393ef0aee7697be41c7566e508499a9906852","amp;dn":"THE+SANDMAN+-+OVERTURE+01+%28of+06%29+%282013%29+%283+covers%29+%28VERTIGO%29+%28d","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a86393ef0aee7697be41c7566e508499a9906852","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,99,147,239,10,238,118,151,190,65,199,86,110,80,132,153,169,144,104,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
