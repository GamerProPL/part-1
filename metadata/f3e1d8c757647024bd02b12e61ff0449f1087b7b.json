In early years they shared their council flat with 'Grandad' (until the death of actor 'Lennard Pierce') later to be replaced by 'Uncle Albert', a WWII Navy veteran with an anecdote for any occasion. Del and Rodney are best described as lovable and harmless black market traders; they buy and (try to) sell almost anything and many an episode is based around some faulty/stolen stock bought by Del. As with other comedies from writer John Sullivan, the humour is devilishly engineered so as not to telegraph the jokes before the punchlines and there's always a strong cast of support characters. The series has won countless awards and ratings battles.\n\nFormat: MKV\nVideo Codec: H.264\nAudio Codec: AC3\nVideo: MPEG4/ISO/AVC, 4:3 and 16:9, 720x576, 25 fps\nAudio: English: 2.0, 48kHz, AC3, 160kbps\n\nSeries 1-7:\n\nS01 - E01 - Big Brother\nS01 - E02 - Go West Young Man\nS01 - E03 - Cash And Curry\nS01 - E04 - The Second Time Around\nS01 - E05 - A Slow Bus To Chingford\nS01 - E06 - The Russians Are Coming\nS02 - E01 - The Long Legs Of The Law\nS02 - E02 - Ashes To Ashes\nS02 - E03 - A Losing Streak\nS02 - E04 - No Greater Love\nS02 - E05 - The Yellow Peril\nS02 - E06 - It Never Rains...\nS02 - E07 - A Touch Of Glass\nS03 - E01 - Homesick\nS03 - E02 - Healthy Competition\nS03 - E03 - Friday The 14th\nS03 - E04 - Yesterday Never Comes\nS03 - E05 - May The Force Be With You\nS03 - E06 - Wanted\nS03 - E07 - Who's A Pretty Boy\nS04 - E01 - Happy Returns\nS04 - E02 - Strained Relations\nS04 - E03 - Hole In One\nS04 - E04 - It's Only Rock And Roll\nS04 - E05 - Sleeping Dogs Lie\nS04 - E06 - Watching The Girls Go By\nS04 - E07 - As One Door Closes\nS05 - E01 - From Prussia With Love\nS05 - E02 - The Miracle Of Peckham\nS05 - E03 - The Longest Night\nS05 - E04 - Tea For Three\nS05 - E05 - Video Nasty\nS05 - E06 - Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\nS06 - E01 - Yuppy Love\nS06 - E02 - Danger UXD\nS06 - E03 - Chain Gang\nS06 - E04 - The Unlucky Winner Is...\nS06 - E05 - Sickness And Wealth\nS06 - E06 - Little Problems\nS07 - E01 - The Sky's The Limit\nS07 - E02 - The Chance Of A Lunchtime\nS07 - E03 - Stage Fright\nS07 - E04 - The Class Of '62\nS07 - E05 - He Ain't Heavy, He's My Uncle\nS07 - E06 - Three Men, A Woman And A Baby\n\nChristmas Specials:\n\n1981 - Christmas Crackers\n1982 - Diamonds Are For Heather\n1983 - Thicker Than Water\n1985 - To Hull And Back\n1986 - A Royal Flush\n1987 - The Frog's Legacy\n1988 - Dates\n1989 - The Jolly Boys' Outing\n1990 - Rodney Come Home\n1991 - Miami Twice\n1992 - Mother Nature's Son\n1993 - Fatal Extraction\n1996 - Heroes And Villains\n1996 - Modern Men\n1996 - Time On Our Hands\n2001 - If They Could See Us Now\n2002 - Strangers On The Shore\n2003 - Sleepless In Peckham","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3e1d8c757647024bd02b12e61ff0449f1087b7b","amp;dn":"Only+Fools+And+Horses+-+The+Complete+Collection+%281981-2003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3e1d8c757647024bd02b12e61ff0449f1087b7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,225,216,199,87,100,112,36,189,2,177,46,97,255,4,73,241,8,123,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
