The most powerful web design software we've ever made.\n\nWebPlus X8 has so many new features to give you more power and control over your websites than ever before. Experience our best ever website designer today, we know you'll love it!\n\nStunning websites, stunning images\nImages speak more than a thousand words, so we've made it even easier to add life to your website in WebPlus X8. Galleries are more flexible, and you now have more controls than ever before. Tell your story through a sequence of images by organising photos by the time they were taken, so that they display in the correct order. Creating a masterpiece takes time, but creating an amazing website, with stunning galleries only takes a few clicks in WebPlus!\n\n- Add extra security to your work with the new Watermarking feature. Imprint your own digital mark onto every image that you display on the web by adding semi-transparent text and logos to photos, with full control over position, size, colour, plus so much more. \n- Your customers will experience a whole new way of interacting with photos as the new magnifier allows you to showcase your products and images in greater detail. Through the magnifier, visitors can zoom and pan around to see your images at their highest resolution.\n- It's now even easier for people to share your amazing imagery with the world too. A new rollover Pinterest button can be applied to images so that your art, crafts and photography can be shared in just one click! \n\n\n\nYour web forms, your style\nIt's so important to interact with your customers, so we've made it easier with even more readymade forms to fit your company's needs. Choose from a variety of pre-made themes, including feedback forms, contact us and sign up forms, which you can then personalise using built-in options, and by using your very own background colours.\n\nIn one simple form, you can open your business up to instant feedback, while still maintaining an air of privacy and professionalism that a simple email us link can't do. You'll capture more responses with no coding necessary. It's really that easy.\n\nSmart objects that work for you\nWhether you are an expert, novice or somewhere in between, you want your web tools to be as intuitive as possible. So, to help with this, the Smart Objects in WebPlus have been re-engineered to suit your needs.\n\nCreate and manage a range of powerful and popular web features for free, such as forums, blogs, accommodation booker, and much more, all with just one log-in. Smart Objects can now be stored more easily too, and then re-used for other sites, as well as used multiple times within one site with a variety of settings. You'll also enjoy a more effective site search that allows visitors to search blogs, regular content and smart objects, to find exactly what they need fast.\n\nMake an impact with the new Slider Studio\nMaking beautiful websites is so easy with the new Slider Studio. Set slider behaviour, control interactivity, and add, remove and fully design panels all in one place. Every slider can be easily customised to fit your website design, and your needs. The dedicated Slider Studio makes adding that visual impact so easy.\n\nSmoother, sleeker, with more customisation\nCreate beautiful, interactive websites by adding a whole host of sleek effects. You'll enjoy having objects fade and animate in and out of view as well as a smooth page scroll when moving up and down your pages for a greater user experience.\n\nThe new Embeddable Fonts List lets you select from a range of attractive, web safe, embeddable fonts that still look as intended without being converted to graphics. This ensures that your website will be picked up in search engines much easier and your website text will look exactly as it is intended to be. And with 40 embeddable fonts included, you can rest assured that fonts are now more accessible and will maintain their appearance on any screen.\n\nFine tune your website graphics with new and improved filter effects such as the cool retro Trail effect, directional feathering, drop shadows and much more.\n\nLive web design assistant\nWebPlus becomes your website design companion; it's there for you every step of the way.
