It contains concert material featuring the Mark IV line-up with Tommy Bolin and David Coverdale. \r\nThe concert was recorded at the Long Beach Arena on 27 February 1976. The album contains four bonus tracks recorded at a Deep Purple concert in Springfield in January, 1976. This concert was originally intended to be used for the King Biscuit broadcast, but imperfections in the recording made the entire show unsuitable for airing and forced the second taping in Long Beach one month later.\r\n\r\nThe album was remastered and re-released with new cover art as Live at Long Beach 1976 on 24 February 2009 by Purple Records.\r\n\r\nYear:\t2016\r\n\r\nStyle:\tHard Rock\r\nCountry:\tUnited Kingdom\r\n\r\nFormat:\t320 mp3\r\nSize:\t286.98 MB\r\n\r\n\t\r\nAdded:\t31/08/2016 \r\nFiles:\t17\r\n\r\nDescription:\t\r\nLength : 02:04:54\r\n\r\nTracks :\r\n\r\nCD1\r\n\r\n01.
