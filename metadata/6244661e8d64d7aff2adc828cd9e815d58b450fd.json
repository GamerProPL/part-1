Until recently, logistics was barely considered in the long-term plans of even major companies, but its strategic role is now recognized and it lies at the heart of long-term plans in almost every business. There are many reasons for this change. Communications and information technology are offering new opportunities; world trade is growing; new markets and sources of materials are opening; competition is forcing operations to adopt new practices and become ever more efficient; relative costs of services and materials are changing; and there is increasing concern for the environment. Add to this the increased emphasis on customer satisfaction, flexible organizations to get their logistics right.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6244661e8d64d7aff2adc828cd9e815d58b450fd","amp;dn":"Global+Logistics%3A+New+Directions+in+Supply+Chain+Management%2C+6th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6244661e8d64d7aff2adc828cd9e815d58b450fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,68,102,30,141,100,215,175,242,173,200,40,205,158,129,93,88,180,80,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
