American brothers Woody and Chuck Dewar, each with a secret, take separate paths to momentous events, one in Washington, the other in the bloody jungles of the Pacific. . . . English student Lloyd Williams discovers in the crucible of the Spanish Civil War that he must fight Communism just as hard as Fascism. . . . Daisy Peshkov, a driven American social climber, cares only for popularity and the fast set, until the war transforms her life, not just once but twice, while her cousin Volodya carves out a position in Soviet intelligence that will affect not only this warÃ¢â‚¬â€but the war to come.\n\nThese characters and many others find their lives inextricably entangled as their experiences illuminate the cataclysms that marked the century. From the drawing rooms of the rich to the blood and smoke of battle, their lives intertwine, propelling the reader into dramas of ever-increasing complexity.\n\nAs always with Ken Follett, the historical background is brilliantly researched and rendered, the action fast-moving, the characters rich in nuance and emotion. With passion and the hand of a master, he brings us into a world we thought we knew, but now will never seem the same again.\n\n\n\n                           Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                           Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n         **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n             Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dd844202889f00aaaaa4389f568c52774171c5c","amp;dn":"Winter+of+the+World+by+Ken+Follett+%28Century+Trilogy+Book+2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dd844202889f00aaaaa4389f568c52774171c5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,216,68,32,40,137,240,10,170,170,67,137,245,104,197,39,116,23,28,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
