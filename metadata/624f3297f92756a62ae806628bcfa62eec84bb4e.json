Brenda is a friend of mine and I have the honor of being able to pass this amazing meditation on to you. She has given permission for me to share this freely with you. The purpose of this simple meditation is to clear and heal your Chakras. \n\nMy personal experience with this meditation has been wonderful. I have listened to it many times. The very first time I used this meditation I felt amazing afterwards. Brenda's voice is so calming and the excercise is so rejuvenating! \n\nWhat are Chakras? \n\nChakras are doorways which serve as non-physical openings or gateways into our energy bodies. It is through these openings that subtle energy forces known as etheric energy, qi, ki, or prana enter and exit both our physical and non-physical bodies. In this energy body there are seven major charkas associated with the physical body. Each chakra serves as an intelligence center for processing energy into the world of physical matter. \n\n\nPLEASE READ: If you enjoyed this meditation, make a donation or purchase BrendaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s CD's on her website! Also included with this download is the intro to her new Meditation, Into the Pause, which you can purchase on her website. At this point she has not made any money from these CD's. Please support this wonderful work! \n\n\nHere is a message from Brenda, the author and producer of this beautiful meditation: \n\nThank you for taking the time to enjoy &quot;Energy Body Revitalization&quot;, a guided meditation to clear the chakras. This was channeled through me last year and after working with it daily, I began to experience significant shifts in various aspects of my life... My experience with this meditation has been profound and I have received many reports of similarly powerful experiences. There is a power in this meditations that is beyond my understanding. I am blessed to share these with you. \n\nAs I removed blockages through the &quot;Energy Body Revitalization&quot; meditation, communication began to clarify. These messages led to a dream of gathering a community of people and resources to help everyone in the world awaken to the beauty of their lives. In support of this we have developed a website at www.wolfwindawakening.com. \n\nHere you will find meditation tools as well as courses, which will help you to; understand your energy body ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ the chakra system; access your subconscious and your intuitive minds; receive and understand messages from your higher consciousness. Please watch for these courses to be offered by Webinar and Podcast in the near future. \n\nIf you have enjoyed this meditation or are curious as to how you can create a more powerful experience for yourself, please visit us and join our community.

A few months after creating &quot;Energy Body Revitalization&quot; I was directed to share the healing benefits of this work. In the following months another meditation, titled &quot;Into The Pause,&quot; was channeled through me. While experiencing &quot;Into the Pause&quot; for the first time, I was informed that this was a meditation for the first chakra and there would be six more to come, one for each of the remaining chakras. &quot;Into The Pause&quot; is available now and I patiently await further guidance for the others. Please go to our website to purchase this brand new Meditation. \n\n\nPLEASE SEED so everyone can reap the benefits of this amazing meditation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:624f3297f92756a62ae806628bcfa62eec84bb4e","amp;dn":"Chakra+Clearing+and+Healing+Meditation+-+SIMPLY+AMAZING%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"624f3297f92756a62ae806628bcfa62eec84bb4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,79,50,151,249,39,86,166,42,232,6,98,139,207,166,46,236,132,187,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
