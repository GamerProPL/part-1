Reading this thrilling, audacious book, you feel the ground shifting beneath your feet. Reason has never had a more passionate advocate.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ian McEwan, author of Atonement and winner of the Man Booker Prize for Amsterdam\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA lively, provocative, and timely new look at one of the deepest problems in the world of ideas. Harris makes a powerful case for a morality that is based on human flourishing and thoroughly enmeshed with science and rationality. It is a tremendously appealing vision, and one that no thinking person can afford to ignore.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Steven Pinker, Professor of Psychology at Harvard University and author of How the Mind Works and The Blank Slate\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBeautifully written as they were (the elegance of his prose is a distilled blend of honesty and clarity) there was little in Sam HarrisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s previous books that couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have been written by any of his fellow ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“horsemenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“new atheism.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ This book is different, though every bit as readable as the other two. I was one of those who had unthinkingly bought into the hectoring myth that science can say nothing about morals. To my surprise, The Moral Landscape has changed all that for me. It should change it for philosophers too. Philosophers of mind have already discovered that they canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t duck the study of neuroscience, and the best of them have raised their game as a result. Sam Harris shows that the same should be true of moral philosophers, and it will turn their world exhilaratingly upside down. As for religion, and the preposterous idea that we need God to be good, nobody wields a sharper bayonet than Sam Harris.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Richard Dawkins, University of Oxford\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œReading Sam Harris is like drinking water from a cool stream on a hot day. He has the rare ability to frame arguments that are not only stimulating, they are downright nourishing, even if you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t always agree with him! In this new book he argues from a philosophical and a neurobiological perspective that science can and should determine morality. His discussions will provoke secular liberals and religious conservatives alike, who jointly argue from different perspectives that there always will be an unbridgeable chasm between merely knowing what is and discerning what should be. As was the case with HarrisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s previous books, readers are bound to come away with previously firm convictions about the world challenged, and a vital new awareness about the nature and value of science and reason in our lives.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Lawrence M.
