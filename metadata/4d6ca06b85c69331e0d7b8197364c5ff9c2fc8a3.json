The Paleo Solution incorporates the latest, cutting edge research from genetics, biochemistry and anthropology to help you look, feel and perform your best. Written by Robb Wolf, a research biochemist who traded in his lab coat and pocket protector for a whistle and a stopwatch to become one of the most sought after strength and conditioning coaches in the world. With Robb's unique perspective as both scientist and coach you will learn how simple nutrition, exercise and lifestyle changes can radically change your appearance and health for the better.\n\nReviews\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nAsserting that &quot;modern life causes diabetes, autoimmunity, cancer, neurodegeneration, and infertility,&quot; the first-time author Wolf, a former student of The Paleo Diet's Lauren Cordain, takes on grains, carbs, vegetarians, misinformation, and other aspects of modern life with a casual, conversational tone (&quot;Keep your poop where it belongs&quot;) that makes even topics like the components of total cholesterol engaging. Wolf's scientific background allows him to fully explain hormones, fats, and the digestive process, and helps him put the fundamentals of evolutionary biology into accessible context. He argues that, in addition to dietary changes, a focus on the quality and duration of sleep and a fitness routine is needed, and photographs accompanied by detailed instructions guide readers through simple exercises. Recognizing the time crunch of modern life, Wolf's program is created to require minimum time and expense. While a grain-free, dairy-free diet may sound difficult to implement, he suggests a commitment-light 30-day trial and provides a four-week menu with simple recipes like Slow Cooker Pork Loin, Chicken Alfredo, and Pizza with a nut-based crust. An extensive list of references, primarily from peer-reviewed journals, lends credence to an intriguing argument. \n\n&quot;I am a firm believer in The Paleo Solution. I maintain a hectic schedule that starts early and finishes late. Filming a television series, maintaining my fitness, and being a mom can be harrowing some days. Since adopting a Paleo way of eating I look and feel better, and I know that I am setting a good example for my daughter.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Eva La Rue, star of 'CSI: Miami'\n\n&quot;I've watched as The Paleo Solution healed people after medical professionals had given up. Whether you're an athlete, or simply uninterested in becoming a health care statisticÃ¢â‚¬â€there are no more excuses! Now you will finally look, feel, and perform as well as your genes will allow. Robb Wolf changed my life, and he's about to change yours too.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Kyle Maynard, author of No Excuses and 2004 ESPY Award winner\n\n&quot;Robb Wolf and The Paleo Solution have changed the way I look at diet and nutrition. He's helped me understand just how critical diet and sleep can be to your overall health and life.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Forrest Griffin, former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion and author of the bestselling Got Fight?\n\n&quot;They say the worth of a book is to be measured by what you can carry away from it. The Paleo Solution's value is far reaching for the knowledge that it offers. Robb has taken a unique approach to health and lifestyle that will help countless people.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€John Welbourn, 10-Year NFL Veteran\n\nThe Paleo Solution Ã¢â‚¬â€œ September 14, 2010\nBook Language: English \nPages: 207\nFile Type: Epub, Pdf, Mobi\nFile Size: 4.54 MB\n\nISBN-13: 978-0982565841","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d6ca06b85c69331e0d7b8197364c5ff9c2fc8a3","amp;dn":"The+Paleo+Solution+by+ROBB+WOLF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d6ca06b85c69331e0d7b8197364c5ff9c2fc8a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,108,160,107,133,198,147,49,224,215,184,25,115,100,197,255,156,47,200,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
