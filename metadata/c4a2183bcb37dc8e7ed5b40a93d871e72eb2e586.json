The story of an alien on an elaborate rescue mission provides the launching pad for Nicolas RoegÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s visual tour de force, a formally adventurous examination of alienation in contemporary life. Rock legend David Bowie, in his acting debut, completely embodies the title role, while Candy Clark, Buck Henry, and Rip Torn turn in pitch-perfect supporting performances. The filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hallucinatory vision was obscured in the American theatrical release, which deleted nearly twenty minutes of crucial scenes and details. The Criterion Collection is proud to present RoegÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s full uncut version, in this exclusive new director approved high definition widescreen transfer.\n\nOn July 6, 1975 filming began. The film's production had been scheduled to last eleven weeks. Throughout the eleven weeks, the film crew ran into some obstacles. One day, Bowie noticed Some gold liquid swimming around in shiny swirls inside the glass of milk he was drinking and for the next two days of production Bowie was sick. On top of that, equipment was malfunctioning and run-ins with locals occurred.\n\nThe film was primarily shot in New Mexico. Filming locations include Albuquerque, White Sands, Artesia, and Fenton Lake.\n\nMedia Info:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\The Man Who Fell To Earth (1976)[DVDRip][Big_dad_e]\\The Man Who Fell To Earth (1976)[DVDRip][Big_dad_e].avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.30 GiB\nDuration                         : 2h 19mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 342 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : DIVX\nCodec ID/Info                    : Project Mayo\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 4\nDuration                         : 2h 19mn\nBit rate                         : 1 200 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nStandard                         : NTSC\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.116\nStream size                      : 1.17 GiB (89%)\nWriting library                  : avc2.0.11.1110\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 2h 19mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 127 MiB (10%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.72 video frame)\nWriting library                  : LAME3.96.1\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.46\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 5096\n\nWindows 5.1.2600 Service Pack 3\nInternet Explorer 8.0.6001.18702\n\n11/11/2010 8:19:45 PM\nmbam-log-2010-11-11 (20-19-45).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 6\nTime elapsed: 10 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
