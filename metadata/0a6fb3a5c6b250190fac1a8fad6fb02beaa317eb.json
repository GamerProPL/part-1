This is the best damn Mass Effect 2 DLC repack ever.\n\n\nAnd if you're thinking &quot;Oh, I already have all DLCs, patches and cracks&quot; - imagine what it's like, to have them all installed by pressing one button. ;)\n\n\n\nMass Effect 2 DLC Pack includes the following DLCs:\n\nAegis Pack\nAlternate Appearance Pack 1\nAlternate Appearance Pack 2\nArc Projector\nArrival\nBlood Dragon Armor\nCerberus Weapon and Armor\nCollectors Weapon and Armor\nEqualizer Pack\nFirepower Pack\nFirewalker\nInferno Armor\nKasumi - Stolen Memory\nLair of the Shadow Broker\nM-29 Incisor Sniper Rifle\nNormandy Crash Site\nOverlord\nRecon Hood\nSentry Interface\nTerminus Weapon and Armor\nUmbra Visor\nZaeed - The Price of Revenge\n\n\n\nBasics:\n\n1) The pack will detect your game path from the registry and will know where to install. NO, I DID NOT include an option to change the path manually, because my DLC crack depends on that registry key too. If you have a crappy Rip with missing registry keys, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m sorry, but thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s your problem. Get a normal version.\n\n\n2) The pack will INSTALL EVERYTHING AUTOMATICALLY. Specifically:\n\nIt will detect your game path from registry, and install DLCs there, then it will install both official patches, then it will crack the DLCs, and then it will copy game crack in game folder. \nSo yes, you just need to press ONE BUTTON. And everything will be done for you. You DONÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢T NEED any cracks, or patches, or anything. All done for you.\n\n\n3) Yes, it includes all the DLCs ever released, from the very first one up to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œArrivalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\n\n4) Yes, you need to have Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 installed in order for the DLC crack to work. At the end of the installation you will be asked if you want to install it. If you already have it, just cancel. If not ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ install. .Net Framework 3.5 is INCLUDED in the package.\n\n\n\nAfter installation, just launch the game as usual, by any of its shortcuts (Desktop/Quick Launch/Start Menu), OR by starting ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRunMassEffect2.exeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ file in Game Folder -&gt; Binaries. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRunMassEffect2.exeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a DLC crack, I have tied it to game launcher.\n\nThe installer script has been updated in this version, if you had any problems before, you will not have them now. And if you STILL do, they are completely the fault of your actions and/or your computer. I have absolutely perfected my automatic installer script, it has no bugs. Been working on it for months now.\n\n\n\nFor those who didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t read anything of the above, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll just brief you in a few words:\nThis is a best repack if all the DLCs, patches and cracks, everything installs with one button. Over.\n\n\nAnd for Jolly Roger's sake, seed the damned thing. :)\n\n\n-illiria","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a6fb3a5c6b250190fac1a8fad6fb02beaa317eb","amp;dn":"Mass+Effect+2+%2AFull%2C+Final%2A+DLC+%26+Patch+Repack+2011+-+illiria","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a6fb3a5c6b250190fac1a8fad6fb02beaa317eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,111,179,165,198,178,80,25,15,172,26,143,173,111,176,43,234,163,23,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
