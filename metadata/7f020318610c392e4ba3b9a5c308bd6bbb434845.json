That is one of the reasons why Live Through This sounds so shockingly different from Pretty on the Inside, but the real reason is Love's desire to compete in the same commercial alternative rock arena as her husband, Kurt Cobain. In fact, many rumors have claimed that Cobain ghostwrote a substantial chunk of the album, and while that's unlikely, there's no denying that his patented stop-start dynamics, bare chords, and punk-pop melodies provide the blueprint for Live Through This. Love adds her signature rage and feminist rhetoric to the formula, but the lyrics that truly resonate are the ones that unintentionally predict Cobain's suicide. For all the raw pain of the lyrics, Live Through This rarely sounds raw because of the shiny production and the carefully considered dynamics. Despite this flaw, the album retains its power because it was one of the few records patterned on Nevermind that gets the formula right, with a set of gripping hooks and melodies that retain their power even if they follow the predictable grunge pattern. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tAlternative\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Violet\n02.Miss World\n03.Plump\n04.Asking For It\n05.Jennifer's Body\n06.Doll Parts\n07.Credit In The Straight World\n08.Softer, Softest\n09.She Walks On Me\n10.I Think That I Would Die\n11.Gutless\n12.Rock Star\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f020318610c392e4ba3b9a5c308bd6bbb434845","amp;dn":"Hole+-+Live+Through+This+%281994%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f020318610c392e4ba3b9a5c308bd6bbb434845","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,2,3,24,97,12,57,46,75,163,185,165,195,8,189,107,187,67,72,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
