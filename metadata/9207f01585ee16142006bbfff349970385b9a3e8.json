You're in luck. The comedian released a brand new album, &quot;WORD: Live at Carnegie Hall,&quot; today as a download on his website. Laughspin first reported the news this morning, and although they first indicated that the album would not be released until tomorrow, &quot;Word&quot; is currently available on louisck.net for $5.\n\nThe comedian received plenty of accolades for his latest one-hour special, &quot;Live at the Beacon Theater,&quot; which he announced, produced, and independently released within about a month last November.
