That's because ReMask is designed on one simple idea: You create the best quality mask with minimal input. By using ReMaskÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intelligent technology, you have the power to quickly and easily extract even the toughest elements hair, foliage, and transparent materials in your photos.\n\nAnyone editing photos must be able to select the exact objects or sections, which is essential to improving your photos. This ability to select objects and cutout backgrounds provides greater flexibility to your post processing workflow - making essential editing tasks like background replacement, selective adjustments, repositioning and multi-layer compositions effortless. \nWith ReMask's powerful and controllable tools you can quickly and easily select any part of your image. Like a pair of digital scissors, ReMask allows you to define the edges of an object and intuitively cut it out - which as a photographer, saves you both time and money.\n\n[b]ReMask 4 Highlights[/b]\n- Color decontamination technology to help solve color bleed issues\n- Better hair extraction technology\n- Refining Toolset for fine-tuning masks and foreground color\n- Ability to handle certain types of transparent objects\n- Color selection brushes for complex objects such as trees and veils\n- Ability to save and load tri-map and masks\n- Auto-create layer and auto-create mask options\n- 2-screen or 4-screen viewing for mask accuracy\n\n[b]OS :[/b] Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 (32-bit and 64-bit)\n\n[b]Homepage:[/b] [url=http://www.topazlabs.com/remask]http://www.topazlabs.com/remask[/url] ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:591790e71dc9976ccc23b55f419e0e374ccf37d1","amp;dn":"Topaz+ReMask+4.0.0+for+Adobe+Photoshop+%5BChingLiu%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"591790e71dc9976ccc23b55f419e0e374ccf37d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,23,144,231,29,201,151,108,204,35,181,95,65,158,14,55,76,207,55,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
