You will know that one of the sure ways to contentment in this life is a small boat, a fair wind, and a new coast to explore.'\r\nDinghy cruising is a wonderful way to experience nature and new coastlines at close quarters and low cost. Sailing where larger boats cannot reach, and sleeping under canvas onboard or ashore, this is boating taken right back to the basics, and all the better for that. This guide, for all aspiring or already-enthusiastic dinghy cruisers, shows how to get started and how to expand your horizons.\r\nThe information and advice is interwoven with wonderfully evocative stories of the author's adventures afloat, from idyllic weeks pottering around secluded rivers and coastlines to hair-raising voyages to remote islands. Illustrated throughout with inspirational colour photos and helpful illustrations, this book shows just why small boats are the perfect passport to remote and beautiful places.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author \nhttp://s15.postimg.org/z65oebd0r/barnes.jpg\r\nRoger Barnes is President of the Dinghy Cruising Association, and lives out his passion year round, exploring beautiful and remote places in his dinghy Avel Dro.
