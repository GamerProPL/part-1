End to world hunger? What's left to do after the publication of Felice Newman's definitive guide to lesbian sex? Drawing on a wide range of published sources as well as her own notoriously graphic questionnaire circulated by e-mail--stunning mild-mannered office workers as it reeled across their computer screens--Newman has compiled an exhaustively thorough how-to guide for practices as exotic as play piercings and as pedestrian as oral sex. Along the way, she offers a primer in sexual politics and lesbian manners at the turn of the century. The S/M hanky code is laid out once and for all. There is even a (brief, happily brief) section on celibacy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e539c9983c92f9b188d2f76d2015dae208f38ab","amp;dn":"The+Whole+Lesbian+Sex+Book+-+A+Passionate+Guide+For+All+Of+Us","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e539c9983c92f9b188d2f76d2015dae208f38ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,83,156,153,131,201,47,155,24,141,47,118,210,1,93,174,32,143,56,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
