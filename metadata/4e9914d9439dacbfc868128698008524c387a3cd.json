The iconoclast hip-hop producer s album includes 12 original tracks with vocal appearances from an impressive cast of collaborators, including Vince Staples, Kelela, Sam Herring (Future Islands), Joe Newman (alt-j) and more. The album also includes his first ever collaboration between A$AP Rocky and Lil B, on the track â€œBe Somebody.â€ Instrumental versions of every track on the album will be made available across all formats which include digital, CD and a special 2 LP set in gatefold packaging. Creative direction and design on â€™32 Levelsâ€™ is by Trevor Jackson, the renowned art director, designer, moving-image maker, producer and Output Recordings label founder.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Clams Casino compiled a set of his favorite beats into the now essential mixtape Instrumentals Vol 1, that he achieved widespread recognition. Rolling Stone called him a â€œvisionary,â€ SPIN described his music as â€œfascinating and ominously exhilaratingâ€ and he was lauded on BBC Radio 1 by legendary producer Brian Eno. He has since developed a formidable resume, having appeared on four top 10 albums (The Weeknd Trilogy, #4 debut, A$AP Rocky Long.Live.A$AP, #1 debut, Schoolboy Q Oxymoron, #1 debut and Mac Miller Blue Slide Park, #1 debut). Clams has also contributed production on many critically acclaimed artistsâ€™ albums, including FKA Twigs, Vince Staples, A$AP Ferg, and ScHoolboy Q.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01. Level 1 1:44\r\n02.
