Tago Mago is that rarity of the early '70s, a double album without a wasted note, ranging from sweetly gentle float to full-on monster grooves, including the overwhelming &quot;Halleluwah&quot;, possibly the only 18-minute song that would be too short at twice its length.\nTago Mago has been described as Can's most extreme record in terms of sound and structure. It finds Can changing to a jazzier and more experimental sound. On the album, they took sonic inspiration from sources as diverse as jazz musicians such as Miles Davis and from electronic avant-garde music.  Tago Mago is divided into two parts, the first of which is more conventional and structured and the second more experimental and free-form. \n\n\n\n\nNote: Krautrock is a German avant-garde / experimental rock movement that emerged at the end of the 1960's. The term krautrock was originally a humorous one coined by the UK music press (such as New Musical Express and Melody Maker), where &quot;krautrock&quot; found an early and enthusiastic underground following. \nJulian Cope, in his book Krautrocksampler, says &quot;Krautrock is a subjective British phenomenon,&quot; based on the way the music was received in the UK rather than on the actual West German music scene out of which it grew.  The term is also a problematic category due to the considerable differences between the artists so labelled.\nKey artists associated with the tag include Can, Amon DÃƒÂ¼ÃƒÂ¼l II, Ash Ra Tempel, Faust, Popol Vuh, Cluster, Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, Neu!, and Kraftwerk.\n \n\n \n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n\n \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f47ee0dba152507dcc65cba207b4cb063c50e94d","amp;dn":"CAN+-+Tago+Mago+1971+%2F+2004+Remaster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f47ee0dba152507dcc65cba207b4cb063c50e94d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,126,224,219,161,82,80,125,204,101,203,162,7,180,203,6,60,80,233,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
