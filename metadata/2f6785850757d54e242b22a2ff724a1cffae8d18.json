SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS DOWN !\n\nCall of Duty: World at War is a first-person shooter video game developed by Treyarch and published by Activision for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Wii, Xbox 360, Nintendo DS, and PlayStation 2. It is the fifth installment in the main Call of Duty series. The game is set in the Pacific theater and Eastern front of World War II. The game shipped in North America on November 11, 2008, in Australia on November 12, 2008, and in Europe on November 14, 2008.\n\nThe story focuses on the final battles of World War II in the Pacific and Eastern Europe involving the United States, the Empire of Japan, the Soviet Union, and Nazi Germany. It is told from the perspectives of a Marine Raider and a Red Army soldier, and is based on several historical battles, including the Makin Island raid, the Battle of Peleliu, and the Battle of Berlin. The multiplayer portion of the game contains various game modes, and contains a leveling system that allows the player to unlock additional weapons and rewards as they progress, which was originally implemented in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. A new feature to the Call of Duty series is the co-op mode, which can support up to four players online and two offline.\n\n\n\nThe game&amp;#039;s return to World War II-era warfare reintroduces weapons and technology that have been seen in other games in the Call of Duty franchise, including the Thompson submachine gun, flamethrowers, the Mosin-Nagant rifle, and the Panzerschreck anti-tank rocket. The player gains access to these over the course of the game, but may only carry up to two weapons in addition to grenades. Weapons from fallen foes can be picked up to replace weapons in a player&amp;#039;s arsenal. Players can also find weapons with additional attachments, including guns equipped with rifle grenades and telescopic sights.\n\n\n\nSystem Requirement:\n CPU: AMD 64 3200+ / Intel Pentium 4 3.0GHz + \nMemory: 512MB (XP) or 1GB (Vista) 2 recommended on vista. 1gb recommended on XP.\n HD Space: 8GB \nGraphic Card: Nvidia 6600GT/ATI Radeon 1600XT or higher (Shader 3.0 or better) with 256MB memory.\n\n\nThanks for downloading and seeding.
