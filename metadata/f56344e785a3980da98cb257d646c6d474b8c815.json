W. Murnau\n\nNOTE:This is the Kino DVD version of Nosferatu, quite simply the best version of the movie available.\n\nPLOT:The story is narrated from the diary of Johann Cavallius, historian of the city of Bremen, who is wondering if it was the Nosferatu who brought the plague to Bremen in 1838.\n\nNewlyweds Hutter [Gustav von Wangenheim] and Ellen [Greta Schroeder] are saddened when Hutter is sent to Transylvania by Hutter's employer Knock [Alexander Grannach] to arrange for Count Orlok's [Max Schreck] purchase of a house across the street from the Hutters' house in Bremen. Hutter travels to Transylvania where he stays with the Count, is bitten by the Count, and eventually escapes from the castle but not before seeing the Count depart on a cart loaded with coffins. While Hutter recuperates in a hospital after succeeding in his escape, the Count moves into the house across from the Hutters'. The rise in deaths is accredited to a plague thought to have arrived with the Demeter. The &quot;Book of the Vampires&quot; tells Ellen what she must do to end the vampire.\n\nThe Count meets his doom when Ellen manages to keep him until after cock crow. Best scene is the vampire rising from Ellen's neck after realizing the cock has crowed. As the sun slowly advances on the houses across the street (visible from the window), the Nosferatu attempts to escape. In doing so, he passes the window and is trapped by the sunlight. He 'vaporizes' into a puff of fire on the carpet.\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0013442/synopsis\nWIKI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosferatu\n\n\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 700 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 34mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 038 Kbps\nWriting application              : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library                  : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Custom\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 34mn\nBit rate                         : 901 Kbps\nWidth                            : 560 pixels\nHeight                           : 416 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nResolution                       : 8 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.129\nStream size                      : 608 MiB (87%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nFormat_Settings_ModeExtension    : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 34mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 86.2 MiB (12%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 67 ms (2.00 video frames)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 504 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98r\nEncoding settings                : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 -b 128\nLanguage                         : English\n\nPlease don't expect to get the movie in a few minutes, I only have limited bandwidth.
