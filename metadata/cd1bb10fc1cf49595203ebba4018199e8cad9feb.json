To be exact, the monster world depends on our \r\nchildren's screams: It is their energy that makes light bulbs glow and \r\ncars drive. Big companies like Monsters, Inc. collect the scream energy, \r\nand many monsters work there in shifts. In these times, it is getting \r\nharder and harder to shock the kids properly, since they're so spoiled \r\nby television, so that there's an energy shortage in the monster world. \r\nSulley, the number one frightener, one day accidentally lets a human \r\nchild into the monster world. Since kids are supposed to be poisonous \r\nand carry loads of diseases, pandemonium ensues. After Mike and Sulley \r\ndiscover that the girl they named Boo actually seems quite harmless, \r\nthey decide to bring her back through her door into her room. But \r\nBoo's presence is more than just a mere accident. Now, Mike and \r\nSulley have to face an enemy within their own ranks.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Billy Crystal.\r\n=&gt;-Mary Gibbs.\r\n=&gt;-John Goodman.\r\n\r\nDirectors.\r\n=&gt;-Pete Docter.\r\n=&gt;-David Silverman.\r\n=&gt;-Lee Unkrich.\r\n\r\nMonsters University 2013.\r\nWhen Mike Wazowski is young, he visits the Monsters University in a tour \r\nof his primary school. A senior student gives his hat to Mike and he plans \r\nto become a scary monster. Years later, Mike joins the Monsters University \r\nand on the arrival, he receives a flier of the Scare Games that will take \r\nplace soon in the campus. Mike also befriends his roommate Randall. When \r\nthe lazy student James P. &quot;Sully&quot; Sullivan, who belongs to a family of \r\nfamous &quot;scarers&quot;, breaks in his room, they start a competition in class. \r\nTheir dispute ends when they accidentally break the pride and of joy of \r\nDean Abigail Hardscrabble, a cylinder with her greatest achievement - a \r\npowerful scream of a boy. They both are expelled from the scare classes \r\nby Hardscramble who says that Sully is lazy and Mike is not scary, and \r\nthey become enemies. When Mike recalls the Scare Games, he sees his only \r\nchance to return to the scare course. He makes the application to \r\nparticipate, but he learns that he needs a fraternity. Mike joins the \r\nOozma Kappa that is the only fraternity available with four losers, but \r\nhe is informed that the fraternity needs to have six members. Sully \r\noffers to complete the team and Mike has no other alternative but accept \r\nSully in his team. Then he bets with Hardscramble that if he wins the \r\ngames, she will accept them in the scare classes. Soon the game begins.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Billy Crystal.\r\n=&gt;-Steve Buscemi.\r\n=&gt;-John Goodman.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Dan Scanlon.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Animation : Adventure : Comedy.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2001 : 2013.\r\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.08 GiB : 1.22 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 681 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 32mn : 1h 43mn.\r\n=&gt;-Chapters...................: 32 Named.\r\n=&gt;-Monsters Inc 2001..........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0198781/\r\n=&gt;-Monsters Inc 2001..........: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/monsters_inc/\r\n=&gt;-Monsters Inc 2001..........: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/monsters-inc/\r\n=&gt;-Monsters University 2013...: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1453405/\r\n=&gt;-Monsters University 2013...: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/monsters_university/\r\n=&gt;-Monsters University 2013...: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/monsters-university/\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 1.85:1 : 16:9.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 720 : 1280 x 688.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 564 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 229 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd1bb10fc1cf49595203ebba4018199e8cad9feb","amp;dn":"Monsters+Inc+and+University+-+Animation+Adventure+2001+2013+Eng+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd1bb10fc1cf49595203ebba4018199e8cad9feb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,27,177,15,193,207,73,89,82,3,235,186,64,24,25,158,140,173,159,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
