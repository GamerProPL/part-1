The group was formed in Sheffield, England, in 1977 by synth players Martyn Ware and Ian Marsh, who'd previously teamed as the duo Dead Daughters; following a brief tenure as the Future, they rechristened themselves the Human League after enlisting vocalist Philip Oakey. The trio soon recorded a demo, and played their first live dates; they soon tapped Adrian Wright as their &quot;Director of Visuals,&quot; and his slide shows quickly became a key component of their performances. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop\t\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Don't You Want Me\n02.Love Action (I Believe In Love)\n03.Mirror Man\n04.Tell Me When\n05.Stay With Me Tonight\n06.Open Your Heart\n07.(Keep Feeling) Fascination\n08.The Sound Of The Crowd\n09.Being Boiled\n10.The Lebanon\n11.Love Is All That Matters\n12.Louise\n13.Life On Your Own\n14.Together In Electric Dreams\n15.Human\n16.Don't You Want Me (Snap 7&quot; Remix)\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8eeac5ff517551980bdbe28a9ce8eea722518b8c","amp;dn":"The+Human+League+-+Greatest+Hits+%281995%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8eeac5ff517551980bdbe28a9ce8eea722518b8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,234,197,255,81,117,81,152,11,219,226,138,156,232,238,167,34,81,139,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
