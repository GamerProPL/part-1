SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a talented young chef, she runs a successful restaurant, and she has big plans to open an even better one. Then, all at once, progress on the new location bogs down, her charming ex-boyfriend pops up, her fling with another chef goes sour, and her best waitress gets badly hurt. And just like that, KatieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life goes from pretty good to not so much. What she needs is a second chance. Everybody deserves one, after allÃ¢â‚¬â€but they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come easy. Luckily for Katie, a mysterious girl appears in the middle of the night with simple instructions for a do-it-yourself do-over:\n\n1. Write your mistake\n2. Ingest one mushroom\n3. Go to sleep\n4. Wake anew\n\nAnd just like that, all the bad stuff never happened, and Katie is given another chance to get things right. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also got a dresser drawer full of magical mushroomsÃ¢â‚¬â€and an irresistible urge to make her life not just good, but perfect. Too bad itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s against the rules. But Katie doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care about the rulesÃ¢â‚¬â€and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about to discover the unintended consequences of the best intentions.\n\nFrom the mind and pen behind the acclaimed Scott Pilgrim series comes a madcap new tale of existential angst, everyday obstacles, young love, and ancient spirits thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sharp-witted and tenderhearted, whimsical and wise.&quot;\n\nI wasn't sure how to credit this and it is NOT a proper 2048px scan - it was manually done by a person named Georgy Biryukov as far as I can tell but his screenname is burningheart, so I went with that. Still, a nice copy and digital too. Thanks to him for his efforts; please seed and enjoy. \n\nPlease visit and support my Suprbay release thread here, I would appreciate it:       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-VikTSlick-s-Comics-Releases&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-VikTSlick-s-Comics-Releases&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26508b235bb538ca6e97a5bb2ef0116b5542cacb","amp;dn":"Seconds+by+Bryan+Lee+O%27Malley+%282014%29+%28digital%29+%5BBURNINGHEART%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26508b235bb538ca6e97a5bb2ef0116b5542cacb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,80,139,35,91,181,56,202,110,151,165,187,46,240,17,107,85,66,202,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
