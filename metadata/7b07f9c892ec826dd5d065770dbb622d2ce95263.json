Theme Park World was developed by Bullfrog Productions and released by Electronic Arts in 1999[1]. Initially developed for Windows, it was later ported to PlayStation and PlayStation 2, as well for Macintosh computers[2]. The Mac version was published by Feral Interactive.\n\nAlthough there's no connection with Maxis's Sim titles, both Maxis and Bullfrog are owned by Electronic Arts, so it is still seen as part of the Sim series. It was followed by Theme Park Inc (also known as Sim Coaster) in 2000/2001.\n\nUsing golden tickets, users were able to buy new rides, attractions, shops and features (some of which were a bit controversial) on the game's website. Most of the staff the user can hire in Theme Park World are named after people who worked on the game.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b07f9c892ec826dd5d065770dbb622d2ce95263","amp;dn":"Sim+Them+Park%2FTheme+Park+World+%28PC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b07f9c892ec826dd5d065770dbb622d2ce95263","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,7,249,200,146,236,130,109,213,208,101,119,13,187,98,45,44,233,82,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
