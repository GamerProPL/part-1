In 2004, under At One Records, they released their first album, Exhaustion, Salt Water, and Everything in Between. Some time after the albums release the band underwent a change in line up, with only vocalist front man Jason Aalon Butler remaining today from the bands original lineup.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5727537634fb9050f21cb8c2bee7f7d91604be15","amp;dn":"Letlive+-+Fake+History+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5727537634fb9050f21cb8c2bee7f7d91604be15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,39,83,118,52,251,144,80,242,28,184,194,190,231,247,217,22,4,190,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
