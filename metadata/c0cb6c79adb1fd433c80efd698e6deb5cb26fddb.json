The heart of this development tools suite is the CCS intelligent code optimizing C compiler which frees developers to concentrate on design functionality instead of having to become an MCU architecture expert.\nCCS C Compiler screenshot\n\n    Maximize code reuse by easily porting from one MCU to another. Devices Supported\n    Minimize lines of new code with CCS provided peripheral drivers, built-in functions and standard C operators\n    Built-in functions are specific to PICÃ‚Â® MCU registers, allowing access to hardware features directly from C\n\nReady to run examples and tested peripheral drivers allow developers to quickly start their project. To learn more about our C compiler, check out the compiler details and view the CCS Compiler Quick Start Video Tutorial.\n\nThe C Aware IDE is an ideal environment to create C source code with integrated built-in functions, analyze it's performance, and debug the compiled code in real-time while running on Microchip devices.\n\nKey C Aware IDE Components:\n\n    Project manager\n    C-Aware text editor\n    Compilation control to completely or partially build projects\n    Utilities for file comparison, numeric conversion, disassembly, parametric device selection and more\n    C-Source code level in-circuit debugger\n    Output file viewers for list files, symbol maps, call trees, etc.\n    Documentation creation tools\n\nThe CCS C Compiler has complementary development tools that work seamlessly with the compiler. Program, debug, and data stream from one environment that may be used for development and production.\nC Compiler Products\n\nFlexible product configurations enable you to purchase only what you need now, and later add on additional family support and product features as you need them. Unlike compilers from other tool providers, all CCS compiler products offer the same high level of code optimization. The C Aware IDE is available in three levels of family support and individual command line compilers are available for each Microchip family.\n\nCCS also offers software maintenance to keep your software running at peak performance, software upgrades and additional user licenses.
