Update your Graphic Drivers. \n\nNOTE: I have only tested this game in Windows 7 Ultimate (64-bit) and I\nremember that I was not able to run this game(Original copy) when I had\nWindows XP installed in my PC. (Maybe because my drivers were not\nup to date). So I doubt whether it will work for Windows XP users or not.\n\nIf you have any problem with setup give as much details as you can about the problem.\n\nplease seed and leave comments after downloading...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57e7e8115f53ec4a0090f0e6996f6756758cd4b1","amp;dn":"%5BNFS+C%5D+Need+For+Speed%3A+Carbon+%282006%29+%5BFull-RiP%5D+%5BAVeRAnTeD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57e7e8115f53ec4a0090f0e6996f6756758cd4b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,231,232,17,95,83,236,74,0,144,240,230,153,111,103,86,117,140,212,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
