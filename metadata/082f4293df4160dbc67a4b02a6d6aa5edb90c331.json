I suggest using falling blocks: vanilla else some of your world caves will collapse and that kind of sucks, but it's up to preference, experiment to find your setting\n\nnote: if it gets stuck at converting world while creating world, end task and start over\nnote: check out your new hotkeys ingame, and checkout each of the mod features on the internet","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:082f4293df4160dbc67a4b02a6d6aa5edb90c331","amp;dn":"minecraft+1.6.2+with+20%2B+mods%2C+lots+of+shaders+and+realistic+tex","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"082f4293df4160dbc67a4b02a6d6aa5edb90c331","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,47,66,147,223,65,96,219,198,122,75,2,166,214,170,94,219,144,195,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
