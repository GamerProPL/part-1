Now, in BETWEEN BREATHS, Vargas discusses her accounts of growing up with anxiety-which began suddenly at the age of six when her father served in Vietnam-and how she dealt with this anxiety as she came of age, to her eventually turning to alcohol for relief. She tells of how she found herself living in denial, about the extent of her addiction and keeping her dependency a secret for so long. She addresses her time in rehab, her first year of sobriety, and the guilt she felt as a working mother who had never found the right balance.\r\n\r\nHonest and hopeful, BETWEEN BREATHS is an inspiring read","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5713ba024c19b04c4aea4c42a65586f862e104f","amp;dn":"Between+Breaths%3A+A+Memoir+%282016%29+by+Elizabeth+Vargas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5713ba024c19b04c4aea4c42a65586f862e104f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,113,59,160,36,193,155,4,196,174,164,196,42,101,88,111,134,46,16,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
