Being founded with all Christian members and maintaining a theme that represents their religion, the group played their first show in 2005 with a fill-in bassist and only one guitarist. Rhythm guitarist Jeremy Depoyster and bassist Andy Trick joined the band soon afterward. They continued playing at local areas in Dayton before recording their demo later in the year which was titled Patterns of a Horizon.\n\nIn Christ,\nTorrentTracts - October 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8604b20e72f05918369a0c6e926c5a7c6cab4a8d","amp;dn":"The+Devil+Wears+Prada+Discography+2005-2013+%2815+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8604b20e72f05918369a0c6e926c5a7c6cab4a8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,4,178,14,114,240,89,24,54,154,12,110,146,108,90,124,108,171,74,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
