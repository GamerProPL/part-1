ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the perfect solution for the millions of readers who love all things Freakonomics. Surprising and erudite, eloquent and witty, When to Rob a Bank demonstrates the brilliance that has made the Freakonomics guys an international sensation, with more than 7 million books sold in 40 languages, and 150 million downloads of their Freakonomics Radio podcast.\n\n When Freakonomics was first published, the authors started a blogÃ¢â‚¬â€and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve kept it up. The writing is more casual, more personal, even more outlandish than in their books. In When to Rob a Bank, they ask a host of typically off-center questions: Why donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t flight attendants get tipped? If you were a terrorist, how would you attack? And why does KFC always run out of fried chicken?\n\n Over the past decade, Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner have published more than 8,000 blog posts on Freakonomics.com. Many of them, they freely admit, were rubbish. But now theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve gone through and picked the best of the best. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover what people lie about, and why; the best way to cut gun deaths; why it might be time for a sex tax; and, yes, when to rob a bank. (Short answer: never; the ROI is terrible.) YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also learn a great deal about Levitt and DubnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own quirks and passions, from gambling and golf to backgammon and the abolition of the penny","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f1f5a71f0afb5618baeed909136ec502979e29e","amp;dn":"When+to+Rob+a+Bank%3A+And+131+More+Warped+Suggestions+%282015%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f1f5a71f0afb5618baeed909136ec502979e29e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,31,90,113,240,175,181,97,139,174,237,144,145,54,236,80,41,121,226,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
