Director Rainier, Producer Bingbong and Production \nAssistant Jocelyn are well-to-do, well-educated film school graduates who are dead set on \nmaking an Oscar worthy film. They believe they have a winning script, the energy and the \ndrive to make their dreams come true. Like most filmmakers they know, they have devised a \nscreenplay that will show the real essence of our culture: poverty. In the course of one day, \nthey brainstorm and exhaust all possible treatment of their \nproject: the story of Mila (Eugene Domingo), a mother from the slums, \nwho out of desperation to survive, has sold her child to a pedophile. \nAs they discuss the possible executions of the story, the movie-within-a-movie gets \nreborn in JocelynÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s imagination several times. As a gritty no frills neo-realist film, \nas a glossy musical, as an over-the-top melodrama and as a docu drama using non-actors. \nFor their last task of the day, they visit the dumpsite for the first time. \nAs filmmakers gunning for authenticity, they get excited with the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½beautyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of the squalor \naround them. Soon enough, they are faced with reality as they come face to face with the real \neffects of their chosen subject. Babae sa Septic Tank is a comedy about misguided ambitions, \nthe art of making art and the romanticization of poverty. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pix2links.com/images/30749164489978759311.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pix2links.com/images/30749164489978759311.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de7ce2c92711dcefa4ad2c898e52413c00c1a958","amp;dn":"Babae+Sa+Septik+Tank+%5B2011%5D+CAMrip+XviD+%5BPinoy+Tagalog%5D+BPN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de7ce2c92711dcefa4ad2c898e52413c00c1a958","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,124,226,201,39,17,220,239,164,173,44,137,142,82,65,60,0,193,169,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
