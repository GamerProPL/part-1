There is nothing complicated in the Eat Stop Eat method. It is simple a book that shows you how to live your life the way you want without having to control yourself to watching that clock to eat every 2 to 3 hours and counting calories and portion sizes of everything you eat. What the Eat Stop Eat diet basically suggests is that you follow one or two 24 hour fasting periods where you will eat nothing but stick to water and black coffee. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just the conclusion of Brad PilonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful book, but the principles behind this system and the right way to make it work to lose a lot of fat fast is outstanding. In order to lose 1 lb of body fat, you need to burn 3500 calories. When you eat normal five days a week and perform one or two 24 hour fast periods, you basically cut down on a calorie intake of over 1500 to 3500 calories! Of course you will now be worried about starvation mode and muscle loss. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why Eat Stop Eat is a book being sold and not given away freely. The book contains a lot of research showing you how this diet can actually increase growth hormone levels, boost fat loss levels and even increase your health! Brad Pilon shatters the truth about starvation mode, and destroys the myth about eating a calorie surplus to increase muscle size. He breaks every connection in his Eat Stop Eat book.\nImage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c3e7bad82e69b446c1037f86ff228d9f2116f1f","amp;dn":"Eat+Stop+Eat+by+Brad+Pilon.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c3e7bad82e69b446c1037f86ff228d9f2116f1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,62,123,173,130,230,155,68,108,16,55,248,111,242,40,217,242,17,111,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
