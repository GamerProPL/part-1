As a 10 year old I got my dad to buy it for me because ...I liked \nthe cover..!! It turned out to be one of my favourite albums ever \nbecause it was solely responsible for giving me the key to the musical \nworld outside the top 20 and completely took me off in another \ndirection!\n\nIt doesn't look like it will ever be re-released on CD, and so, as a \nlittle project I tracked down all these gems from their own \ncorresponding CDs and re-united 'em. \n\nThese are all direct rips to FLAC apart from one ... Dave Mason's \n&quot;Little Woman&quot; which proved to be very elusive, 'so I've had to use the \nvery best quality copy I could find, and 're-EQ'ed' it to FLAC.\n\nI would have preferred to do a vinyl rip but unfortunately my copy is \ncompletely worn out!\n\n'Hope these bring back some good memories :)\n\n\n\n01 Traffic - Every Mother's Son\n02 Bronco - Love\n03 Spooky Tooth -1 Am the Walrus\n04 Quintessence - Jesus, Buddha, Moses, Gauranga\n05 Mott the Hoople -Thunderbuck Ram\n06 Jethro Tull - Nothing To Say\n07 Jimmy Cliff - Going Back West\n08 Blodwyn Pig - Send Your Son to Die\n09 Dave Mason - Little Woman\n10 John &amp; Beverley Martyn - Go Out And Get It\n11 King Crimson - Cadence And Cascade\n12 If - I'm Reaching Out On All Sides\n13 Free - Oh I Wept\n14 Nick Drake - Hazey Jane I\n15 Fairport Convention - Walk Awhile\n16 Cat Stevens - Maybe You're Right\n17 Renaissance - Island\n18 Fotheringay - The Sea\n19 Clouds - Take Me To Your Leader\n\n================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53b612053f55102917b9a1fb98db9ae811b3d0b1","amp;dn":"Bumpers+-+Various+Artists++1970++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53b612053f55102917b9a1fb98db9ae811b3d0b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,182,18,5,63,85,16,41,23,185,161,251,152,219,154,232,17,179,208,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
