The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey.\r\n\r\nThe Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3939161824acf8a8661ce464fa376d161391da3","amp;dn":"Dead+by+Daylight+v1.0.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3939161824acf8a8661ce464fa376d161391da3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,147,145,97,130,74,207,138,134,97,206,70,79,163,118,209,97,57,29,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
