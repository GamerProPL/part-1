And you at least meet the Minimum System Requirements.\n\n\nIssue 5: Possible Vista &amp; Windows 7 Beta Compatibility Issue:\nIf you're unable to run the game under the normal Vista or Windows 7 Beta OS try this link on the Loader.exe and Fear2.exe App's http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-compatibility-mode/ I personally don't use vista cause its shit.\n\nIssue 6: If your game is not in the desired language Make Sure your windows is set to the desired language in your Control Panel under Language settings.\nOr you can try this:\nHow to manually change game language by editing system registry:\nSometimes, you may run into problems with in game audio and text language. For example the game may play Russian audio while you need to game to run with English audio. There is no in game option to change the language so use the steps below to manually change it by editing the system registry.\n\n1. Open a new text file in Notepad, paste the following into the new text file:\n\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Monolith Productions\\FEAR2\\1.00.0000]\n&quot;Language&quot;=&quot;LANG&quot;\n\nTo set a language of your choice, replace ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLANGÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with any of the following codes:\n\ncs - Czech\nde - German\nen - English\nes - Spanish\nfr - French\nhu - Hungarian\nit - Italian\nja - Japanese\npl - Polish\nru - Russian\n\nFor example, if you want the game to run in English, your text file should contain the following:\n\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Monolith Productions\\FEAR2\\1.00.0000]\n&quot;Language&quot;=&quot;en&quot;\n\n2. Now save the text file with the .reg extension (Choose FileÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&gt; Save As ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“&gt; Select ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“All FilesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSave as TypeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and save with the name .reg &quot;Ex: filename.reg&quot;\n\n3. Now locate the .reg file you just saved, double click it or right click it and select ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“MergeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Press Yes to the dialog box that pops up. Run the game. Note that if your game does not contain the desired language (if itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not a Multilingual version), audio stream will default to English.\n\nIssue 7: Fix for no sound! (Also fixes startup crash)\nWindows Vista:\n\nThis may not be as reliable as the solution for Windows XP, but a few people have reported it to be working.\n\n1. Download and install the Basic K-Lite Codec Pack(http://www.free-codecs.com/download_soft.php?d=5086&amp;s=775). Install all the default components. If you wish to remove any component, make sure that you don't remove the IMA ADPCM codec, or the Codec Tweak tool. If you already have the K-Lite Codec Pack installed, you may try uninstalling your old one in favor of this version.\n2. At this point you can attempt to launch FEAR 2. If it works you're done. If it doesn't, I advice you to reboot your computer before proceeding to the next step. After reboot you can try launching the game again, otherwise move on to the next step.\n3. Go to your Start menu -&gt; All Programs -&gt; K-Lite Codec Pack -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Codec Tweak tool.\n4. In this application, scroll down to the category named &quot;Codec management&quot;. If you find the &quot;IMA ADPCM&quot; (don't confuse it with the ADPCM codec, make sure it's IMA ADPCM) codec under the sub-category &quot;Enable the following codecs&quot;, check the box next to the IMA ADPCM codec, and the choose Next. Try launching FEAR 2 now. If the IMA ADPCM codec is under the sub-category &quot;Disable the following codecs&quot;, check the box and click next. Try launching FEAR 2. If it doesn't work, go back to the Codec Tweak Tool, and this time check the box next to the IMA ADPCM codec and click next to enable it again. This is experimental, that's why you're trying after disabling. If none of this worked, check back later and there may be more info available.\n\nI have seen in other recent threads that the ACE Mega Codec pack could also do the trick, but I still recommend this one since ACE installs 15 times as much crap on your computer. Very invasive.\nWindows XP:\nUpdated solution\n\n1. Open up your control panel and go to sounds, speech, and audio devices (category view), then open up Sounds and Audio Devices.\n2. Go to the &quot;Hardware&quot; tab, and select &quot;Audio codecs&quot; in the list of devices. Click the properties button.\n3. Go to the &quot;Properties&quot; tab and see if the following two codecs are present: &quot;IMA ADPCM Audio CODEC&quot; (don't confuse it with the ADPCM codec, make sure it's IMA ADPCM) and &quot;Microsoft PCM Converter&quot;. If the IMA ADPCM one is missing, see below for instructions on how to install it.\n4. If both are present, select one of them and click on the &quot;properties&quot; button. Make sure &quot;Use this audio codec&quot; is checked, then click OK. Now do the same thing with the other one.\n5. Try launching FEAR. If you've got sound, you should also be able to restore the video (.vib) files that you had to delete to launch the game.\n\nInstalling the IMA ADPCM Audio Codec\n\nThis codec is a default Windows codec. It may be absent from your list of codecs for a variety of reasons, here's how to install it.\n\n1. Go to the control panel (use classic view), and choose Add Hardware. Click next.\n2. Choose &quot;Yes, I have already...&quot;, then choose &quot;add a new hardware device&quot;, which should be at the bottom of the list.\n3. Choose the manual Advanced option, and then select sound, video and game controllers. Next.\n4. Choose &quot;Have disk...&quot; and then browse to C:\\Windows\\system32 and choose the mmdriver (.inf) and click OK. If you can't find the mmdriver file, you can download and use this one instead. (http://www.infdump.com/download-inf-files_new.php/inffiles/M/mmdriver.inf/-/download.html)\n5. You will get a warning. Choose continue anyway, and you will see a list of codecs and the likes. Find and install the &quot;IMA ADPCM Audio CODEC&quot;.\n6. You will get another warning before you install the codec. Choose continue anyway to install.\n7. Reboot your computer.\n8. Repeat steps 3-5 in the &quot;Updated solution&quot; guide above.\n\nOld solution\n\n1. Open up your control panel and go to sounds, speech, and audio devices (category view), then open up Sounds and Audio Devices.\n2. Go to the &quot;Hardware&quot; tab, and select &quot;Audio codecs&quot; in the list of devices. Click the properties button.\n3. Go to the &quot;Properties&quot; tab and select the &quot;Windows Media Audio&quot; codec.* Click on properties.\n4. Make sure &quot;Use this audio codec&quot; is selected, then change the priority to 1. Apply these settings.\n5. Start FEAR 2. If you've got sound, you should also be able to restore your video (.vib) files that you had to delete to start the game. No more crashes.\n\nIssue 8: OnBoard Graphics/Sound Shit\nIf you have a SoundMax or AC97 or AnalogDevices SoundCards And Or your using your onboard Audio/Video. This game may and possibly Will Encounter issues such as game crashes, Bad sound(includes audio glitches,static and jumps), And Bad Graphics(if your using your onboard video) And Serious Game Lag Glitches.
