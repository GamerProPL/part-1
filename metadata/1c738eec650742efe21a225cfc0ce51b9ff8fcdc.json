It is loosely based on the book of the same name by the French author AnaÃƒÂ¯s Nin, and tells the story of Nin's relationship with Henry Miller and his wife, June.\nThe story takes place in and around Paris, France in 1931. The story told is one of a love triangle between the Millers and AnaÃƒÂ¯s Nin. She is in a stable relationship with Hugo, but longs for more out of life. When AnaÃƒÂ¯s Nin first meets Henry Miller, she sees in him a rough man from New York. He has a talent for literature and is working on his first book. Nin sees Henry and his wife June as having a liberating, bohemian lifestyle that she is drawn to. Nin becomes involved in the couple's tormented relationship, having an affair with Henry and also pursuing June. Ultimately, Nin helps Henry to publish his novel, Tropic of Cancer, but catalyzes the Millers' separation, while she returns to her husband Hugo.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099762/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099762/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOriginal release and screeenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/index.php?showtopic=387037&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/index.php?showtopic=387037&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFORMAT..........: MKV\nCODEC...........: X264\nGENRE...........: Biography Drama\nFILE SIZE.......: 2.10 GB\nRESOLUTION......: 720*420\nASPECT RATIO....: 1.85 : 1\nFRAME RATE......: 23.976 fps\nAUDIO...........: 192 Kbps Ac3 (2CH)\nLANGUAGE........: Italian - English - Spanish\nSUBTITLES.......: English - French - German - Portuguese - Dutch - Danish - Swedish - Norwegian - Finnish\nRUNTIME.........: 136 mins\n\nGeneric infos\nDuration                    02:16:06 (8166.492 s)\nContainer                   matroska\nTotal tracks                13\nTrack nr. 1                 video (V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC) {eng}\nTrack nr. 2                 audio (A_AC3) {ita}\nTrack nr. 3                 audio (A_AC3) {eng}\nTrack nr. 4                 audio (A_AC3) {spa}\nTrack nr. 5                 subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {eng}\nTrack nr. 6                 subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {fre}\nTrack nr. 7                 subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {ger}\nTrack nr. 8                 subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {por}\nTrack nr. 9                 subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {dut}\nTrack nr. 10                subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {dan}\nTrack nr. 11                subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {swe}\nTrack nr. 12                subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {nor}\nTrack nr. 13                subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {fin}\nMuxing library              libebml v1.2.3 + libmatroska v1.3.0\n\nRelevant data\nResolution                  720 x 420\nWidth                       multiple of 16\nHeight                      multiple of 4\nAverage DRF                 20.246027\nStandard deviation          3.951464\nStd. dev. weighted mean     3.898475\n\nVideo track\nCodec ID                    V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nResolution                  720 x 420\nDisplay resolution          888 x 480 (pixels)\nFrame aspect ratio          12:7 = 1.714286\nPixel aspect ratio          259:240 = 1.079167\nDisplay aspect ratio        37:20 = 1.85\nFramerate                   23.976025 fps\nStream size                 1,663,742,389 bytes (1586.668386 MiB)\nDuration (bs)               02:16:06 (8166.491406 s)\nBitrate (bs)                1629.82344 kbps\nQf                          0.224792\n\nAudio track nr. 1\nCodec ID                    A_AC3\nSampling frequency          48000 Hz\nChannels                    2\nBitstream type (bs)         AC3\nFrames (bs)                 255,194\nDuration (bs)               02:16:06 (8166.208 s)\nChunk-aligned (bs)          Yes\nBitrate (bs)                192 kbps CBR\nSampling frequency (bs)     48000 Hz\nMode (bs)                   stereo\n\nAudio track nr. 2\nCodec ID                    A_AC3\nSampling frequency          48000 Hz\nChannels                    2\nFrames (bs)                 255,200\nDuration (bs)               02:16:06 (8166.4 s)\nChunk-aligned (bs)          Yes\nBitrate (bs)                192 kbps CBR\nSampling frequency (bs)     48000 Hz\nMode (bs)                   stereo\n\nAudio track nr. 3\nCodec ID                    A_AC3\nSampling frequency          48000 Hz\nChannels                    2\nBitstream type (bs)         AC3\nFrames (bs)                 255,202\nDuration (bs)               02:16:06 (8166.464 s)\nChunk-aligned (bs)          Yes\nBitrate (bs)                192 kbps CBR\nSampling frequency (bs)     48000 Hz\nMode (bs)                   stereo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c738eec650742efe21a225cfc0ce51b9ff8fcdc","amp;dn":"Henry+and+June+-+1990+-+ITA-ENG-ESP+-+Multisub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c738eec650742efe21a225cfc0ce51b9ff8fcdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,115,142,236,101,7,66,239,226,26,34,92,252,12,229,27,159,248,252,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
