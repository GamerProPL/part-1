But while much of the brainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work still remains a mystery, a growing body of scientific evidence suggests that the food you eat directly affects how well your brain functions.

She then translates the very best of brain science into the kitchen, using delicious nutrient-dense foods as a tool for promoting a healthy mind from childhood through the golden years. \n\nWith a culinary pharmacy listing the benefits of key ingredients, complete nutritional details for each dish, and flavor-packed recipes for every meal of the day, including Avocado and Citrus Salad, Sweet Potato Hash, Turkish Lamb Sliders, and Chocolate Cherry Walnut Truffles, The Healthy Mind Cookbook will help lift the fog of everyday life so you can reach your full physical and mental potential","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2baf84371efb790fd320b86ec42908f94cc619a","amp;dn":"The+Healthy+Mind+Cookbook+%282015%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2baf84371efb790fd320b86ec42908f94cc619a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,186,248,67,113,239,183,144,253,50,11,134,236,66,144,143,148,204,97,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
