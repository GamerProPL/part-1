Born in 1992 in Dallas, TX, she was raised in a household that included her mother, a former Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader, and her two sisters, the youngest of whom launched her own acting career in 2008. Demi started out as a child actress, starring as a cast regular on Barney and Friends before finding her way onto the Disney Channel with a brief role in As the Bell Rings. Lovato's debut album, Don't Forget, featuring songs co-written by the Jonas Brothers, was released by Hollywood Records several months after Camp Rock's premiere. It debuted at number two, confirming Lovato's status as a star in her own right, and was followed in 2009 by the chart-topping Here We Go Again. Meanwhile, Lovato continued to act, appearing in a popular sequel to Camp Rock and starring in her own Disney series, Sonny with a Chance.\n\n\n\n============\n| CONTENTS |\n============\n\n* Album Artwork\n* 3 Studio Albums\n\n\n\n=========\n| INFO  |\n=========\n\nBirth Name: Demetria Devonne Lovato\nBorn: August 20, 1992 in Dallas, TX\nBorn: Pop\nYear's Active: '00s, '10s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c1bc0460b3a90f7b856b1d7ea6ce2db75b1a1d9","amp;dn":"Demi+Lovato+Discography+%28iTunes+Edition%29+%5BtheLEAK%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c1bc0460b3a90f7b856b1d7ea6ce2db75b1a1d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,27,192,70,11,58,144,247,184,86,177,215,234,108,226,219,117,177,161,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
