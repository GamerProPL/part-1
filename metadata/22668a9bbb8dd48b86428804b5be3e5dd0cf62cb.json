King has \n\ndescribed the series as his magnum opus. Besides the eight \n\nnovels that compose the series proper, many of King's other \n\nbooks relate to the story, introducing concepts and characters \n\nthat come into play as the series progresses. After the series \n\nwas finished, a series of prequel comics followed.\n\n===============================================\n\nIn the story, Roland Deschain is the last living member of a \n\nknightly order known as gunslingers and the last of the line of \n\n&quot;Arthur Eld&quot;, his world's analogue of King Arthur. Politically \n\norganized along the lines of a feudal society, it shares \n\ntechnological and social characteristics with the American Old \n\nWest but is also magical. Many of the magical aspects have vanished \n\nfrom Mid-World, but traces remain as do relics from a technologically \n\nadvanced society. Roland's quest is to find the Dark Tower, a fabled \n\nbuilding said to be the nexus of all universes. Roland's world is \n\nsaid to have &quot;moved on&quot;, and it appears to be coming apart at the \n\nseams. Mighty nations have been torn apart by war, entire cities and \n\nregions vanish without a trace and time does not flow in an orderly \n\nfashion. Sometimes, even the sun rises in the north and sets in the \n\neast. As the series opens, Roland's motives, goals and age are unclear, \n\nthough later installments shed light on these mysteries.\n\n===============================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22668a9bbb8dd48b86428804b5be3e5dd0cf62cb","amp;dn":"The+Dark+Tower+Books+1-8+%28epub+mobi+pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22668a9bbb8dd48b86428804b5be3e5dd0cf62cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,102,138,155,187,141,212,139,134,66,136,4,181,190,62,93,208,207,98,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
