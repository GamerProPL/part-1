He was BBC television's science anchor and chief reporter on the Project Apollo missions, including being the main presenter on the BBC's coverage of the first moon landings in 1969 alongside Patrick Moore. \n\nBurke followed in the footsteps of Sir Kenneth Clark's Civilisation and Jacob Bronowski's The Ascent of Man with his most important work: a highly acclaimed 10-part documentary series Connections (1978) that was first aired on the BBC and subsequently on PBS channels in the United States. The series traced paths of invention and discovery through their interrelationships in history, with each episode chronicling a particular path, usually in chronological order, and was a great success for Burke. \n\nIt was followed by the 20-part Connections 2 in 1994 and then the 10-part Connections 3 in 1997. Later, it was shown in more than 50 countries and appeared in about 350 university and college curricula. Additionally, the book that followed the series was also a best seller on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nHere are all three series for your enjoyment.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a23296ce90328791cb6974cf6f6306da4dd89735","amp;dn":"James+Burke+-+Connections++%28BBC+-+Series+1%2C+2+and+3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a23296ce90328791cb6974cf6f6306da4dd89735","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,50,150,206,144,50,135,145,203,105,116,207,111,99,6,218,77,216,151,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
