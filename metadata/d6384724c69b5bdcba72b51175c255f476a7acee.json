Modeled to the smallest of details you will find all buildings, installations, docking-systems, just about everything you can expect from a modern airport and of course a modern 3D realization.\n\nThe airport of Lisbon is the most important international gate into Portugal and also the home of its national carrier TAP-Air. Approx. 16 million passengers, 140.000 flight movements and 88.000 tons of cargo makes this airport one of the busiest in southern Europe. ItÃ‚Â´s also especially important as a hub for connections between Europe and South America. Before its inauguration in 1940 Lisbon had an air service via the &quot;Campo Internacional de Aterragem&quot; near Alverca. After its closure all connections were handed over to the new airport. The last years saw the airport being extended with the new Terminal 1 and some more docking facilities on apron 12 and 14.\n\nThe Mega Airport Lisbon V2.0 has been modeled on the basis of a high resolution aerial image with many dynamic and static objects to visualize the busy atmosphere at this airport. Lisbon airport has also been modeled with the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rapid ExitsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on runway 03/21 as in real life. Even though there are a lot of objects, details and features, the frame rate has been kept high.\n\nFeatures:\n\nHigh resolution day- and night textures\nAll buildings and airport institutions\nAI compatible\nAutomatic docking-systems\nExcellent frame rates\nHigh resolution ground textures based on an aerial image (0.5m per pixel)\nPhoto-real textures on buildings and vehicles\nHundreds of taxiway- and runway signs\nNumerous static and dynamic objects such as service vehicles, buses, etc.\nRET system (high speed exits at runways)\nCompatible with AES\nCompatible to Portugal SRTM Mesh and Ultimate Terrain Europe\nComplete new ground layout according to todayÃ‚Â´s information\nNew approach lights with PAPIÃ‚Â´s, new taxi lighting, new lighting effects\nNew modeled terrain and motorway bridge at the end of runway 21\nAES lite for dynamic car traffic\nExtension of Terminal 1 and apron 12 and 14","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6384724c69b5bdcba72b51175c255f476a7acee","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%2FP3D%2FP3D2%5D+Aerosoft+Mega+Airport+Lisbon+V2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6384724c69b5bdcba72b51175c255f476a7acee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,56,71,36,198,155,91,220,186,114,181,17,117,194,85,244,118,167,172,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
