We recognize the limitations of the organic model as a substitute to conventional fruit growing, and want to propose a more holistic, regenerative approach based on permaculture principles. Based on 20 years of applied theory and trial and error, biologist and educator Stefan Sobkowiak shares his experience transforming a conventional apple orchard into an abundance of biodiversity that virtually takes care of itself. The concepts, techniques and tips presented in this film will help you with your own project, whether it is just a few fruit trees in your urban backyard, or a full-scale multi-acre commercial orchard.\n\nSTEFAN SOBKOWIAK\n\nTrained as a biologist and landscape architect, Stefan has taught fruit production, landscape plants and design, and natural history of vertebrates at MontrealÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s McGill University. He owned a landscape design firm for 20 years, developping hundreds of projects for private, institutional and municipal clients. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been teaching permaculture in Quebec since 1995. Stefan is the owner of Miracle Farms since 1993.\n\nFILM CONTENTS\n\ncreating habitat for birds / pollinators\nnatural pest control techniques\nthe trio system / plant combinations\nthe shrub + herbaceous layers\nseed planting of annuals\nplanting fruit trees / drainage considerations\ntree training vs. pruning\ngrafting / overgrafting\nstarting your own trees vs. buying trees\nmulch options with a focus on plastic mulch and why/how\ndrip irrigation\nthe importance of cultivar selection\nthe grocery aisle concept\nspraying / fungi control\ntree protection\nfrost protection","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98f8dcde31d835b309e80fae110e88ce4e750b22","amp;dn":"The+Permaculture+Orchard%3A+Beyond+Organic+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98f8dcde31d835b309e80fae110e88ce4e750b22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,248,220,222,49,216,53,179,9,232,15,174,17,14,136,206,78,117,11,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
