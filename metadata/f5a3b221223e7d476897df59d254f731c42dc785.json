To read an ECG correctly, one has to be thorough with the basic knowledge of electromechanical system of the heart. It also requires a lot of imaginations and logic conclusions. Teaching ECG to an undergraduate student is a challenging task for the teacher. \n\nThe teacher has to use a lot of innovative ideas to kindle an interest in the student to the interpretation of ECG.I am extremely proud of my student, Dr Sajjan, who took keen interest in my ECG classes and with his strong foundation of cardiology and multimedia skills, brought out this practical book Learn ECG in a Day: A Systematic Approch. He made it very simple, interesting and practical by using his own innovative ideas and methods.\nProbably,\tthis\tis\tthe\tfirst\tbook\ton\tECG\twritten\tby\tan\tinternist\tfor\tthe\tbenefit of not only undergraduates but also for postgraduates in General Medicine. This is also an example of how a young mind can blossom with new ideas and skills if given proper guidance and opportunity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5a3b221223e7d476897df59d254f731c42dc785","amp;dn":"Learn+ECG+in+a+Day+%28Jaypee%29+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5a3b221223e7d476897df59d254f731c42dc785","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,163,178,33,34,62,125,71,104,151,223,89,210,84,247,49,196,45,199,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
