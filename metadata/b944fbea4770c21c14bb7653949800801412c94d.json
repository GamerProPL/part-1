G. Jung (1875 - 1961) before his death.  It is divided into five parts, four of which are written by associates of Jung: Joseph L. Henderson, Marie-Louise von Franz, Aniela JaffÃƒÂ©, and Jolande Jacobi.  The book is heavily illustrated and is meant to be an abridged conglomeration of many of Jung's theories and was originally written for a general audience rather than psychology students.\n\n\nA PDF of this book can be found here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5253951/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5253951/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b944fbea4770c21c14bb7653949800801412c94d","amp;dn":"Carl+Gustav+Jung+-+Man+and+His+Symbols+%281964%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b944fbea4770c21c14bb7653949800801412c94d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,68,251,234,71,112,194,28,20,187,118,83,148,152,0,128,20,18,201,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
