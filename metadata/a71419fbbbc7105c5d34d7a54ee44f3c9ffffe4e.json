This is the period of the first and perhaps greatest Roman Emperors and it's a colorful story of rule and ruination, running from the rise of Augustus through to the death of Nero. Holland's expansive history also has distinct shades of I Claudius, with five wonderfully vivid (and in three cases, thoroughly depraved) Emperorsâ€”Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Neroâ€”featured, along with numerous fascinating secondary characters. Intrigue, murder, naked ambition and treachery, greed, gluttony, lust, incest, pageantry, decadenceâ€”the tale of these five Caesars continues to cast a mesmerizing spell across the millennia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a71419fbbbc7105c5d34d7a54ee44f3c9ffffe4e","amp;dn":"Dynasty%3A+The+Rise+and+Fall+of+the+House+of+Caesar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a71419fbbbc7105c5d34d7a54ee44f3c9ffffe4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,20,25,251,187,199,16,92,93,52,215,165,78,228,79,60,159,255,254,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
