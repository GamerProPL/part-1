In Conceptual Physics with MasteringPhysicsÃ‚Â®, 11/e  Paul Hewitt shows how a compelling text and the most advanced media can be integrated to empower professors as they bring physics to life for non-science majors, both in and out of class. For the Eleventh Edition , Hewitt helps students connect physics to their everyday experiences and the world around them, and provides additional help on solving mathematical problems.\nHewittÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s text is famous for engaging students with analogies and imagery from real-world situations that build a strong conceptual understanding of physical principles ranging from classical mechanics to modern physics. With this strong foundation, students are better equipped to understand the equations and formulas of physics, and are motivated to explore the thought-provoking exercises and fun projects in each chapter. The new edition features a fresh new design, content that is more focused on physics applications, updated pedagogical features, and access to MasteringPhysics.  \n\nAbout the Author\nFormer silver-medal boxing champion, sign painter, uranium prospector, and soldier, Paul G. Hewitt began college at the age of 27, with the help of the GI Bill. He pioneered the conceptual approach to teaching physics at the City College of San Francisco. He has taught as a guest teacher at various middle schools and high schools, the University of California at both the Berkeley and Santa Cruz campuses, and the University of Hawaii at both the Manoa and Hilo campuses. He also taught for 20 years at the Exploratorium in San Francisco, which honored him with its Outstanding Educator Award in 2000. He is the author of Conceptual Physics and a co-author of Conceptual Physical Science and Conceptual Physical Science Explorations (with John and Leslie).\n\nTable of Contents\n1. About Science \nI.
