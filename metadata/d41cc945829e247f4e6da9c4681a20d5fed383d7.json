He is commonly ranked as one of the most influential English writers of the 20th century and as one of the most important chroniclers of English culture of his generation.  \n\nOrwell's work is marked by lucid prose, awareness of social injustice, opposition to totalitarianism, and commitment to democratic socialism.  He is best known for the dystopian novel NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR (1949) and the allegorical novella ANIMAL FARM (1945).  His book HOMAGE TO CATALONIA (1938), an account of his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, is widely acclaimed, as are his numerous essays on politics, literature, language, and culture.
