In a famous essay, &quot;On Impure Poetry&quot; (included in Belitt's edition of SELECTED POEMS), Neruda calls for &quot;a poetry as impure as old clothes, as a body with its foodstains and its shame, with wrinkles, observations, dreams, wakefulness, prophesies, declarations of love and hate, stupidities, shocks, idylls, political beliefs, negations, doubts, affirmations, and taxes.&quot;\n\nThis collection features a large selection of his poetical works, many in bilingual editions.  Highlights include TWENTY LOVE POEMS (1924) that launched him into the international spotlight; RESIDENCE ON EARTH (1933), a collection of esoteric surrealistic poems which marked a literary breakthrough; CANTO GENERAL (1950), an epic poem tracing the history of Latin America and evoking the grandeur of its landscape; SELECTED ODES (1954-57); THE CAPTAIN'S VERSES (1963), passionately sensuous and exploding with all the erotic energy of a new love; ISLA NEGRA (1964), where Neruda &quot;in the company of his muse, walked alongside the source of his most lyrical inspiration, the sea ... and discovered a new way of seeing, as the ocean became a living metaphor for the infinite riches of the world&quot;; and THE BOOK OF QUESTIONS (1973), finished only month before his death and composed of 316 unanswerable questions, by turns Orphic, comic, surreal, and poignant.\n\nIn his MEMOIRS (1974), Neruda retraces his bohemian student years, his time as Chilean consul and senator, his years in hiding, up to and including the 1972 coup that overthrew Salvador Allende.  Many of the century's most important literary and artistic figures were Neruda's friends, and figure in these memoirs -- Garcia Lorca, Aragon, Picasso, and Rivera, among them -- and also such political leaders as Gandhi, Nehru, Mao, Castro, and Che Guevara.  In his uniquely expressive prose, Neruda not only explains his views on poetry and describes the circumstances that inspired many of his poems, but he creates a revealing record of his life as a poet, a patriot, and one of the twentieth century's true men of conscience.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n* 2000 (Azul Editions, 1992).
