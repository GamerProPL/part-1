Astonishing X-Men is a volume that was started in 2004 by Joss Whedon and John Cassaday as part of the X-Men: Reload event. Their run had some major events such as the return of Colossus and ended with issue 24 and a Giant-Sized Astonishing X-Men Issue. Writer Warren Ellis and Simone Bianchi came on with issue 25. Ellis remained the writer until issue 35. After a six month hiatus, Daniel Way and Jason Pearson took over as the newest creative team with issue 36. Following brief stint by Christos Gage and Greg Pak, Marjorie Liu took over as the writer with issue 48 as the new regular writer. The series will end following issue 68, to be replaced by Amazing X-Men, which will be written by Jason Aaron, focusing on Wolverine's X-Men team, as well as featuring the return of Nightcrawler.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3862a9f2d25e0f2c32facf68d74dc2ec086b6cbb","amp;dn":"Astonishing+X-Men+v3+%28001+-+068%29+%28complete%29+%28-+Nem+-%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3862a9f2d25e0f2c32facf68d74dc2ec086b6cbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,98,169,242,210,94,15,44,50,250,207,104,215,77,194,236,8,107,108,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
