The film won three Golden Globe Awards among various awards including cinematography awards for Vilmos Zsigmond as well as best actor for Robert Duvall. Filming was done in Budapest, Hungary and Moscow, Russia, with extraordinary access to Kremlin buildings in the weeks surrounding the Dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe film portrays the political career and personal life of the former leader of the Soviet Union, Georgian-born Ioseb Jughashvili, who later adopted the name Joseph Stalin demonstrating his rule and how he was able to bring the Soviet Union to a place of great power on the world stage, but at a consequence: in this case, the destruction of his family as well as the mass murder of millions of his own Revolutionary partners. The focus is on the behaviour of Stalin and the after effects. The story is as narrated by Stalin's daughter, who defected to the United States in 1967.\n\nCast\nRobert Duvall as Joseph Stalin\nJulia Ormond as Nadezhda Alliluyeva\nMaximilian Schell as Vladimir Lenin\nJeroen KrabbÃƒÂ© as Nikolai Bukharin\nJoan Plowright as Olga Alliluyeva\nFrank Finlay as Sergei Alliluyev\nDaniel Massey as Leon Trotsky\nAndrÃƒÂ¡s BÃƒÂ¡lint as Grigory Zinoviev\nEmil Wolk as Lev Kamenev\nRoshan Seth as Lavrentiy Beria\nMÃƒÂ¡tyÃƒÂ¡s Usztics as Nikolai Yezhov\nJohn Bowe as Kliment Voroshilov\nJim Carter as Sergo Ordzhonikidze\nMurray Ewan as Nikita Khrushchev\nStella Gonet as Zinaida &quot;Zina&quot; Volkova\nElena Seropova as Nino Beria\nColin Jeavons as Genrikh Yagoda\nMiriam Margolyes as Nadezhda Krupskaya\nKevin McNally as Sergey Kirov\nClive Merrison as Vyacheslav Molotov\nLisa Orgolini as Anya Larina\nJoanna Roth as Svetlana Alliluyeva\nAleksandr Feklistov as Leonid Nikolaev","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bdfb7762e8795ec70b89734b77ecc3b5f824c77","amp;dn":"Stalin+-+HBO+Films+%5B1992%5D+DVDrip%2C+Robert+Duvall%2C+Julia+Ormond","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bdfb7762e8795ec70b89734b77ecc3b5f824c77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,223,183,118,46,135,149,236,112,184,151,52,183,126,204,59,95,130,76,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
