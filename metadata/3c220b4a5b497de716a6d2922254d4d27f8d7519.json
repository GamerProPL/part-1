Conflict over natural resources can escalate to state and non-state actors, resulting in wars, asymmetrical warfare, and terrorism. Crank and Jacoby apply criminological theory to each aspect of this complicated web, helping readers to evaluate conflicting claims about global warming and to analyze evidence of the current and potential impact of climate change on conflict and crime. Beginning with an overview of the science of global warming, the authors move on to the links between climate change, scarce resources, and crime. Their approach takes in the full scope of causes and consequences, present and future, in the United States and throughout the world. The book concludes by looking ahead at the problem of forecasting future security implications if global warming continues or accelerates. This fresh approach to the criminology of climate change challenges readers to examine all sides of this controversial question and to formulate their own analysis of our planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c220b4a5b497de716a6d2922254d4d27f8d7519","amp;dn":"Crime%2C+Violence+and+Global+Warming+-+1st+Ed+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c220b4a5b497de716a6d2922254d4d27f8d7519","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,34,11,74,91,73,125,231,22,166,210,146,34,84,212,210,127,141,117,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
