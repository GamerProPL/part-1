We see varying versions of his life reflected in the work of Machiavelli, Luther, Voltaire, German and English romantics, pre-Raphaelites, Italian nationalists, and Mussolini, and discover how peace activists, ecologists, or interreligious dialogists have used his example to promote their various causes. Particularly noteworthy is the attention Vauchez pays to Francisâ€™s own writings, which strangely enough have been largely overlooked by later interpreters.\r\n\r\nThe product of a lifetime of study, this book reveals a historian at the height of his powers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a13f7e0af927faa466607bd880ec6e16029a8be","amp;dn":"Francis+of+Assisi%3A+The+Life+and+Afterlife+of+a+Medieval+Saint","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a13f7e0af927faa466607bd880ec6e16029a8be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,19,247,224,175,146,127,170,70,102,7,189,136,14,198,225,96,41,168,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
