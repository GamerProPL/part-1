These files may be a little large for some.  But if you aren't worried about space, and want a higher quality, then this is for you.  If you enjoyed my Next Generation rips, then you'll enjoy these as well.  The quality is even better since the quality of these original dvd's is better.  I've previewed the episodes and they look and sound great on my 50 inch lcd/surround sound system.\n\nSource: DVD Rip\nAverage file size: 550mb\n\nContainer: MKV\nVideo: x264\nResolution: 720 x 480, (loose anamorphic 720 x 547) give or take a few pixels depending on necessary cropping.\n\nAudio: English, 5.1 AC3\n\nSubtitles: English subrip srt (in MKV)\n\nI will be releasing the rest of the series as I finish ripping each season.\n\nHope you enjoy!!\n\nPlease seed when you are done...a good rule of thumb is to upload at least as much as you've downloaded...thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3753b68c343b202f9d2ae8004865029511ae378","amp;dn":"Star.Trek.DS9.Deep.Space.Nine.9.Season.1.HQ.x264.5.1.ac3.subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3753b68c343b202f9d2ae8004865029511ae378","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,117,59,104,195,67,178,2,249,210,174,128,4,134,80,41,81,26,227,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
