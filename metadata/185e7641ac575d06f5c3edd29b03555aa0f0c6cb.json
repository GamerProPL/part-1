They formed the group &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; in 1957, and had their first taste of success with the minor hit &quot;Hey, Schoolgirl.&quot; As Simon and Garfunkel, the duo rose to fame in 1965, backed by the hit single &quot;The Sound of Silence.&quot; Their music was featured in the landmark film The Graduate, propelling them further into the public consciousness.\n\nThey are well known for their close vocal harmonies and sometimes unstable relationship. Their last album, Bridge over Troubled Water, was delayed several times due to artistic disagreements. They were among the most popular recording artists of the 1960s; among their biggest hits, in addition to &quot;The Sound of Silence,&quot; were &quot;I Am a Rock,&quot; &quot;Homeward Bound,&quot; &quot;A Hazy Shade of Winter,&quot; &quot;Mrs. Robinson,&quot; &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water,&quot; &quot;The Boxer,&quot; &quot;Cecilia,&quot; and &quot;Scarborough Fair.&quot; They have received several Grammys and are inductees of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame (2007). In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked Simon and Garfunkel #40 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\n\nThey have reunited on several occasions since their 1970 breakup, most famously for 1981's The Concert in Central Park, which attracted about 500,000 people.\n\nDisc One\n\n   1. &quot;The Sound Of Silence&quot;\n   2. &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M&quot; (Live)\n   3. &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; (Live)\n   4. &quot;Bleecker Street&quot;\n   5. &quot;I Am A Rock&quot;\n   6. &quot;A Most Peculiar Man&quot; (Live)\n   7. &quot;Richard Cory&quot;\n   8. &quot;Kathy's Song&quot; (live)\n   9. &quot;Scarborough Fair/Canticle&quot; (Garfunkel/Simon)\n  10. &quot;Homeward Bound&quot;\n  11. &quot;Sparrow&quot; (live)\n  12. &quot;Leaves That Are Green&quot; (Live)\n  13. &quot;He Was My Brother&quot;\n  14. &quot;The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)&quot; (live)\n  15. &quot;The Dangling Conversation&quot;\n  16. &quot;A Poem On The Underground Wall&quot; (Live)\n  17. &quot;Blessed&quot; (Live)\n  18. &quot;Cloudy&quot;\n  19. &quot;Blues Run The Game&quot; (Jackson C.
