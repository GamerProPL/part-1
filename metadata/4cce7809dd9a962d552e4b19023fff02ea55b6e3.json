Olivia, trapped in the parallel universe, is subjected to experimentation by Walternate to explore her Cortexiphan-induced powers. She is able to escape to her own universe using her Cortexiphan abilities and expose Fauxlivia to Peter, but has difficulty coming to emotional grips with Fauxlivia's influence on Peter and her life. The prime universe has also found the parts and assembled their version of the doomsday device, though prior to her return to the parallel universe, Fauxlivia was able to withdraw a key component and send it to the parallel universe. Upon her return, Fauxlivia discovers she is pregnant with Peter's child.\n\nEpisode List:\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Fringe_episodes#Season_3_.282010.E2.80.932011.29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Fringe_episodes#Season_3_.282010.E2.80.932011.29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFormat :\t\tXviD\nFile size:  \t\t200MiB avg per episode\nDuration : \t\t43min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t\t624 pixels\nHeight : \t\t352 pixels\nAspect ratio : \t        16:9\nFrame rate : \t        23.976 fps\nAudio: \t\t        MP3\nNr. of Files: \t        22 + 1 Titlepic + 2 Trailer + 1 txt = 26\n\n\nAll files properly named!\nThis pack wouldnÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t have been possible without eztv, VTV, TvTeam, etc. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ thank you all!
