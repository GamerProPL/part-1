It's not a tragedy. It's an opportunity. Charlie always thought his body could be better. He begins to explore a few ideas. To build parts. Better parts.\n\nProsthetist Lola Shanks loves a good artificial limb. In Charlie, she sees a man on his way to becoming artificial everything. But others see a madman. Or a product. Or a weapon.\n\nA story for the age of pervasive technology, Machine Man is a gruesomely funny unraveling of one man's quest for ultimate self-improvement.\n\n\nRead by Sean Runnette\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b1642c792d623e1825786392cf2291b291b189e","amp;dn":"Max+Barry+-+Machine+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b1642c792d623e1825786392cf2291b291b189e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,22,66,199,146,214,35,225,130,87,134,57,44,242,41,27,41,27,24,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
