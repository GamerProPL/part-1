In Bread Revolution, he explores the cutting-edge developments in bread baking, with fifty recipes and formulas that use sprouted flours, whole and ancient grains, nut and seed flours, alternative flours (such as teff and grape skin), and allergy-friendly and gluten-free approaches.\nA new generation of bakers and millers are developing innovative flours and baking techniques that are designed to extract the grainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s full flavor potentialÃ¢â‚¬â€what Reinhart calls Ã¢â‚¬Å“the bakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mission.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In this lushly photographed primer, Reinhart draws inspiration from these groundbreaking methods to create master recipes and formulas any home baker can follow, including Sprouted Sandwich Rye Bread, Gluten-Free Many-Seed Toasting Bread, and Sprouted Wheat Croissants.\nIn many instances, such as with sprouted flours, preferments arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t necessary because so much of the flavor development occurs during the sprouting phase. For grains that benefit from soakers, bigas, and sourdough starters, Reinhart provides the precise guidance that has made him such a trusted expert in the field.\nAdvanced bakers will relish ReinhartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inventive techniques and exacting scientific explanations, while beginning bakers will rejoice in his demystification of ingredients and methodsÃ¢â‚¬â€and all will come away thrilled by breadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new frontier.\n\nAbout the Author\nPETER REINHART is a baking instructor and faculty member at Johnson and Wales University in Charlotte, North Carolina. He was the cofounder of Brother Juniper's Bakery in Santa Rosa, California, and is the author of eight books on bread baking, including Crust and Crumb and The Bread Baker's Apprentice (winner of the 2002 James Beard Cookbook of the Year and IACP Cookbook of the Year), and the 2008 James Beard Award-winning Peter Reinhart's Whole Grain Breads.\n\nCONTENTS\nIntroduction\nCHAPTER 1 - TUTORIAL\nCHAPTER 2 - A SOURDOUGH PRIMER\nCHAPTER 3 - SPROUTED FLOUR BREADS\nCHAPTER 4 - SPROUTED PULP BREADS\nCHAPTER 5 - WHOLE GRAINS AND WHOLE MILLING\nCHAPTER 6 - THE NEXT NEW BREAD FRONTIER\nEPILOGUE - IS THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED THE ROAD AHEAD?\nResources\nAcknowledgments\nAbout the Author\nIndex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8936b1cc79ea80a00cdbcb482ebe2c9885d9a6b5","amp;dn":"Bread+Revolution+-+World-Class+Baking+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8936b1cc79ea80a00cdbcb482ebe2c9885d9a6b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,54,177,204,121,234,128,160,12,219,203,72,46,190,44,152,133,217,166,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
