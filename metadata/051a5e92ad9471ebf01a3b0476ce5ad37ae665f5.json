Their first disc on HyperionÃ¢â‚¬â€his Ã¢â‚¬ËœDeath and the MaidenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœRosamundeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ quartetsÃ¢â‚¬â€received unprecedently lavish critical acclaim, acknowledging a new modern benchmark for these works. Now they turn to perhaps the most hauntingly beautiful of all SchubertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chamber works, the String QuintetÃ¢â‚¬â€completed six weeks before the composerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. Schubert included a second cello in the texture, creating a sumptuously warm sound, a cradling intimacy. Here the TakÃƒÂ¡cs players are joined by cellist Ralph Kirshbaum. Also recorded here is the Ã¢â‚¬ËœQuartettsatzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢: a fragmentÃ¢â‚¬â€of the highest qualityÃ¢â‚¬â€of a String Quartet in C minor abandoned by the composer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:051a5e92ad9471ebf01a3b0476ce5ad37ae665f5","amp;dn":"Schubert+-+String+Quintet+in+C+major+%5BHD+Tracks%5D+24.96","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"051a5e92ad9471ebf01a3b0476ce5ad37ae665f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,26,94,146,173,148,113,235,240,26,59,4,118,206,90,211,122,230,101,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
