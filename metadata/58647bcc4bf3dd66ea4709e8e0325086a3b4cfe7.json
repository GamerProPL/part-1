Endorsement from the label of Colour Haze guitarist/vocalist Stefan Koglek, which has released albums from My Sleeping Karma, Sungrazer, Rotor, Been Obscene and The Machine Ã¢â‚¬â€œ essentially casting the blueprint by which a goodly portion of the up and coming European scene is built Ã¢â‚¬â€œ goes a long way in my book, and the feat is even more impressive when one considers that the Nashville four-pieceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut full-length, Our Mother Electricity (produced by the band with Andy Putnam), sounds so distinctly American. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not the first to use the wordplay, but in calling their approach Ã¢â‚¬Å“psychedelta rock,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ neither are All Them Witches inaccurate. Swampy blues is definitely a major element in what they do, but along with that and the heavy psych aspect to their sound, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a dynamic sense of Americana in the songwriting.
