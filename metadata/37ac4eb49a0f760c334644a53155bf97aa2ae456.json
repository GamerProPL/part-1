Your word is law.\nOverview:\nGet in touch with your despotic side in Overlord, the twisted fantasy action adventure where you can be evil (or really evil). In the game's seriously warped fantasy world, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll become the Overlord and find out for yourself whether absolute power corrupts absolutely. You could be a regular Overlord who only overlords during banking hours. However, with incredible power at your disposal and a team of evil-minded impish critters, the Minions, on hand to do your bidding, how will you resist the temptation to be wonderfully despotic?\n\nDelve deeper into the Overlord's twisted world as Overlord: Raising Hell opens up a series of hellish new levels, each a twisted, corrupted version of the five major kingdoms: Mellow Hills, Evernight, Heaven's Peak, the Golden Halls, and the Ruborian Desert. Access to each abyss is via a portal, which opens once a kingdom has been successfully conquered and the previous ruler banished to a personal hell within. However it's not just the fallen heroes that have been dragged into the abyss: the Overlord's newly loyal peasants have also been taken down into hell too. Do you have what it takes to be really, really, really evil?\n\nFind out in this fun mixture of fantasy role-playing, action, and adventure with just a little pinch of RTS!\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nGOTHIC 1, 2, 3\nIN COLD BLOOD\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULLFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nDon't Starve\nKing of Dragon Pass\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37ac4eb49a0f760c334644a53155bf97aa2ae456","amp;dn":"Overlord+%2B+Raising+Hell+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37ac4eb49a0f760c334644a53155bf97aa2ae456","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,172,78,180,154,15,118,12,51,70,68,165,49,85,191,151,170,42,228,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
