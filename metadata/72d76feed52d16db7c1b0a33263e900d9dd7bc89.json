Unlike other language packs floating around, it actually removes the limitations and restores the language choice functionality found in the complete international version. The pack is compatible with the current DLC, and probably will be compatible with future DLCs and patches. It might work on other game versions with limited language options, too. However, it contains subtitles ONLY and DOES NOT add any voiceover options.\n\nInstallation instructions:\n\n1. Extract the archive contents into Mass Effect 3 installation folder, overwriting the existing files. Default installation paths are:\nC:Program FilesElectronic ArtsMass Effect 3 (for 32-bit systems)\nC:Program Files (x86)Electronic ArtsMass Effect 3 (for 64-bit systems)\n\n2. Select the preferred subtitle language through the in-game menu.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72d76feed52d16db7c1b0a33263e900d9dd7bc89","amp;dn":"Mass+Effect+3+International+Language+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72d76feed52d16db7c1b0a33263e900d9dd7bc89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,215,111,238,213,45,22,219,124,27,10,51,38,62,144,13,157,215,188,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
