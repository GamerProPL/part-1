However, these skills apply equally well to almost any sized project, be it a small toy / model or doing fabrication and invention.  Each book contains the information and projects to follow which will teach the reader those skills.\n\nSome of books from the series are unfortunately missing in the torrent.  I've tried to hunt them down, both online, in the library, and to purchase.  As I find them, I'll put them up for DL so watch my other torrents in you are interested in this series or comment on any you particularly want/need and I'll see if I can put those toward the top of my work queue.\n\nTorrent contents:\n01 - Hardening, Tempering, And Heat Treatment.pdf\t  8.43 MiB\n02 - Vertical Milling in the Home Workshop.pdf\t\t 17.44 MiB\n03 - Screwcutting In The Lathe.pdf\t\t\t125.75 MiB\n04 - Foundrywork For The Amateur.pdf\t\t\t  5.62 MiB\n05 - Milling Operations In The Lathe.pdf\t\t 29.22 MiB\n06 - Measuring and Marking Metals.pdf\t\t\t 26.57 MiB\n07 - The Art of Welding.pdf\t\t\t\t  5.52 MiB\n08 - Sheet Metal Work.pdf\t\t\t\t 31.02 MiB\n09 - Soldering and Brazing.pdf\t\t\t\t  9.89 MiB\n10 - Saws and Sawing.pdf\t\t\t\t 18.35 MiB\n11 - Electroplating.pdf\t\t\t\t\t  3.9  MiB\n12 - Drills, taps and dies.pdf\t\t\t\t 21.05 MiB\n13 - Workshop Drawing.pdf\t\t\t\t  5.25 MiB\n14 - Making Small Workshop Tools.pdf\t\t\t 19.17 MiB\n15 - Workholding in the lathe.pdf\t\t\t 27.95 MiB\n16 - Electric Motors.pdf\t\t\t\t  8.47 MiB\n17 - Gears and gear cutting.pdf\t\t\t\t  8.86 MiB\n18 - Basic Benchwork.pdf\t\t\t\t 26.2  MiB\n19 - Spring Design Manufacture.pdf\t\t\t  4.05 MiB\n20 - Metalwork and machining hints and tips (2).pdf\t 17.34 MiB\n20 - Metalwork and machining Hints and Tips.pdf\t\t  2.11 MiB\n21 - Adhesives and Sealants.pdf\t\t\t\t 19.22 MiB\n22 - Workshop Electrics.pdf\t\t\t\t 11.6  MiB\n24 - Electric Motors in the Home Workshop.pdf\t\t  8.33 MiB\n26 - Home Workshop Hints and Tips.pdf\t\t\t 27.1  MiB\n27 - Spindles.pdf\t\t\t\t\t 10.6  MiB\n28 - Simple Workshop Devices.pdf\t\t\t 35.21 MiB\n30 - Workshop Materials.pdf\t\t\t\t 37.19 MiB\n31 - Useful Workshop Tools.pdf\t\t\t\t 21.15 MiB\n32 - Unimat III Lathe Accessories.pdf\t\t\t 18.79 MiB\n33 - Making Clocks.pdf\t\t\t\t\t  8.36 MiB\n34 - Lathework, a complete course.pdf\t\t\t 33.91 MiB\n35 - Milling A Complete Course.pdf\t\t\t 12.55 MiB\n37 - Dividing.pdf\t\t\t\t\t  6.45 MiB\n38 - Tool and Cutter Sharpening.pdf\t\t\t 30.09 MiB\nTorrent downloaded from\t \t\t\t\t 47.0  B\nWorkshop Practice Series_books.pdf\t\t\t660.37 KiB\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal Torrent Size:  \t\t\t\t\t703.34 MiB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5feafa6a683ed889db0f7c398a542c092b751d79","amp;dn":"Workshop_Practice_Series-Machinists-Mill_Lathe_Foundry_Metalwork","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5feafa6a683ed889db0f7c398a542c092b751d79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,234,250,106,104,62,216,137,219,15,124,57,138,84,44,9,43,117,29,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
