Kruspe, the lead guitarist of the Neue Deutsche HÃƒÂ¤rte band Rammstein.\n\n\nEMIGRATE, will release its sophomore album, &quot;Silent So Long&quot;, on October 21 via Spinefarm. The CD, which was produced by the EMIGRATE bandmembers themselves and mixed in February/March by Ben Grosse (MARILYN MANSON, DISTURBED), features guest appearances by Lemmy Kilmister (MOTÃƒâ€“RHEAD), Jonathan Davis (KORN), Marilyn Manson, Canadian born Berlin-dweller Peaches, and Frank DellÃƒÂ© from chart-topping German collective SEEED.\n\n\nAs with the debut, Kruspe adds to his guitar playing/songwriting duties by stepping up to the mic.\n\n&quot;I didn't write the songs with specific guests in mind,&quot; explains Kruspe, &quot;I just thought who would do the best job on this or that track, and the final performances were everything I was hoping for. You know, I've had about five moments in my music career when I've been left smiling like a child Ã¢â‚¬â€ one was when RAMMSTEIN sold out New York's Madison Square Garden in 20 minutes (2010), but the last one was hearing Lemmy on tape. It just sounds fucking great! I wrote him a really long message and he came back, 'Alright!' Fantastic!&quot;\n\n\nFor Kruspe, still firmly ensconced within the RAMMSTEIN ranks, EMIGRATE has never been a side or a solo project. Preferring to tap into the energy of a team, and looking to revive the collaborative spirit of the East German punk scene he grew from, the guitarist has always put value on those around him, and this time Ã¢â‚¬â€ in addition to the existing personnel of guitarist/producer Olson Involtini and bassist/co-conspirator Arnaud Giroux Ã¢â‚¬â€ he's joined by drummers Mikko SirÃƒÂ©n (APOCALYPTICA) and Joe Letz (COMBICHRIST).\n\nWhile &quot;Emigrate&quot; saw Kruspe, a restless creative spirit, proving that he could take on a new set of challenges, the follow-up adds fresh layers in terms of invention, emotion and contemporary sheen, with Margaux Bossieux Ã¢â‚¬â€ previously of New York punk band DIRTY MARY Ã¢â‚¬â€ providing telling backing vocals throughout; crafted with care in Kruspe's own Berlin studio plus the old radio building on the city's Nalepa Street, the latter enhanced by an extra control room's worth of gear (!), &quot;Silent So Long&quot; is another bold step forward, with both music and (English) lyrics showing no desire to be corralled, and Kruspe the guitarist happy to let rip where the music demands.\n\n\nSays Kruspe: &quot;For me, it was important to reach a new level of songwriting, singing and production, and I can honestly say we made it.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nDiscography:\nEmigrate (2007)\nSilent So Long (2014)  \t\n\n\n\nLine-Up:\nRichard Z.
