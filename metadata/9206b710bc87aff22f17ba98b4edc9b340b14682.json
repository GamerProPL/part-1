In CODE, they show us the ingenious ways we manipulate language and invent new means of communicating with each other. And through CODE, we see how this ingenuity and our very human compulsion to communicate have driven the technological innovations of the past two centuries.\n\nUsing everyday objects and familiar language systems such as Braille and Morse code, author Charles Petzold weaves an illuminating narrative for anyone whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever wondered about the secret inner life of computers and other smart machines.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a cleverly illustrated and eminently comprehensible storyÃ¢â‚¬â€and along the way, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve gained a real context for understanding todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world of PCs, digital media, and the Internet. No matter what your level of technical savvy, CODE will charm youÃ¢â‚¬â€and perhaps even awaken the technophile within.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9206b710bc87aff22f17ba98b4edc9b340b14682","amp;dn":"Code+The+Hidden+Language+of+Computer+Hardware+and+Software+by+Ch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9206b710bc87aff22f17ba98b4edc9b340b14682","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,6,183,16,188,135,175,242,47,23,186,152,180,237,201,179,64,177,70,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
