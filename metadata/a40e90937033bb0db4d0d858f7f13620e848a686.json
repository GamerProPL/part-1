Welcome to the Food Freedom plan.[/u]\r\n\r\nMillions of people have successfully completed the groundbreaking Whole30 program and radically transformed their energy, sleep, cravings, waistline, and health. Now, Food Freedom Forever offers real solutions for anyone stuck in the exhausting cycle of yo-yo dieting and the resulting stress, weight gain, uncontrollable cravings, and health complaints. In her newest book, best-selling author Melissa Hartwig defines true â€œfood freedomâ€ as being in control of the food you eat, instead of food controlling you. Resets like the Whole30 can jump-start the process, but as anyone who has dieted knows, holding onto that freedom and creating healthy habits that last is the hard part. In her detailed 3-part plan, Melissa will help you discover food freedom, no matter how out of control you feel; walk a self-directed path that keeps you in control for months on end; gracefully recover when you slip back into old habits; and create the kind of food freedom that stays with you for the rest of your life.\r\n\r\nFood Freedom Forever shows you how to design your reset, making your short-term protocol maximally effective. Youâ€™ll learn how to spot your specific triggers before theyâ€™re pulled and strategies for dealing with temptation, strengthening your new healthy habits, and boosting your willpower. Melissa also shares advice for retaining your food freedom during holidays, vacations, periods of life stress, social pressure, and criticism from friends and family. By the last page, youâ€™ll have a detailed plan for creating the perfect diet for you, finding your own healthy balance, and maintaining the kind of control that brings you real food freedom every day.[/b][/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a40e90937033bb0db4d0d858f7f13620e848a686","amp;dn":"Food+Freedom+Forever+-+Letting+Go+of+Bad+Habits%2C+Guilt%2C+and+Anxi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a40e90937033bb0db4d0d858f7f13620e848a686","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,14,144,147,112,51,187,13,180,208,216,88,247,241,54,32,232,72,166,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
