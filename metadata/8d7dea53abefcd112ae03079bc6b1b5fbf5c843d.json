With Task Drivers, you can easily trace critical paths in project plans to find the root cause of a particular delay.\n\nReverse changes\nExperiment with what-if scenarios by using Multiple Level Undo. This enables you to undo and redo changes to views, data, and options. You can undo actions or sets of actions from macros or compliant, third-party customizations to fully understand the implications of each change.\n\nSee the effects of a change\nDetermine the impact of a change on all other dependent tasks with Change Highlights. Project automatically highlights all items that shift as a result of the most recent change you make.\n\nControl project finances\nAssign budgets to projects and programs to allocate funds and track costs.\n\nAssign costs to tasks\nAssign multiple arbitrary costs (not based on work time) with the new Cost resource type. Also, new fields for cost information enable better project accounting. You can more accurately monitor project financials and keep your project in sync with data in your accounting system. \n\nEffectively Communicate Project-Related Information\nCommunicate your progress and issues effectively with Office Project 2007.\n\nUse predefined reports\nSelect, preview, and print the most frequently used information needed to manage projects, track resources, maintain costs, and communicate progress to your team. You can also adapt these reports to present the specific information you want to display.\n\nUse Project views to convey information\nUpdated views and visual capabilities allow for better reports. The Background Cell Highlighting feature enables you to change the color of a cell or row to convey additional meaning.\n\nCapitalize on charts and diagrams\nEasily create charts in Microsoft Office Excel 2007 or 2003 and diagrams in Microsoft Office Visio Professional 2007 of your project data with the Visual Reports feature. This feature creates report templates that may be reused with different projects. These reports support PivotTable views versus the static snapshots of Project information that the Copy Picture to Office Wizard creates in Excel, Microsoft Office Word, or Microsoft Office PowerPoint.\n\nGet Productive Quickly\nEasily assign resources, control finances, and help improve cost estimation.\n\nFollow the Project Guide\nLearn to use Project by following the Project Guide, an interactive step-by-step planning aid that helps you quickly master the project management process.\n\nSave time with project templates\nProject provides many out-of-the-box templates to help speed the project creation process. A Project template prepopulates task and resource information, formatting, macros, and other project-specific settings. You can send templates to other users via e-mail to share best practices and create consistency. You can also download additional templates from the evolving Microsoft Office Online gallery.\n\nCreate your own template\nTake advantage of your own best practices by creating your own custom templates. This enables you to reuse an existing project as the basis for future projects.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere is an activation method in the instructions however if you have no phone or do not want to phone then use this method; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5158216&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5158216&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTo use .iso files download this; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/Power%20iso%20%5Bthethingy%5D/0/99/300&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/Power%20iso%20%5Bthethingy%5D/0/99/300&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Office 2007 range;   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/Microsoft%20Office%202007%20%5Bthethingy%5D/0/99/300&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/Microsoft%20Office%202007%20%5Bthethingy%5D/0/99/300&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMicrosoft Office 2010 range;       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/Microsoft%20Office%202010%20%5Bthethingy%5D/0/99/300&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/Microsoft%20Office%202010%20%5Bthethingy%5D/0/99/300&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d7dea53abefcd112ae03079bc6b1b5fbf5c843d","amp;dn":"MICROSOFT+OFFICE+PROJECT+PROFESSIONAL+2007+%5Bthethingy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d7dea53abefcd112ae03079bc6b1b5fbf5c843d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,125,234,83,171,239,205,17,42,224,48,121,188,107,27,95,191,92,132,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
