This, ironically, winds up as considerably less cohesive than its predecessor despite these efforts for community, not because Wings was not a band in the proper sense, but because nobody else in the band pulled as much weight as McCartney, who was resting on his laurels here. Consider this: The two hits Ã¢â‚¬Å“Let Ã¢â‚¬ËœEm InÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Silly Love SongsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are so lightweight that their lack of substance seems nearly defiant. They have sweet, nice melodies and are well-crafted, but as songs theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re nonexistent, working primarily as effervescent popcraft of their time. And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the case for most of At the Speed of Sound, as tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s My BabyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ play like the hits, only without memorable hooks. There is a bit of charm to the record, arriving in LindaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s awkwardly sung Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cook of the House,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the mellow Ã¢â‚¬Å“Must Do Something About It,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and especially Ã¢â‚¬Å“Beware My Love,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the best-written song here that effortlessly moves from sun-drenched harmonies to hard rock. Apart from the latter, these are modest pleasures, buried on an album that may have been a chart-topping blockbuster, but now seems like one of McCartneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most transient works.\n\n\n\nAt half the length of the generous 14-track Venus &amp; Mars supplemental disc, the extra CD added to the 2014 Paul McCartney Archives reissue of Wings at the Speed of Sound feels a little lightweight in comparison. Truth is, there wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t much in the vaults to be put on this disc. There were no non-LP singles along the lines of Ã¢â‚¬Å“JuniorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s FarmÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Walking in the Park with Eloise,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ for that matter), all the recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singles featured album tracks as B-sides, any recordings from the accompanying tour showed up on the live Wings Over America triple-LP released just nine months later, and apart from a 24-second clip of McCartney fooling around with a voice synthesizer (included here as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Message to JoeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), there werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t unheard songs left behind. That leaves the six songs on the supplemental At the Speed of Sound as demos of one sort or another. Apart from Ã¢â‚¬Å“Beware My LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€œ billed as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“John Bonham Version,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the big-boned pulse of the Zeppelin is felt nearly as strongly as McCartney conducting the band by calling out transitions, proof that this wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t close to being a finished track Ã¢â‚¬â€ and maybe Ã¢â‚¬Å“Must Do Something About It,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ where PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocal feels like a guide for eventual singer Joe English, these all feel like demos. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Warm and BeautifulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is nothing more than an instrumental, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Silly Love SongsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is spare with Paul accompanied by just a piano and Linda, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Let Ã¢â‚¬ËœEm InÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is lively but spare and muffled (the percussion, harmony, and piano arrangement is quite fun), as is Ã¢â‚¬Å“SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s My Baby.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fun to hear Paul Ã¢â‚¬â€ and despite the appearance of Linda here and there, this is quite thoroughly his show Ã¢â‚¬â€ so stripped down, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also something that amounts to the kind of archival listen thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spun not regularly but as a curiosity.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bfc01d4a791be65697fad30ca4a93e353d017f4","amp;dn":"Paul+McCartney+%26amp%3B+Wings+-+Wings+at+the+Speed+of+Sound+%5BDeluxe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bfc01d4a791be65697fad30ca4a93e353d017f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,252,1,212,167,145,190,101,105,127,173,48,202,74,147,227,83,208,23,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
