Dubbing itself a cross between Sun-Tzu's The Art of War and Julie Cameron's The Artist's Way, Pressfield's book aims to help readers &quot;overcome Resistance&quot; so that they may achieve &quot;the unlived life within.&quot; Whether one wishes to embark on a diet, a program of spiritual advancement or an entrepreneurial venture, it's most often resistance that blocks the way. To kick resistance, Pressfield stresses loving what one does, having patience and acting in the face of fear.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33bd1c0aaaa28ae6701146e34ed58e8d71c5f958","amp;dn":"The+War+of+Art+-+Steven+Pressfield","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33bd1c0aaaa28ae6701146e34ed58e8d71c5f958","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,189,28,10,170,162,138,230,112,17,70,227,78,213,142,141,113,197,249,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
