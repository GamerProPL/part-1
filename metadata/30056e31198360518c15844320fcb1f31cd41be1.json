Colin Campbell, Ph.D. and Thomas M. Campbell | ISBN: 1932100660 | PDF | 425 pages | 5.4 MB\n\n\nThe China Study is part diet, part medical study, part condemnation of the governmental and industry politics that determine what we think about what we eat.\n\nThis exhaustive presentation of the findings from The China Study conclusively demonstrates the link between nutrition and heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Referred to as the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGrand Prix of epidemiologyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by the New York Times, this study reveals the dramatic effect proper nutrition can have on reducing and reversing these ailments as well as obesity and calls into question the practices of many of the current dietary programs, such as the Atkins diet, that enjoy widespread popularity in the western world.\n\nAbout the Authors\nFor more than 40 years, Dr. T. Colin Campbell has been at the forefront of nutrition research. His legacy, the China Study, is the most comprehensive study of health and nutrition ever conducted.
