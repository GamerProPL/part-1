You are about to. Universe Sandbox takes the joyous freeplay of Powder and such into 3D. Astronomical scales are laid out for you with a fully zooming and rotatable camera, trails tie knots and stream like ribbons, light waves pulsate at remarkably slow speeds, time is at your command. You can throw a star through the asteroid belt and see what happens. It brings out the awed child in all of us.\n\nCreate and destroy on a scale youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve never imagined with the ultimate space simulator.\nHarness the power to create black holes, collide galaxies, and manipulate gravity with just a few clicks. Inspired by the software astronomers use to unlock the mysteries of our universe, never before has astronomy been so interactive or so much fun.\nSpawn a massive moon to tear apart SaturnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rings or launch a rogue star to rip the planets from their orbits around our sun. After unleashing catastrophic destruction, create your own solar system and share it with friends.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img.nattawat.org/images/sxxwnswbxr5d1ya0xx2m.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img.nattawat.org/images/sxxwnswbxr5d1ya0xx2m.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFeatures:\n~Interactive, real-time, n-body gravity simulator\n~Change any property of any object at any time\n~Real physics, real data, real units, real science\n~Compare the objects in any simulation with chart mode\n~Supports anaglyphic 3D glasses and 3D DLP televisions\n~Built in tutorials and step-by-step activities\n~Includes 70+ simulations both real and fantastical\n~Extensive editing and creation tools make it easy to build your own simulations\n\nPublisher: Giant Army\nDeveloper: Giant Army\nGenre: Simulation, Indie, Casual, Family\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img.nattawat.org/images/rpsmjdv1l8pj6s0j31wg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img.nattawat.org/images/rpsmjdv1l8pj6s0j31wg.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://universesandbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Impact-Universe-Sandbox-20110304-152025-19305-e1299280898151.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://universesandbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Impact-Universe-Sandbox-20110304-152025-19305-e1299280898151.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img269.imageshack.us/img269/9427/1259607472emuworldnfo.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img269.imageshack.us/img269/9427/1259607472emuworldnfo.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f931bfeded36b5271f59fa5d3272b7f08a4ff35","amp;dn":"Universe+Sandbox+RIP-Unleashed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f931bfeded36b5271f59fa5d3272b7f08a4ff35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,147,27,254,222,211,107,82,113,245,159,165,211,39,43,127,8,164,255,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
