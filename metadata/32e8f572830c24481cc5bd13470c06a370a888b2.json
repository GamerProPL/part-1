But the rest of the album is hardly less impressive. &quot;Each One Dub,&quot; another cut on a Jacob Miller rhythm, possesses the same dark and mystical ambience, if not quite the same emotional energy, as &quot;King Tubbys Meets Rockers Uptown,&quot; and the version of the epochal &quot;Satta Massaganna&quot; that closes the album is another solid winner. Pablo's trademark &quot;Far East&quot; sound (characterized by minor keys and prominent melodica lines) is predominant throughout, and is treated with care and grace by King Tubby, who has rarely sounded more inspired in his studio manipulations than he does here. \n\n\nAbsolutely essential. \n \n\n\n\nAUGUSTUS PABLO\n\nKing Tubbys Meets Rockers Uptown     1976\n\n\n- CD\n- 2004\n- Deluxe Edition\n- Bonus Tracks\n- 320Kbps\n\n\nAugustus Pablo, melodica, piano, clavinet, organ\nRobbie Shakespeare, bass\nAston Barrett, bass\nLeroy Sibbles, Bass\nCarlton Barrett, drums\nEarl Smith, guitar\nRichard Hall, saxophone\nBobby Ellis, trumpet\nVincent Gordon, trombone\n\n\n\nMixed by King Tubby and Errol Thompson at King Tubby's Studio, Kingston, Jamaica\n\n\n\nAdded to the 2004 reissue of the album are four bonus tracks taken from Jamaican singles and are based around tracks on the Rockers Uptown rhythms: &quot;Black Gunn&quot; is a version of &quot;Keep On Dubbing&quot;, &quot;1 Ruthland Close&quot; is a different take on &quot;555 Dub St.&quot;, &quot;1-2-3 Version&quot; is a re-working of the record's title track and &quot;Silent Satta&quot; is a version of &quot;Satta Dub&quot;.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32e8f572830c24481cc5bd13470c06a370a888b2","amp;dn":"Augustus+Pablo-King+Tubbys+Meets+Rockers+Uptown+1976++%27Deluxe+Ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32e8f572830c24481cc5bd13470c06a370a888b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,232,245,114,131,12,36,72,28,197,189,19,71,12,6,163,112,168,136,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
