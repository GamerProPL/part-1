But the criminal doesn't crave money or powerâ€”he only wants to ask the elite if they know the price others pay for their luxurious lifestyles. And, if they don't, he corrects their ignoranceâ€”by killing them.\r\n\r\nTo Detective Michael Bennett, it becomes clear that these murders are linked and must be part of a greater, more public demonstration. With the city thrown into chaos, he is forced to team up with FBI agent Emily Parker, and the two set out to capture the killer before he begins his most public lesson yetâ€”a deadly message for the entire city to witness.\r\n\r\nFrom the best-selling author who brought you the Alex Cross novels comes James Patterson's most action-packed series yet. With the heart-pounding suspense that only Patterson delivers, Worst Case will leave you gasping for breath until the very end","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aad77d2b79b4c322f2f625dcb0ae07892705c73","amp;dn":"James+Patterson-Worst+Case","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aad77d2b79b4c322f2f625dcb0ae07892705c73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,173,119,210,183,155,76,50,47,47,98,93,203,10,224,120,146,112,92,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
