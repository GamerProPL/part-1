The set includes cadenzas by Mozart himself, Ashkenazy, and even one by Beethoven. I personally rather enjoy Ashkenazy's playing of anything, but particularly these concertos.\n\nI've ripped the CDs to individual tracks, however, I've still maintained the original track order for each of the CDs. In addition, I've also included log files, scans of the covers &amp; a 31-page booklet (in English and en Francais), and, as with all of my previous uploads, ensured that all files are tagged properly.\n\nHope you enjoy -- unless you're a leecher, in which case I hope something large runs over you! ;)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1160daaf9efb1c9a9bda8df0740a92067b52cd0e","amp;dn":"Mozart+-+Complete+Piano+Concertos+-+Vladimir+Ashkenazy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1160daaf9efb1c9a9bda8df0740a92067b52cd0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,96,218,175,158,251,28,154,155,218,141,240,116,10,146,6,123,82,205,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
