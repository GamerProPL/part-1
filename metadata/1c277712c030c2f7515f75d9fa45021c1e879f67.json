There's a coolness in their relationship and aspects of Naples add to the strain. She remembers a poet who loved her and died in the war; although she didn't love him, the memory underscores romance's absence from her life now. She tours the museums of Naples and Pompeii, immersing herself in the Neapolitan fascination with the dead and noticing how many women are pregnant; he idles on Capri, flirting with women but drawing back from adultery. With her, he's sarcastic; with him, she's critical. They talk of divorce. Will this foreign couple find insight and direction in Italy? \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c277712c030c2f7515f75d9fa45021c1e879f67","amp;dn":"Journey+to+Italy+%281954%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c277712c030c2f7515f75d9fa45021c1e879f67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,39,119,18,192,48,194,247,81,95,117,217,250,69,2,28,30,135,159,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
