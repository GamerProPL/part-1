By examining the prehistoric origins of human sexual behavior the authors are able to expose the fallacies and weaknesses of standard theories proposed by most experts. This is a provocative, entertaining, and pioneering book. I learned a lot from it and recommend it highly.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ Andrew Weil, M.D.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Sex at Dawn irrefutably shows that what is obviousÃ¢â‚¬â€that human beings, both male and female, are lustfulÃ¢â‚¬â€is true, and has always been soÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. The more dubious its evidentiary basis and lack of connection with current reality, the more ardently the scientific inevitability of monogamy is maintainedÃ¢â‚¬â€even as it falls away around us.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ Stanton Peele, Ph.D.\n\nA controversial, idea-driven book that challenges everything you (think you) know about sex, monogamy, marriage, and family. In the words of Steve Taylor (The Fall, Waking From Sleep), Sex at Dawn is Ã¢â‚¬Å“a wonderfully provocative and well-written book which completely re-evaluates human sexual behavior and gets to the root of many of our social and psychological ills.&quot;\n\n\nHow to Open EPUB Files?\n\nMOZILLA FIREFOX\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/epubreader/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/epubreader/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOR\n\nCHROME BROWSER\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/magicscroll-ebook-reader/ghgnmgfdoiplfmhgghbmlphanpfmjble&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/magicscroll-ebook-reader/ghgnmgfdoiplfmhgghbmlphanpfmjble&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n          Support the Editors &amp; Buy the Book If you Like it \n                        \nScreen:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/OALMdAaEP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/OALMdAaEP&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n           --As Eternity has reckoned There's a lifetime in a second--\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n*Seed as long you can(1:1 ratio is appreciated)\n*If you don't like what you see then don't download.Simple\n*Don't hit and run.Most of these torrents will not be greater than 100MB in size\n*Quality will be top notch regardless of file size be it Videos or Pictures\n*Any torrent which needs seeding kindly comment in that section\n*Visit my uploads @    &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Orion_Me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Orion_Me/&lt;/a&gt;     &amp;\n*Comments are always welcome \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ebbe8624115d831b2865da6100082b199ac84b6","amp;dn":"Sex+At+Dawn%3AHow+We+Mate%2C+Why+We+Stray+and+What+It+Means+for+Mode","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ebbe8624115d831b2865da6100082b199ac84b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,187,232,98,65,21,216,49,178,134,93,166,16,0,130,177,153,172,132,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
