Each half hour follows the misadventures of Jerri Blank, a 46 year old high school dropout who has spent the last 32 years in and out of prison - a self described &quot;boozer, user and loser.&quot; Strangers with Candy commences as Jerri decides to pick up her life exactly where she left it: living at home and starting ninth grade. Faced with classic high school dilemmas every week, Jerri's old habits - as well as the misguided advice of her self-centered teachers - cause her to resolve each crisis by learning the wrong lesson from every scenario.\n\n\nVIDEO\nCodec: AVC (x264)\nProfile: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5911303e3119156a7769&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; with CABAC and 5 refs\nBitrate: ~800 Kbps\nResolution: 640x480 (4:3)\nFramerate: 29.970 fps\nRuntime: ~22 min per episode\n\nAUDIO\nCodec: AAC\nMixdown: Dolby Pro Logic II\nBitrate: 160 Kbps\nChannels: 2 (Stereo)\nLanguage: English\n\n\nENCODING NOTE: Some episodes in Season 1 were shot on very grainy film, which affected the encode quality.\n\nPLAYBACK NOTE: This video can be played on any computer using VideoLAN VLC Media Player.
