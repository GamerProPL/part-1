A detective drama, it focuses on the main character of Detective Chief Inspector John Barnaby, played by Neil Dudgeon. Prior to 2011, the chief character was DCI Tom Barnaby, elder cousin of the current character, who left the series when actor John Nettles decided to give up the role. The stories revolve around Barnaby\\'s efforts to solve the numerous crimes that take place in the fictional English county of Midsomer, assisted by successive Detective Sergeants - DS Gavin Troy (Daniel Casey), DS Dan Scott (John Hopkins), and DS Ben Jones (Jason Hughes). It is based on a series of crime novels by the author Caroline Graham and was previously adapted by Anthony Horowitz.\n\nInitial filming of Midsomer Murders was undertaken in autumn 1996 with the first episodes transmitted in the United Kingdom on March 23, 1997. Viewing figures for the series are healthy, and the feature-length drama attracts a number of actors from the stage and screen in guest-starring roles. The majority of the early episodes were adapted by Anthony Horowitz from the original Caroline Graham works. Horowitz and the original producers Betty Willingale and Brian True-May, created the series. Current writers include David Lawrence, Michael Aitkens and David Hoskins.\n\nIn early 2009, John Nettles announced he would retire after the 13th series of 10 episodes, at the end of 2010. Neil Dudgeon replaced him in the 14th series playing Barnaby\\'s cousin DCI John Barnaby. The character is first seen in the episode \\'The Sword of Guillaume\\'\\&quot;\nSource: Wikipedia\n\n\nIncluding:\n1. COMPLETE episode compilation of season 1-13. All episodes DVDrips and HDTVrips. A total of 81 episodes.\n2. Episode guide\n3. Soundtrack (27 songs in 128 kbps mp3)\n\nComposed by Jim Parker, the soundtrack is performed (though not exclusively) with an unusual electronic musical instrument: the theremin. The theme is a moderate-tempo waltz that would sound quite pleasant on a more normal instrument, such as a violin or piano, but sounds quite eerie on the theremin, which was used in some mid 20th-century horror films and also for the theme tune of the original Star Trek series.\nSource: Wikipedia\n\n\n4.
