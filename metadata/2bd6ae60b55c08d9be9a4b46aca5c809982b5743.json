The outtakes have been newly mixed (by engineer Matt Ross-Spang) at Sam Phillips Recording in Memphis, Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThese tracks were originally â€˜executive producedÃ¢Â€â„¢ by Elvis with producer Felton Jarvis and The King was backed by many members of his longtime touring band including: James Burton (guitar), Ronnie Tutt (drums), David Briggs (keyboards), Glenn D. Hardin (keyboards), Jerry Scheff (bass), Norbert Putnam (bass) and J.D. Sumner &amp; the Stamps (vocals).\r\n\r\nTracks on this new compilation have been released before on albums such as From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee (1976) and the Moody Blue album. The latter also featured some live material and included the posthumous hit single Way Down (a track that appears on Way Down In The Jungle Room twice).\r\n\r\nThe newly mixed Outtakes disc features the always fascinating in-the-studio-dialogue and they are sequenced in the order they were recorded (with the exception of track 13, She Thinks I Still Care).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2CD Edition\r\n\r\nDISC 1 â€“ THE MASTERS\r\n\r\n01 Way Down (2:38)\r\n02 She Thinks I Still Care (3:51)\r\n03 Bitter They Are, Harder They Fall (3:17)\r\n04 Pledging My Love (2:51)\r\n05 For The Heart (3:22)\r\n06 Love Coming Down (3:07)\r\n07 HeÃ¢Â€â„¢ll Have To Go (4:32)\r\n08 Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain (3:41)\r\n09 Hurt (2:07)\r\n10 Never Again (2:51)\r\n11 Danny Boy (3:56)\r\n12 Solitaire (4:40)\r\n13 Moody Blue (2:49)\r\n14 ItÃ¢Â€â„¢s Easy For You (3:27)\r\n15 IÃ¢Â€â„¢ll Never Fall In Love Again (3:44)\r\n16 The Last Farewell (4:02)\r\n\r\nTracks 1-2, 4, 7 and 13-14 from Moody Blue (RCA AFL1-2428, 1977)\r\nTracks 3, 5-6, 8-12 and 15-16 from From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee (RCA APL1-1506, 1976)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISC 2 â€“ THE OUTTAKES\r\n\r\n01 Bitter They Are, Harder They Fall â€“ take 1 (5:15)\r\n02 She Thinks I Still Care â€“ take 10 (6:30)\r\n03 The Last Farewell â€“ take 2 (4:15)\r\n04 Solitaire â€“ take 7 (5:37)\r\n05 IÃ¢Â€â„¢ll Never Fall In Love Again â€“ take 5 (4:04)\r\n06 Moody Blue â€“ take1 (3:53)\r\n07 For The Heart â€“ take 1 (3:55)\r\n08 Hurt â€“ take 3 (2:30)\r\n09 Danny Boy â€“ take 9 (4:02)\r\n10 Never Again â€“ take 9 â€“ 3:56\r\n11 Love Coming Down â€“ take 3 (3:17)\r\n12 Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain â€“ take 4 (4:59)\r\n13 She Thinks I Still Care â€“ (alternate version) take 2 (4:26)\r\n14 ItÃ¢Â€â„¢s Easy For You â€“ take 1 â€“ (5:24)\r\n15 Way Down â€“ take 2 â€“ 3:50\r\n16 Pledging My Love â€“ take 3 (5:34)\r\n17 For The Heart â€“ take 4 (4:13)\r\n\r\nTracks 1, 4, 7, 9, 11-12 and 17 from From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee (Follow That Dream Records 506020-975046, 2012)\r\nTracks 2, 6 and 16 from Moody Blue (Follow That Dream Records 506020-975052, 2013)\r\nTracks 3, 5, 8, and 13-15 from The Jungle Room Sessions (Follow That Dream Records 74321 74931-2, 2000\r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wN6Z\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wN6Y","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bd6ae60b55c08d9be9a4b46aca5c809982b5743","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Way+Down+In+The+Jungle+Room+%282016%29+FLAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bd6ae60b55c08d9be9a4b46aca5c809982b5743","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,214,174,96,181,92,8,217,190,154,75,70,172,165,200,9,152,43,87,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
