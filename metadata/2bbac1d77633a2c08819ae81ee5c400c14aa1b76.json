It was a major hit, as was its soundtrack, which spent a grand total of ten weeks at number one and sold over seven million copies. It&amp;#039;s easy to see why -- the album delivers its mainstream pop, anthemic rock, and light dance-pop with style and an abundance of hooks. Six of the nine tracks became Top 40 hits, and three -- Kenny Loggins&amp;#039; bouncy title song, the excellent power ballad &quot;Almost Paradise&quot; (a duet between Loverboy&amp;#039;s Mike Reno and Heart&amp;#039;s Ann Wilson), and Deniece Williams&amp;#039; frothy, charming &quot;Let&amp;#039;s Hear It for the Boy&quot; -- shot into the Top Ten. The sound and production of Footloose has dated badly -- there is a reliance on synthesizers and drum machines that instantly announces that the record was made in 1984 -- but that isn&amp;#039;t necessarily a weakness. Not only does it function as a time capsule of a certain moment in pop music history, but many of the songs are catchy enough to transcend their production. There&amp;#039;s nothing of substance on the Footloose soundtrack, but it&amp;#039;s a light, entertaining listen. Sometimes, that can be better than something substantial.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01 - Footloose - Kenny Loggins  [3:47]\n02 - Let&amp;#039;s Hear It for the Boy - Deniece Williams  [4:20]\t \n03 - Almost Paradise - Ann Wilson, Mike Reno  [3:51]\n04 - Holding Out for a Hero - Bonnie Tyler  [5:50]\n05 - Dancing in the Sheets - Shalamar  [4:02]\n06 - I&amp;#039;m Free (Heaven Helps the Man) - Kenny Loggins  [3:46]\n07 - Somebody&amp;#039;s Eyes - Karla Bonoff  [3:33]\n08 - The Girl Gets Around - Sammy Hagar  [3:23]\n09 - Never - Moving Picture  [3:48]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bbac1d77633a2c08819ae81ee5c400c14aa1b76","amp;dn":"Footloose+-+Soundtrack+%281984%29+128kbps+%5BRussTheStalker%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bbac1d77633a2c08819ae81ee5c400c14aa1b76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,186,193,215,118,51,162,192,136,25,174,129,238,92,64,12,20,170,27,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
