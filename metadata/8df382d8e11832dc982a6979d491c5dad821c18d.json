They have recorded rather steadily ever since their debut in 1988, with a few year's break in the late nineties (the band broke in 1994, and Paksi recruited a new lineup in 1998). As their lyrics are entirely in Hungarian, it's unlikely that this band has gotten a lot of exposure outside their homeland, but they have done well for themselves, with a style in the traditional 80's metal style (at times vaguely reminiscient of Scorpions or Iron Maiden, though Paksi's vocals resemble neither).\nArtist: Ossian\n\nAlbum: LÃƒÂ©lekerÃ…â€˜\n\nGenre: Heavy Metal / Power Metal\n\nCountry: Hungary\n\nReleased: 2015\n\nDescription\n\n01.
