I've also added\n\nFuzz, the self titled LP from Fuzz (the band in which Ty Segall drums). And Hair, \n\nthe LP by Ty and White Fence. This collection is not complete, I'm missing Ty \n\nSegall's self titled LP, released in 2008.\n\n\n\n\nThe bit rate for these albums are as high as possible, I couldn't find any better\n\nversions. The bit rate doesn't distract listening anyway, if anything it enhances the \n\nrawness of the recording.\n\n\n\nSTUDIO LP'S (as Ty Segall)\n\n\nHorn the Unicorn (192kbps)(2008)\n\nLemons (200kbps approx)(VBR)(2009\n\nMelted (250kbps approx)(VBR)(2010)\n\nGoodbye Bread (250kbps approx)(VBR)(2011)\n\nSlaughterhouse (320kbps)(2012)\n\nTwins (320kbps)(2012)\n\nSleeper (320kbps)(2013)\n\n\nOTHER ALBUMS\n\nFuzz - Fuzz (320kbps)(2013)\n\nHair - Ty Segall &amp; White Fence (320kbps)(2012)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad8c8d61497f2babbc7c79e04b5a029b2e4fa310","amp;dn":"Ty+Segall+-+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad8c8d61497f2babbc7c79e04b5a029b2e4fa310","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,140,141,97,73,127,43,171,188,124,121,224,75,90,2,155,46,79,163,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
