Will Rick make a bonanza of an offer or ride the deal off into the sunset? Next, a 1900s Wrigley Gum vending machine pops in to the shop. Will Corey double his fun or find it's lost its flavor? Then, a measuring device known as a railroad equilibristat chugs in. Can Rick lay down an offer or will he derail negotiations? And later, a 1960s Jimmy Jet toy zooms in. Will Chum land on a price or will he steer off course?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c59f9c99cab978af5ef1aebf506e1f5390a8ca72","amp;dn":"Pawn+Stars+S13E05+Double+Your+Pawn+WEB-DL+x264-JIVE%5Bstate%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c59f9c99cab978af5ef1aebf506e1f5390a8ca72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,159,156,153,202,185,120,175,94,241,174,191,80,110,31,83,144,168,202,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
