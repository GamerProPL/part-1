Blue Label Software's PDF to Excel Converter falls somewhere in the middle, offering lots of speed and convenience, but at a significant cost, compared to the freeware.\n\n  PDF to Excel Converter's user interface is a nicely rendered variation on a common layout for tools of this type, with a tree view in a sidebar to the left of a file selecting list view, with a similar list view for batch jobs below. We looked for but couldn't find a Help file or even online instructions, but this tool isn't too hard to use: just browse to a folder, add one or more documents, and press Convert. After you've made your selections on the settings wizard, simply press Start. \n\n  You can open finished files directly inside Excel from PDF to Excel Converter, too. Before we started, we reviewed the wizard's Properties and Security tabs. The Properties tab auto-formats cells by default, and we could also select automatic cell size or make manual choices. The Security tab let us set an optional user name and password combination to protect our workbooks. The captions and labels are clear, though a few terms didn't make the change from German to English (the two language choices).\n\n  Features:\n\n-Convert PDF Documents to Excel Documents\n-Render text and images to excel worksheets\n-Setup pdf pages / excel worksheet\n-Creation Excel Documents in single or batch mode\n-No needed other tools or applications for creation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:102bedd2845da06cb606d330d567fb945636ef6d","amp;dn":"Pdf_to_Excel_Converter_3.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"102bedd2845da06cb606d330d567fb945636ef6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,43,237,210,132,93,160,108,182,6,211,48,213,103,251,148,86,54,239,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
