Author Barton Poulson shows how to use R to model statistical relationships using graphs, calculations, tests, and other analysis tools. Learn how to enter and modify data; create charts, scatter plots, and histograms; examine outliers; calculate correlations; and compute regressions, bivariate associations, and statistics for three or more variables. Challenge exercises with step-by-step solutions allow you to test your skills as you progress.\n\nTopics include:\n\n    Installing R on your computer\n    Using the built-in datasets\n    Importing data\n    Creating bar and pie charts for categorical variables\n    Creating histograms and box plots for quantitative variables\n    Calculating frequencies and descriptives\n    Transforming variables\n    Coding missing data\n    Analyzing by subgroups\n    Creating charts for associations\n    Calculating correlations\n    Creating charts and statistics for three or more variables\n    Creating crosstabs for categorical variables\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09636207e7105bc6b7ee2eb0079e1bfbb7bafc79","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+R+Statistics+Essential+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09636207e7105bc6b7ee2eb0079e1bfbb7bafc79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,99,98,7,231,16,91,198,183,238,46,176,7,158,27,251,183,186,252,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
