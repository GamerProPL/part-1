He has written ten novels, spanning the Southern Gothic, Western, and post-apocalyptic genres.  McCarthy has been increasingly mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nHe won the Pulitzer Prize and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction for THE ROAD (2006).  NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (2005) was adapted as a 2007 film of the same name, which won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture.  For ALL THE PRETTY HORSES (1992), he won both the U.S. National Book Award and National Book Critics Circle Award.  Literary critic Harold Bloom called McCarthy one of the four major American novelists of his time, alongside Don DeLillo, Thomas Pynchon and Philip Roth, and described BLOOD MERIDIAN (1985) as &quot;the greatest single book since Faulkner's As I Lay Dying.&quot;\n\n\nIncluded here are the ten novels published to date, two plays, and two screenplays.
