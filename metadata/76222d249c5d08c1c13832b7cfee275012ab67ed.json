His transport takes the form of a bicycle held aloft by a helium balloon the size of a bus, with the pedals driving two propellers. He puts the machine to the test in Bedfordshire's historic Cardington Hangars, where some of the world's biggest flying machines were created, and seeks some military advice on surviving crash landings.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bb/Speed-with-Guy-Martin-Series-3-Pedal-Powered-Airship-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2c/Speed-with-Guy-Martin-Series-3-Pedal-Powered-Airship-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a9/Speed-with-Guy-Martin-Series-3-Pedal-Powered-Airship-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/08/Speed-with-Guy-Martin-Series-3-Pedal-Powered-Airship-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c4/Speed-with-Guy-Martin-Series-3-Pedal-Powered-Airship-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/66/Speed-with-Guy-Martin-Series-3-Pedal-Powered-Airship-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2a/Speed-with-Guy-Martin-Series-3-Pedal-Powered-Airship-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/75/Speed-with-Guy-Martin-Series-3-Pedal-Powered-Airship-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a6/Speed-with-Guy-Martin-Series-3-Pedal-Powered-Airship-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/de/Speed-with-Guy-Martin-Series-3-Pedal-Powered-Airship-Screen9.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video: Bitrate: CRF-22 (~3023 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 72 mins,\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.52 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/tv-programme/e/fc5sgb/speed-with-guy-martin--series-3-episode-2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76222d249c5d08c1c13832b7cfee275012ab67ed","amp;dn":"Ch4+Speed+With+Guy+Martin+Series+3+Pedal+Powered+Airship+720p+x2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76222d249c5d08c1c13832b7cfee275012ab67ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,34,45,36,156,93,8,193,193,56,50,183,207,238,39,80,18,171,103,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
