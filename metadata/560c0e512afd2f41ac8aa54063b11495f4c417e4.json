Older houses lack the open floor plan that allows the kitchen to become part of the living area, while an increasing number of amateur chefs are going beyond the basics to build a kitchen that's worthy of an upscale restaurant.\nThe kitchen has become less utilitarian and more creative--a place where homeowners express their personal style as much as they would in any other room of the house. By that same token, new appliance technology allows for a more useful kitchen, while hiding the pragmatism behind aesthetics--no more avocado and harvest gold refrigeration giants. With all these new possibilities come an overwhelming array of choices and a substantial investment of time and money. Homeowners need guidance, and &quot;New Kitchen Idea Book&quot; will help them discover what they really want and how to achieve it.\n&quot;&quot;New Kitchen Idea Book&quot; provides inspiration for refreshing your kitchen for more enjoyment in both cooking and entertaining.&quot;\n--Chuck Williams, founder of Williams-Sonoma","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:560c0e512afd2f41ac8aa54063b11495f4c417e4","amp;dn":"New+Kitchen+And+Bathroom+Idea+Book+%28Taunton%27s+Ideas+That+Work%29+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"560c0e512afd2f41ac8aa54063b11495f4c417e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,12,14,81,42,253,47,65,172,138,165,64,99,177,20,149,244,196,23,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
