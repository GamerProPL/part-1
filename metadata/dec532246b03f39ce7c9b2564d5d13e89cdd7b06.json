Guitarist Eddie Van Halen redefined what the electric guitar could do, developing a blindingly fast technique with a variety of self-taught two-handed tapping, hammer-ons, pull-offs, and effects that mimicked the sounds of machines and animals. It was wildly inventive and over the top, equaled only by vocalist David Lee Roth, who brought the role of a metal singer to near-performance art standards. Roth wasn't blessed with great technique, unlike Eddie, but he had a flair for showmanship derived as much from lounge performers as Robert Plant. Together, they made Van Halen into the most popular American rock &amp; roll band of the late '70s and early '80s, and in the process set the template for hard rock and heavy metal for the '80s. \n\n\nGenre................: Hard-Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Lossless Audiochecker, Cue\n\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Panama (2015 Remastered)\n02.Best Of Both Worlds (Remastered Album Version)\n03.Jamie's Cryin' (2015 Remastered)\n04.Runaround (Remastered Album Version)\n05.I'll Wait (2015 Remastered)\n06.Why Can't This Be Love (Remastered Version)\n07.Runnin' With The Devil (2015 Remastered)\n08.When It's Love (Remastered Album Version)\n09.Dancing In The Street (2015 Remastered)\n10.Not Enough (Remastered Album Version)\n11.Feels So Good (Remastered Single Version)\n12.Right Now (Remastered Album Version)\n13.Everybody Wants Some!!
