However, its early work could be considered \n\n&quot;darkwave&quot;. In their later work, including and subsequent to the \n\nrelease entitled The Serpent&amp;#039;s Egg, Dead Can Dance would take ancient \n\nor various musics from around the world as primary sources, with \n\nGerrard singing glossolalia, giving it a very distinctive style. As a \n\nresult, their later albums sound quite different from the first three. \n\nVarious sources have labelled those latter releases as neo-classical, \n\nethereal or dark world music.\n\n\nDiscography:\n\n1.
