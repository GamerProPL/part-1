Soulless Youth\n\nThe brash, northern swagger of English outfit Eagulls was encapsulated in their lo-fi, punk- inspired indie rock music. Based in Leeds, the five-piece was initially formed in 2010 by guitarist Mark Goldsworthy and drummer Henry Ruddel. The line-up was completed shortly thereafter with the addition of bassist Tom Kelly and second guitarist Liam Matthews; the final piece of the puzzle was the distinct vocals of George Mitchell. They began to move rapidly through the Leeds music scene, winning plaudits and fans with their unapologetic, chaotic brand of guitar-driven music, and in early 2011, they released their 7Ã¢â‚¬Â³ single, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Council Flat BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ through Not Even Records.\nEagulls will release their self-titled effort via Partisan Records on 3 March.\n\n\nPLEASE ENJOY AND SEED THANK YOU","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bff7f57133069bb38ccd72eb39b6185d6aa749b","amp;dn":"Eagulls-Eagulls+2014+320kbps+mp3+%28sizzler%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bff7f57133069bb38ccd72eb39b6185d6aa749b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,255,127,87,19,48,105,187,56,204,215,46,179,155,97,133,214,170,116,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
