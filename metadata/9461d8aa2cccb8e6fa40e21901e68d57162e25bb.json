Over tense eddies of fiddle and sympathetic acoustic strums, her dry husk of a voice sounds more resigned than outraged, as she realizes she's too late to save Delia. Several decades too late, as the case may be: The Delia sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singing about is the title character in the popular murder ballad &quot;Delia's Gone&quot;, written by Dick Toops and Karl Silbersdorf and recorded by Bob Dylan, Harry Belafonte, Waylon Jennings, and multiple times by Johnny Cash. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Body ElectricÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ seeks to rescue Delia and so many other murder-ballad victims, offering an empatheticÃ¢â‚¬â€and feministÃ¢â‚¬â€reading of an American folk tradition that lives on today in contemporary covers of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Banks of the OhioÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Knoxville Girl&quot;. Murder ballads allow us to act out dark urges, using history to guard us against accusations of sociopathy or misogyny. But Segarra laments our fascination with such abject subject matter: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shoot me down, put my body in the river,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she sings, Ã¢â‚¬Å“while the whole world sings, sings it like a song/ The whole world sings like thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing going wrong.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nFor Segarra, a Bronx-born Puerto Rican who gravitated toward Bikini Kill before discovering Woody Guthrie, the past is not a thing to be revered. Rather, it must be endlessly, aggressively interrogated. Small Town Heroes borrows liberally from old-time traditions, including Appalachian reels, Big Easy R&amp;B, and Piedmont blues, yet these songs put a fresh and wily spin on old sounds and ideas. Segarra rewrites Jesse FullerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“San Francisco Bay BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, retitling it Ã¢â‚¬Å“The New SF Bay BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and changing the subject from a wronged woman to a brokedown touring van: Ã¢â‚¬Å“YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been a good old wagon/ You got me there in styleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). Ã¢â‚¬Å“Crash on the HighwayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ subtly rewrites Roy AcuffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wreck on the HighwayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, its two-step beat evoking the boredom and frustration of backed-up traffic. These are songs about touring as rambling; instead of hitchinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ rides and jumpinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ trains, Segarra and Hurray for the Riff Raff are gigging around the country in a cramped van.\nSmall Town Heroes may not sound like what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d expect from a New Orleans album, yet it is anchored in that cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sense of musical adventure. Segarra learned her trade playing in street bands and busking on corners, which has given her a broad musical vocabulary. She arranges and produces these songs as eloquently as she writes them, often using just a few instruments to convey a surprisingly full sound. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blue Ridge MountainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ opens the album with her clawhammer banjo and what sounds like a clogger working together as a makeshift rhythm section, with Yosi PerlsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spry fiddle dancing around them. Ã¢â‚¬Å“No One ElseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is built on a folk-rock foundation, yet it pitches and yaws on a rolling piano bassline that might have been learned from an old Fats Domino or Professor Longhair record.\nWith Small Town Heroes, Segarra proves herself one of the most compelling stylists in a folk revival full of suspicious acts either too beholden to tradition or too uncritical to make much of it. Perhaps the biggest difference between Hurray and its peers is attitude: Segarra understands that these styles donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to be revived, so sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not playing dress-up and isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t concerned with projecting any sense of rustic authenticity. Instead, she understands that these old sounds still thrum somewhere deep in the American subconscious, even if our relation to them changes with each passing year. With the whole country as its geographical and historical backdrop, Small Town Heroes is an album about how life and music intersect. Rather than play to her record collection, however, Segarra takes the records out of their sleeves, scratches them up, and makes the old music speak to new concerns.\nReview By Stephen M.
