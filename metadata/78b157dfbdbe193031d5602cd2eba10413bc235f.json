I muxed that because all the subtitles I've found where a bit wrong. Once I improved them I decided to piece everything together to better share it with my friends. Then I realized that better to share with the whole community. So here it goes.\n\nTo better enjoy the subtitles (mostly in the last song in Chapter I and the first one in Chapter II) use a media player that take advantage of the ssa stylized subtitles. (i.e. 'media player classic' keeps the text in the designed position, VLC doesn't).\n\nIf anyone would like to do a karaoke version just contact me and I'll gladly send them the subtitles\n\nThank to the creators of the stuff I worked from.\n\nEnjoy it and spread the joy of sharing.\n\npeace.... but not literally XDDDD\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78b157dfbdbe193031d5602cd2eba10413bc235f","amp;dn":"Dr.+Horrible%5C%27s+Sing-Along+Blog-720p%28subs+Eng-Spa%29%5Bby+Kirune%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78b157dfbdbe193031d5602cd2eba10413bc235f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,177,87,223,189,190,25,48,49,213,96,44,210,235,161,4,19,188,35,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
