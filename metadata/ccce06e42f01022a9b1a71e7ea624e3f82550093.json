Please seed.\n\n\nThe Terminator series is a science fiction franchise encompassing a series of films and other media concerning battles between Skynet\\'s artificially intelligent machine network, and John Connor\\'s Resistance forces and the rest of the human race.\n\nSkynet\\'s most well-known products in its genocidal goals are the various terminator models, such as the original \\&quot;Terminator\\&quot; character, portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the first film. Schwarzenegger also portrayed other Terminator characters; however, it is made clear that these are different models. The latest film in the franchise is Terminator Salvation, released over Memorial Day weekend, 2009.\n\nTerminator 1: The Terminator\n\nThe Terminator is a 1984 science fiction film released by Orion Pictures, co-written and directed by James Cameron and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Michael Biehn. It is the first work in the Terminator franchise. In the film, machines take over the world in the near future, directed by the artificial intelligence Skynet. With its sole mission to completely annihilate humanity, it develops cyborg assassins called Terminators that outwardly appear human. A man named John Connor starts the Tech-Com resistance to defeat them and free humanity. With a human victory imminent, the machines\\' only choice is to send a Terminator back in time to kill John\\'s mother, Sarah Connor, before he is born, preventing the resistance from ever being founded. With the fate of humanity at stake, John sends soldier Kyle Reese back to protect his mother and ensure his own existence.\n\n\nTerminator 2: Judgement Day\n\nTerminator 2: Judgement Day is the 1991 sequel to the original Terminator film released by TriStar Pictures. It is co-written, directed, and produced by James Cameron and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, and Robert Patrick. After the machines failed to prevent John Connor from being born, they try again in 1995, this time attempting to kill him as a child with a more advanced terminator, the T-1000. As before, John sends back a protector for his younger self, a reprogrammed Terminator, identical to the one from the previous film. After eleven years of preparing for the future war, Sarah decides to use the same tactics the machines used on her: prevent Skynet from being invented by destroying Cyberdyne Systems before they create it.\n\n\nTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines\n\nTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines is the 2003 sequel to Terminator 2 released by Warner Bros., directed by Jonathan Mostow and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes, and Kristanna Loken. As a result of the destruction of Cyberdyne at the end of T2, the Skynet takeover has been postponed, not averted. In a last attempt to ensure a victory by the machines, a new terminator, the T-X, is sent back to kill as many of John Connor\\'s future lieutenants as possible, including John Connor and his future wife Kate. After the future Connor is terminated by a version of his previous protector, Kate reprograms it and sends it back to save them both from the T-X.\n\n\nTerminator 4: Salvation\n\nTerminator Salvation is the fourth installment of the Terminator film series, released by Warner Bros. on May 21, 2009. It was written by John D. Brancato, Michael Ferris, Jonathan Nolan, and Anthony E. Zuiker, directed by McG, and stars Christian Bale as John Connor. After Skynet has destroyed much of humanity in a nuclear holocaust, John struggles to become the leader, but in this future, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington, who was personally recommended by James Cameron) has somehow altered it, and the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger and Roland Kickinger) is coming online sooner than expected. The film also centers on Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and how he became the man he was in the first film.\n\n\nEnjoy,\n\nTSV","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccce06e42f01022a9b1a71e7ea624e3f82550093","amp;dn":"The+Terminator+DVD+Boxset+Part+1%2C+2%2C+3+%26+4+-+The+Complete+Quadri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccce06e42f01022a9b1a71e7ea624e3f82550093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,206,6,228,47,1,2,42,155,26,113,231,234,98,78,63,130,85,0,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
