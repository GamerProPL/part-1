(using the program &quot;Handbreak&quot;)\nSurprisingly, the quality is almost the same. Saving disk space, I reccomend my version. \n\n* Subtitles: \nSwitch subtitles in your mediaplayer.\nThe Farsi-subs may be faulty. I can't check them. The PC's here do not display any Farsi.\nSubs were hard to find. I found Arab subs, but very incomplete.\nThe MKV-file has English subtitles built-in. (Not burned in)\nNorge and Farsi (and another English) are SRT-subtitle files. The MKV will work without them.\n\n* Language:\nThe original ARTE-French (TV) documentary had French language dubbed in, leaving the spoken Hebrew in the background. \nIn this version, all spoken words are in Hebrew, and all text (very little) is in English.\n\n\n* Personal note: \n\nWhile watching, keep realising the whole context, these men were part of. If not, you might think, they acted 'reasonable' or in self-defence. Remember what started the problem, and what keeps it going on:\n\nEuropean Jews developed a Zionist plan for a Jewish state on Palestinian land. After mass immigration with help of the English army (and a lot of European violence), they expelled 750.000 Palestinians from their land in 1948, and created the state of Israel. \nThen 19 years later in 1967, they occupied the rest of the Palestinian land (again expelling many), claiming that too. The occupational practices have been horrible for over 46 years now. \n\nThere is no chicken-or-egg-question here. Everything starts with (Jewish-Zionist) Israeli violence. Palestinians respond,and can truly call upon self-defence in most cases. Israel cannot, because their violence almost never is an excusable Ã¢â‚¬Å“Last Resort OptionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. \nThe difference between Terrorists and Freedom Fighters is not relative. Invading is very violent (terrorist), and the occupied nation is the victim, having a right of violent self-defence (Freedom fight), if nothing else works.\n\nSo Shin Bet is and was an instrument of a very violent invasion. And recruting collaboraters during all this, creates a tremendous distrust among the defenceless civillians of the occupied nation. It's a very dirty tool of oppression, and must be considered a true criminal act.\n\nThe most famous Middle-East journalist Robert Fisk simply called the case Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Last Colonial WarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and that is exactly what it is. The US and the EU make Israel strong enough to continue all this, and permanently refuse any Ã¢â‚¬Å“serious consequencesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to Israeli violence, including the many violations of international law.\n\nAlmost all 'Arab terrorists' had the case on top of their complaints list, making it the most plausible cause for 9/11. But even that was silenced, like all the rest of the violent western role in the case. The western Terror-industry (resembling Finkelsteins &quot;Holocaust-industry&quot;) florishes, promoted by the same type of myths as in Israel's calls upon self-defence.\n\n\n* 5 Files: \nInfo.txt\nThe.Gatekeepers.2012.Hebrew.Subs-Eng.655MB.Shin.Bet.MKV (655 MB)\nThe.Gatekeepers.2012.Hebrew.Subs-Eng.655MB.Shin.Bet-Eng.srt\nThe.Gatekeepers.2012.Hebrew.Subs-Eng.655MB.Shin.Bet-Farsi.srt\nThe.Gatekeepers.2012.Hebrew.Subs-Eng.655MB.Shin.Bet-Norge.srt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f58bc0c37f59d9a8e5a746f31e0b8167d7c5ab6c","amp;dn":"The.Gatekeepers.2012.Hebrew.Subs-Eng.655MB.Shin.Bet.MKV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f58bc0c37f59d9a8e5a746f31e0b8167d7c5ab6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,139,192,195,127,89,217,168,229,167,70,243,30,11,129,103,215,197,171,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
