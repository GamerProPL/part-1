She is a young Seattle college dropout who is unhappy with life. She is always at odds with her mom, Joy. One day coming back from her temp job as a filing clerk, she is hit by the toilet seat of the re-entering Space Station Mir. Finding out she is now dead, she is recruited to become a grim reaper. As in life, she is a pain in the butt in death. She does not like the details of her job, and is always at loggerheads with her boss Rube. Her fellow grim reapers don't really take much of a liking to her either. She also learns grim reapers don't even get a free ride in death, as they must hold down regular jobs along with their death duties.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348913/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348913/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83fed9b4db9ca6de9aecf2b555aa0db35fde8ec5","amp;dn":"Dead+Like+Me+DVDrip+Season+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83fed9b4db9ca6de9aecf2b555aa0db35fde8ec5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,254,217,180,219,156,166,222,154,236,242,181,85,170,13,179,95,222,142,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
