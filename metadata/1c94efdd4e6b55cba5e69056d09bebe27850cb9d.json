Powerful illustration tools, innovative photo editing, flexible page layout and unrivalled WYSIWYG web design. A single application for all your creative work.\n\nFeatures :\n\nNew Shadow and Highlight Controls\nTwo great new options within the Photo Tool that give you precise control over specific areas of your photo that are in deep shadow or bright light. Simply use the sliders on the InfoBar to lighten/ darken those areas, without affecting the brightness levels of the rest of the photo.\n\nSelect &amp; Enhance Colors\nA new Color Select option within the Enhance Photo Tool provides a fast and intuitive way to perform any enhance operation - such as a change of brightness, contrast or color - based on a selected color in your image.\n\nPhotoLooks Plug-in\nPhotoLooks 2 is a powerful and flexible plug-in (previously sold by Red Giant for $199) that will be bundled with all copies of Designer Pro X10 - and it could change the way you approach color in photography!\n\nPanorama Tool Improvements\nThere have been several workflow improvements to the integrated photo panorama too, for example it's no longer necessary to arrange images left to right prior to stitching. There is also improved image alignment and lens distortion correction.\n\nAuto-Rotate of Photos on Import\nYou might have recently noticed that that your photos were being randomly rotated when you imported them from some modern devices. Where necessary Designer Pro X10 now does an auto detect and rotate to fix this issue.\n\n32 bit plug-in support\nThe 64 bit version of Designer Pro now supports 32 bit Photoshop and other Live Effect plug-ins.\n\nResponsive Web Design\nWith the surge in popularity of browsing on mobiles and tablets it is becoming essential to create sites that are tailored to the needs of these visitors. Until now the solution has involved creating multiple sites and a good understanding of ja;vascript. Designer Pro X10 introduces a RWD solution that allows you to create a single file containing variants of your site at different widths, so that you website responds dynamically to the screen size of the viewer, presenting the design most appropriate to their device. And as youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d expect from Designer Pro you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to do any coding whatsoever!\n\nCreating Online Presentations\nThe new page transitions are a great enhancement for presentations, but there are also a few other minor useability enhancements in the process of creating and viewing steps, plus two new aspect ratio Ã¢â‚¬ËœemptyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ templates (16x10 widescreen and 4:3 traditional screen).\n\nScale To Fit\nInstead of designing presentation websites for specific screen sizes, the pages will now intelligently and automatically scale to fit any browser size (or you can set them to full-screen). Nb you can use this for websites too, it could be a good option if, like presentations, they are relatively small sites with short pages (might be good with a Supersite for example, so each page would automatically resize to fit the browser window).\n\nSingle Page Supersites\nIf you have a small or very focused site and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re struggling to make it stand out from the crowd, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to love our new concept of souped-up single page sites!\n\nNew Page Transitions\nV10 offers significantly improved page transition effects including 3D effects, which are hardware accelerated, super-smooth and completely flicker free. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re ideal for presentations, but can also be used with great effect for Supersites.\n\nPassword Protected MAGIX Online World Pages\nIf you publish your website via MAGIX Online World (free MOW hosting is included in all copies of Designer Pro), you can now easily password protect that website. Includes full facilities for managing your authorization list.\n\nFont Awesome Symbols\nA quick &amp; easy way to insert symbols from the large and growing Font Awesome selection. The full set is displayed via the Insert menu, simply browse and click on the symbol you require to insert it in your document as a text character or graphic.\n\nSmartShapes\nAn amazingly quick and easy way to create and edit some of the most commonly required shapes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for example speech bubbles, fancy arrows and text panels - with top quality results guaranteed. If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the time (or skill) to master the drawing tools youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll no longer need to resort to clipart. Here are some examples from the Smart Shapes library (internet delivered, so more shapes will be added thru the rest of this year) that can be easily customized.\n\nInsert Menu\nA new top level Insert menu which considerably improves the ease with which you can insert key elements into your document (eg insert new page or insert page number) including some new options eg Ã¢â‚¬Ëœinsert image from CameraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, SmartShapes and Font Awesome symbols.\n\nMicrosoft Word Import .doc added, .docx improved\n.docx import has been significantly improved and support for .doc files has been added for the first time.\n\nImproved PDF Import\nThe PDF import filter has been replaced with a completely new one which is already showing significantly improved editability.\n\nImproved RTF Import &amp; Export\nThere is improved support for text styles, lists, anchored and embedded bitmaps, strikethrough text and pagination.\n\nWhat's new :\n\nWhat's new\n\nNotes :\n\n1.
