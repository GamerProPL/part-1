I decided on the older &quot;All Time Greatest Hits&quot; compilation because it is the most comprehensive, including all of Barry White's 70s R &amp; B hits and in chronological order rather than in the haphazard hit and miss way such collections are often presented. As the grandfather of heavily syncopated smooth disco soul of the 70s, Barry is without peer. Barring the opening Love Unlimited instrumental which has sadly lost its appeal through commercial overuse and consequently degenerated into muzak or jingle, the first half of the compilation confirms that for the kind of music he was making, Barry was peerless and could do no wrong when he was tearing up the charts. &quot;I'm Gonna Love You Just A Little More, Baby&quot;, &quot;I've Got So Much To Give&quot;, &quot;Never, Never Gonna Give You Up&quot;, &quot;Can't Get Enough Of Your Love, Babe&quot; and &quot;You're The First, My Last, My Everything&quot; still sound as fresh and terrific today as they did more than 25 years ago. But by the time we get to &quot;I'm Qualified To Satisfy You&quot;, the listening experience becomes interminable because the songs begin to sound the same, except that they're of far less distinguished quality. Even &quot;It's Ecstasy When You Lay Down Next To Me&quot; which was something of a latter day chart stormer for Barry fails to impress. The slower &quot;Playing Your Game, Baby&quot; breaks the monotony momentarily to provide some relief but the CD's best moments have long passed. Covering Billy Joel's &quot;Just The Way You Are&quot; isn't a good idea. This is a classic case of less being more and the law of diminishing returns setting in once past the optimum point. While Barry White fans will no doubt disagree - and I symphathise - the casual listener may be better served by a more concise greatest hits package concentrating on his early smash hits. But you can't please everyone. &quot;All Time Greatest Hits&quot; is still a wonderful anthology of Barry's hit making years and great value for money.
