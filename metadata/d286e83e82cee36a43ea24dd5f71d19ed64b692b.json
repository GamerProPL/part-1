The intention is to preserve gaming history by preventing vintage games from being lost or forgotten. The aim of MAME is to be a reference to the inner workings of the emulated arcade machines; the ability to actually play the games is considered &quot;a nice side effect&quot;.[2]\n\nThe first public MAME release (0.1) was on February 5, 1997, by Nicola Salmoria. The emulator now supports over seven thousand unique games and ten thousand actual ROM image sets, though not all of the supported games are playable. The project is currently maintained by MESS project leader, Miodrag Milanovic.[3]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d286e83e82cee36a43ea24dd5f71d19ed64b692b","amp;dn":"MAME32+v0+106+Arcade+Starter+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d286e83e82cee36a43ea24dd5f71d19ed64b692b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,134,232,62,130,206,227,106,67,234,36,221,95,113,209,158,214,75,105,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
