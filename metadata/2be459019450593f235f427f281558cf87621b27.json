Vincent Malek, a cruel and uncompromising killer forces Ben to play his deadly game. Relentlessly hunted through unforgiving terrain, Ben must draw on all his strength to survive, and unravel the truth along the way. The ultimate psychological chase film with revenge at its core, The Backpacker is a thriller in the same chilling vein as the late 60's box office sensation 'Deliverance'. As Malek hunts Ben relentlessly through his forest hunting ground in a gruesome game of cat and mouse, the action revolves around one crucial question: how far would you go for revenge... \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2be459019450593f235f427f281558cf87621b27","amp;dn":"The+Backpacker+%282011%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2be459019450593f235f427f281558cf87621b27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,228,89,1,148,80,89,63,35,95,66,127,40,21,88,207,135,98,27,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
