Carly is the lucky woman to get the first one-on-one date, but the couple has to survive a very awkward, intimate meeting with the &quot;Love Guru.&quot; Kelsey, already the focus of the other women's animosity, stirs up more trouble when some of the women don't believe her to be the sympathetic character she seems to be. A group date with nine gorgeous bachelorettes challenges them to ride the whitewater rapids of the Rio Grande River, but one woman falls overboard with perilous results. A stunned Chris is confronted by a rejected lady from his past who won't take &quot;no&quot; for an answer. The Bachelor swoops in and takes Britt on a fabulously romantic hot air balloon ride, but is there something she is hiding from Chris to curry favor? Finally, Kelsey's bid for attention goes awry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f80a3d64d698cb9c4c4b088c92549fad99c8a860","amp;dn":"The.Bachelor.S19E05.WEB-DL.x264-Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f80a3d64d698cb9c4c4b088c92549fad99c8a860","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,10,61,100,214,152,203,156,76,75,8,140,146,84,159,173,153,200,168,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
