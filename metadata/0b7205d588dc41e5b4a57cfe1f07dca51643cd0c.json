It was recorded between January and August 1970 and released on 5 October by Atlantic Records. Composed largely at a remote cottage in Wales known as Bron-Yr-Aur, this work represented a maturing of the band's music towards a greater emphasis on folk and acoustic sounds. This surprised many fans and critics, and upon its release the album received rather indifferent reviews.\n\nAlthough it is not one of the highest sellers in Zeppelin's catalogue, Led Zeppelin III is now generally praised, and acknowledged as representing an important milestone in their history. Although acoustic songs are featured on its predecessors, it is this album which is widely acknowledged for showing that Led Zeppelin were more than just a conventional rock band and that they could branch out into wider musical territory.\n\n2014 reissue\n\nAlong with the group's self-titled debut album and their second album, Led Zeppelin II, Led Zeppelin III was remastered and reissued in June 2014. The reissue comes in 6 formats: a standard CD edition, a deluxe 2 CD edition, a standard LP version, a deluxe 2 LP version, a super deluxe 2 CD + 2 LP version with a hardback book, and as high resolution 96k/24-bit digital downloads. The deluxe and super deluxe editions feature bonus material containing alternative takes, backing tracks and previously unreleased songs, &quot;Bathroom Sound&quot;, &quot;Jennings Farm Blues&quot;, &quot;Key to the Highway/Trouble in Mind&quot; The LP versions replicate the original Vovelle sleeve design.\n\n\nTrack Listing - 2014 Remaster [320k MP3]\n\n\n01. \t&quot;Immigrant Song&quot;   \tJimmy Page, Robert Plant \t2:26\n02. \t&quot;Friends&quot;   \tPage, Plant \t3:55\n03. \t&quot;Celebration Day&quot;   \tJohn Paul Jones, Page, Plant \t3:29\n04. \t&quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot;   \tJones, Page, Plant \t7:25\n05. \t&quot;Out on the Tiles&quot;   \tJohn Bonham, Page, Plant \t4:04\n06. \t&quot;Gallows Pole&quot;   \tTraditional, arr.
