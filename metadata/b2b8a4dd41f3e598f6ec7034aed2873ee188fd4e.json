He recorded a number of hits such as &quot;Lean on Me&quot;, &quot;Ain't No Sunshine&quot;, &quot;Use Me&quot;, &quot;Just the Two of Us&quot;, &quot;Lovely Day&quot;, and &quot;Grandma's Hands&quot;. His life was the subject of the 2009 documentary film Still Bill.\n\nI can not say enough good things about this man. I am more of a recent listener to Bill Withers music. I have heard it for some years on movie tracks, commercials, hearing other artists cover his songs, but I never actually equated him with the songs I was hearing. I managed to get a hold of just about every album he has created and am loving it. His style to me has a sort of Country and Western style to it MINUS the country TWANG...I think it is something to do with his delivery and the theme of his songs. \n\nI hope you Bill Withers fans love it as well. As usual seed as long as possible and more importantly enjoy\n\nAlbums Include:\n\n1971 Bill Withers - Just As I AM\n1972 Bill Withers - Still Bill\n1973 Bill Withers - Live At Carnegie Hall\n1974 Bill Withers - +Justments\n1975 Bill Withers - Making Music, Making Friends\n1976 Bill Withers - Naked And Warm\n1977 Bill Withers - Menagerie\n1978 Bill Withers - Bout Love\n1985 Bill Withers - Watching You , Watching Me","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2b8a4dd41f3e598f6ec7034aed2873ee188fd4e","amp;dn":"BILL+WITHERS+DISCOGRAPHY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2b8a4dd41f3e598f6ec7034aed2873ee188fd4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,184,164,221,65,243,229,152,246,236,112,52,174,210,135,62,225,136,253,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
