The band is young again. We've got a new sense of purpose and we believe in what we're doing. We just fell back in love with the idea of what we get to do.&quot;\n\nRivers In The Wasteland - the sound of a band excited to reconnect with the idea of a fresh start, and featuring &quot;Difference Maker,&quot; &quot;Multiplied,&quot; &quot;The Heart,&quot; and &quot;Brother&quot; - was co-produced by the band with the help of various producers including Joe Chiccarelli, Kevin Augunas, Ed Cash and Jerrod Bettis, and was recorded at the band's own Plantation Studios in Charleston, Fairfax Recordings (formally Sound City Studios) in Los Angeles and Blackbird Studios in Nashville.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd503b37f7f3a8bae51d89c74914acb5652b7b0c","amp;dn":"Needtobreathe+-+Rivers+In+the+Wasteland+%282014%29+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd503b37f7f3a8bae51d89c74914acb5652b7b0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,80,59,55,247,243,168,186,229,29,137,199,73,20,172,181,101,43,123,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
