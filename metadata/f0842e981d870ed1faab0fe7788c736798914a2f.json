The versions on iTunes, Amazon and Play Store are all limited to US customers..? The reason for this is not really clear. Still, if you want to support the creators, do consider buying the movie or subscribe to their blog:\r\n \nhttp://minimalismfilm.com\r\n\r\nHow might your life be better with less? MINIMALISM: A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE IMPORTANT THINGS examines the many flavors of minimalism by taking the audience inside the lives of minimalists from all walks of lifeâ€”families, entrepreneurs, architects, artists, journalists, scientists, and even a former Wall Street brokerâ€”all of whom are striving to live a meaningful life with less.\r\n\r\nScreencaps: http://imgur.com/a/MT0jn\r\nNote: The video is a bit shaky in some places.
