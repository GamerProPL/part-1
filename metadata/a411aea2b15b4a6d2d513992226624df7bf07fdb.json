I was drawn to him as IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never been to anything or anyone in my life. I craved his touch like a drug, even knowing it would weaken me. I was flawed and damaged, and he opened those cracks in me so easilyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nGideon knew. He had demons of his own.

As beautiful and flawless on the outside as he was damaged and tormented on the inside. He was a bright, scorching flame that singed me with the darkest of pleasures. I couldn't stay away. I didn't want to. He was my addiction... my every desire... mine.\n\nMy past was as violent as his, and I was just as broken. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never work. It was too hard, too painful... except when it was perfect. Those moments when the driving hunger and desperate love were the most exquisite insanity. \n\nWe were bound by our need. And our passion would take us beyond our limits to the sweetest, sharpest edge of obsession... \n\nEntwined with You (Crossfire #3) by Sylvia Day (June 4th 2013)\n\nThe worldwide phenomenon continues as Eva and Gideon face the demons of their pasts, and accept the consequences of their obsessive desiresÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nFrom the moment I first met Gideon Cross, I recognized something in him that I needed. Something I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resist. I saw the dangerous and damaged soul insideÃ¢â‚¬â€œso much like my own. I was drawn to it. I needed him as surely as I needed my heart to beat.\n\nNo one knows how much he risked for me. How much IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been threatened, or just how dark and desperate the shadow of our pasts would become.\n\nEntwined by our secrets, we tried to defy the odds. We made our own rules and surrendered completely to the exquisite power of possessionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a411aea2b15b4a6d2d513992226624df7bf07fdb","amp;dn":"Crossfire+Series+%281-3%29+by+Sylvia+Day+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a411aea2b15b4a6d2d513992226624df7bf07fdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,17,174,162,177,91,74,109,45,81,57,146,34,102,36,223,123,240,127,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
