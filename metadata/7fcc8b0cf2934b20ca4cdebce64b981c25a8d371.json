Bolan's seminal rocker remastered with B-sides, demos and outtakes...\n\nElectric Warrior Ã¢â‚¬â€œ released in September 1971 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is the fundament of glam rock. Falling between T.Rex and The Slider, and released in September 1971, its achievement is remarkable given that it came almost a full year before the release of Roxy Music and The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy StardustÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. \n\nT.Rex at this moment still offered the rarefied version of what the next wave (Mud, Sweet, Glitter, Slade) would soon convert into hod-carriersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ high camp Ã¢â‚¬â€œ rock Ã¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll for rouged roofers. The secret lay in the time-travelling eclecticism of all three; Bolan had been laundered through the washing machine of successive 60s subcultures, from Mod to psychedelic folk, but already in Tyrannosaurus Rex the nostalgic troubadour impulse had been lavishly embellished with orientalist, rococo degree of pantomime that bordered on kitsch Ã¢â‚¬â€œ onyx statuettes glimpsed through aspidistra leaves.\n\nBolanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very public friendship with John Peel ensured plenty of radio exposure in the previous years, but he began to cut the DJ dead around now, jumping from the sinking Perfumed Garden/Middle Earth ship and restyling himself as a galactic rock star retooled for the 1970s. Even the ambience of Tony ViscontiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s production is very different from the Joe Boyd/John Wood-style sound of folk-rock: Bill LegendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drums swathed in a claustrophobic flutter-echo; Mickey FinnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stipplings of congas and bongos; supermarket string arrangements; thong-tight humbucker fuzz from BolanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guitars; and his breathy vocal close up to the mic and shorn of its woolliest Tyrannosaurus Rex tics. No longer the clatter of a band in a room, the soundworld of Electric Warrior is an artificial acoustic palace of mirrors, curling smoke and follow-spots.\n\nEXTRAS: This edition includes the more sedate hit Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hot LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, plus B sides Ã¢â‚¬Å“There Was A Time/Raw RampÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“King Of The Mountain ComethÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Woodland RockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a smooth fusion of Chuck Berry and backwards-guitar psych. \nThe bonus audio disc is a real treat, containing unheard alternative versions and startlingly intimate home demos recorded by a lone Bolan.\n\n\n\nT.REX\n\nElectric Warrior 1971\n40th Anniversary Deluxe Edition\n\n\nD1 The Original Album, Singles A and B Sides\nD2 Demos and Outtakes, previously unreleased\n\n\n2 CDs\n2012\n\nMp3\n320Kbps\nSize: 268 MB\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nElectric Warrior Disc 1\n\n01 Mambo Sun.mp3 8 MB\n02 Cosmic Dancer.mp3 10 MB\n03 Jeepster.mp3 10 MB\n04 Monolith.mp3 9 MB\n05 Lean Woman Blues.mp3 7 MB\n06 Get It On.mp3 10 MB\n07 Planet Queen.mp3 7 MB\n08 Girl.mp3 6 MB\n09 The Motivator.mp3 9 MB\n10 Life's a Gas.mp3 5 MB\n11 Rip Off.mp3 9 MB\n12 There Was a Time-Raw Ramp [-][B-Side].mp3 12 MB\n13 Hot Love [-][A-Side].mp3 11 MB\n14 Woodland Rock [-][B-Side].mp3 6 MB\n15 The King of the Mountain Cometh [-][B-Side].mp3 9 MB\n\nElectric Warrior  Disc 2\n\n01 Electric Warrior Poem [Edit][US Radio Promo].mp3 1 MB\n02 Mambo Sun [Edit][Instrumental Edit].mp3 9 MB\n03 Cosmic Dancer [Mix][Vocal Mix].mp3 10 MB\n04 Jeepster [Mix][Vocal Mix].mp3 10 MB\n05 Monolith [Version][Working Version].mp3 6 MB\n06 Lean Woman Blues [Version][Working Version].mp3 7 MB\n07 Get It On [Full Length Version][Version].mp3 13 MB\n08 Planet Queen [Version][Working Version].mp3 7 MB\n09 Girl [Alternate Take][Alternative Master].mp3 6 MB\n10 The Motivator [Version][Working Version].mp3 9 MB\n11 Life's a Gas [Version][Working Version].mp3 8 MB\n12 Rip Off [Instrumental][Instrumental].mp3 8 MB\n13 Raw Ramp [Version][Working Version].mp3 5 MB\n14 Electric Boogie [Version][Working Version].mp3 5 MB\n15 Untitled (A.k.a.
