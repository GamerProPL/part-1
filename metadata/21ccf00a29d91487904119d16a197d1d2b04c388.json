When her rescue came, she grabbed a blaster and joined the fight, escaping back to the Rebel Alliance and helping strike the biggest blow against the Empire-the destruction of the Death Star. But in the aftermath of that victory, the question remains...what is a princess without a world? Writer Mark Waid (Daredevil, S.H.I.E.L.D.) and artist Terry Dodson (Avengers &amp; X-Men: Axis, Uncanny X-Men) bring us a story of Leia's quest to help her people and find her place in the galaxy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21ccf00a29d91487904119d16a197d1d2b04c388","amp;dn":"Princess+Leia+01+%28of+05%29+%282015%29+%28Digital%29+%28BlackManta-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21ccf00a29d91487904119d16a197d1d2b04c388","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,204,240,10,41,217,20,135,144,65,25,209,106,25,125,29,43,4,195,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
