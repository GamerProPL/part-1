He told his congregation he needed to lose weight and asked if anyone wanted to join him. He thought maybe 200 people would sign up, instead he witnessed a movement unfold as 15,000 people lost over 260,000 pounds in the first year. With assistance from medical and fitness experts, Pastor Rick and thousands of people began a journey to transform their lives. Welcome to The Daniel Plan. Here's the secret sauce: The Daniel Plan is designed to be done in a supportive community relying on God's instruction for living. When it comes to getting healthy, two are always better than one. Our research has revealed that people getting healthy together lose twice as much weight as those who do it alone. God never meant for you to go through life alone and that includes the journey to health. Unlike the thousands of other books on the market, this book is not about a new diet, guilt-driven gym sessions, or shame-driven fasts. The Daniel Plan shows you how the powerful combination of faith, fitness, food, focus, and friends will change your health forever, transforming you in the most head-turning way imaginablyÃ¢â‚¬â€from the inside out.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b571efe079af9472c33377fa6e48b611c8bdd97c","amp;dn":"The+Daniel+Plan%3A+40+Days+to+a+Healthier+Life+-+Daniel+Amen+%2C+Ric","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b571efe079af9472c33377fa6e48b611c8bdd97c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,113,239,224,121,175,148,114,195,51,119,250,110,72,182,17,200,189,217,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
