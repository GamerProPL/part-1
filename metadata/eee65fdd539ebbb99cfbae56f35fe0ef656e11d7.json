We saw it one late night not really knowing what to expect but this was over our expectations. Funny and well written dialouge, great acting and an amazing story! I laughed, almost cried, was chocked, laughed again and got some new tools to handle life with =) It is what I would call a black comedy in the same way as Blinkande Lyktor or Old men in new cars, both of them great danish movies. What caught me was the wicked story and how they really make it seem possible. I can imagine that this has taken place in a small church somewhere on the danish countryside. The dialouge is great, tons of punchlines that bubbles up the day after or even weeks after you have seen the film.\n\nEnglish subs:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/nl/subtitles/126034/adams-abler-en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/nl/subtitles/126034/adams-abler-en&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eee65fdd539ebbb99cfbae56f35fe0ef656e11d7","amp;dn":"Adam%5C%27s+Apples+%5B2005%5D+%5BDVDRip%5D+%5BXvid%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eee65fdd539ebbb99cfbae56f35fe0ef656e11d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,230,95,221,83,158,187,185,156,251,174,86,243,95,224,239,101,110,17,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
