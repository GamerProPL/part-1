His clever and imaginative spatial creations are remarkable in economic as well as ecological and sociological terms. The focus of his designs is always on the needs of the future users. This monograph analyzes the principal aspects of his work in seminal essays by renowned architecture critics and uses text and images to document all the important buildings of his thirty-year career. Editor Mikael Nanfeldt is curator of the RÃ¶hss Museum of Design and Applied Arts in GÃ¶teborg, the opening venue for a large exhibition of WingÃ¥rdhs work that then moves on to the Swedish Museum of Architecture in Stockholm before going on to tour internationally. WingÃ¥rdhs most remarkable projects include prizewinning laboratory buildings in Sweden and the United States, the Swedish embassies in Berlin and Washington, numerous villas, and the MÃ¼ritzeum, a recently opened visitor center in Waren, Germany","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57a85e034b854231baed12258fa0d2e56da793ab","amp;dn":"Gert+Wingardh+-+Thirty+Years+of+Architecture+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57a85e034b854231baed12258fa0d2e56da793ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,168,94,3,75,133,66,49,186,237,18,37,143,160,210,229,109,167,147,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
