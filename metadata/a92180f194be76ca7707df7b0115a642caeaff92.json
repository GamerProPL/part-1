Resh, Ph.D.(born January 11, 1941 in Canada) is a recognized authority worldwide on hydroponics. His website www.howardresh.com presents information on hydroponic culture of various vegetable crops. In addition, he has written five books on hydroponic culture both for commercial growers and backyard hobbyists. The call of commercial hydroponics has taken him to many projects in countries including Venezuela, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, the United States, and in 1999 to Anguilla, British West Indies, in the Eastern Caribbean, where he is still today. Resh continues to do consulting on many unique hydroponic greenhouse operations, including Lufa Farms in Montreal, Canada, where he established the growing techniques and hydroponic systems for a rooftop hydroponic greenhouse in downtown Montreal.\n\nCONTENTS\nChapter 1 Introduction ...................................................................................................1\nChapter 2 Plant Nutrition .................................................................................................9\nChapter 3 Nutrient Solution ...........................................................................................31\nChapter 4 The Medium ..................................................................................................89\nChapter 5 Water Culture ................................................................................................97\nChapter 6 Nutrient Film Technique .............................................................................145\nChapter 7 Gravel Culture .............................................................................................199\nChapter 8 Sand Culture ................................................................................................ 217\nChapter 9 Sawdust Culture ...........................................................................................231\nChapter 10 Rockwool Culture ........................................................................................245\nChapter 11 Coco Coir Culture .......................................................................................293\nChapter 12 Other Soilless Cultures ................................................................................309\nChapter 13 Tropical Hydroponics and Special Applications .........................................349\nChapter 14 Plant Culture................................................................................................387\nAppendix 1: Horticultural, Hydroponic, and Soilless-Culture Societies ..................475\nAppendix 2: Greenhouse Production Resources .........................................................477\nAppendix 3: Units of MeasurementÃ¢â‚¬â€Conversion Factors ........................................ 483\nAppendix 4: Physical Constants of Inorganic Compounds ....................................... 485\nAppendix 5: Greenhouse and Hydroponic Suppliers ................................................. 487\nBibliography ..........................................................................................................493\nIndex ....................................................................................................................513","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a92180f194be76ca7707df7b0115a642caeaff92","amp;dn":"Hydroponic+Food+Production+-+A+Definitive+Guidebook+%287th+Ed%29%28gnv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a92180f194be76ca7707df7b0115a642caeaff92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,33,128,241,148,190,118,202,119,7,223,123,1,21,166,66,202,234,255,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
