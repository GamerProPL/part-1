They were subsequently banned from many mainstream U.S. radio stations and even at times prevented from touring - yet the group has still sold over 9 million units in the U.S. alone. Their second album, Straight Outta Compton, marked the beginning of the new gangsta rap era as the production and the social commentary in their lyrics were revolutionary within the genre.[1] Rolling Stone ranked N.W.A 83rd on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.[3] Although largely unknown at the group's inception, rappers Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy-E and MC Ren would all go on to be platinum-selling stars as solo artists.\n\nCompton-based former drug dealer Eazy-E began Ruthless Records with Jerry Heller.[4][1] Ruthless released N.W.A. and the Posse in 1987 with Macola Records. N.W.A. was still in its developing stages, and only credited on four of the eleven tracks, notably the uncharacteristic electro hop record &quot;Panic Zone&quot;, &quot;8Ball&quot;, and &quot;Dopeman&quot;, which first brought together (on wax) Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Eazy-E. Also included was Eazy-E's solo record &quot;Boyz-n-the Hood&quot;.[5] In 1988, rapper MC Ren joined the group.[1]\n\n[b] &quot;The World's Most Dangerous Group&quot; [/b]\n\nN.W.A. released Straight Outta Compton in 1988. With its famous opening salvo of three songs, the group reflected the rising anger of the urban youth. &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; introduced the group; &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot; protested police brutality and racial profiling, and &quot;Gangsta Gangsta&quot; painted the worldview of the inner-city youth. While the group was later credited with pioneering the burgeoning subgenre of gangsta rap, N.W.A in fact referred to their music as &quot;reality rap&quot;.[6]\n\nDr. Dre and DJ Yella, asHighPowered Productions, composed the beats for each song, with Dre making occasional rapping appearances.[7] Ice Cube and MC Ren wrote the lyrics. &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot;, perhaps the group's most notorious song, brought them into conflict with various law enforcement agencies. Under pressure from Focus on the Family,[8] Milt Ahlerich, an assistant director of the FBI, sent a letter to Ruthless and its parent company Priority Records advising the rappers that &quot;advocating violence and assault is wrong and we in the law enforcement community take exception to such action&quot;. This letter can still be seen at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio.[9] Policemen refused to provide security for the group's concerts, hurting their plans to tour. Nonetheless, the FBI's letter only served to draw more publicity to the group. Straight Outta Compton was also one of the first albums to adhere to the new Parental Advisory label scheme, then in its early stages: the now-iconic label then only consisted of &quot;WARNING: Moderate impact coarse language and/or themes&quot;. However, the taboo nature of N.W.A's music was the greatest part of its mass appeal. The media coverage compensated for N.W.A's virtual lack of airplay and their album eventually went double platinum.[10]\n\nOne month after Straight Outta Compton, Eazy-E's solo debut was released. Eazy-Duz-It was dominated by Eazy's persona - MC Ren, appearing on two songs, was the only guest rapper - but behind the scenes it was a group effort. Music was handled by Dr. Dre and DJ Yella, and the lyrics were largely written by Ren, with contributions from Ice Cube and The D.O.C. The album was another platinum success for Ruthless (in addition to girl group J.J. Fad in 1988 and singer Michel'le in 1989), also going double.[11] 1989 saw the re-issue of Straight Outta Compton on compact disc, and the release of The D.O.C.'s No One Can Do It Better. The album was essentially a collaboration between &quot;The D.O.C. and The Doctor&quot; and notably free of &quot;gangsta rap content&quot;, but culminated in the N.W.A posse cut &quot;The Grand FinalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©&quot;. It would be another number one album for the group.\n\n\n\n\n\nStraight Outta Compton \n\n\n\nStraight Outta Compton is the second studio album by Compton, California-based hip hop group N.W.A, released August 8, 1988 on group member Eazy-E's record label Ruthless Records. The production developed mainly from Dr. Dre with DJ Yella giving co-production. The album is generally seen as the pioneering record of gangsta rap; with its ever-present profanity and violent lyrics, it helped to birth the new sub-genre of hip hop. The album was a hip hop groundbreaker that went on to have an enormous impact on the evolution of gangsta rap.[1]\n\nStraight Outta Compton redefined the direction of hip hop,[2] which resulted in lyricism concerning the &quot;gangsta lifestyle&quot; becoming the driving force with sales figures. It also helped to shift the power to the West Coast from the East Coast,[3] which had enjoyed a period of prominence in hip hop for most of the 1980s. It was later re-released on September 24, 2002 as a remastered edition with four bonus tracks. An extended version of the album was released on December 4, 2007, the 20th anniversary of the original album.\n\nThe album reached double platinum sales status, becoming the first album to reach platinum status with no airplay support and without any major tours.[1][5]\n\nAs the hip hop community worldwide received the album with a high note, the members of N.W.A became the top stars for the emerging new era of gangsta rap while popularizing the rap of Ice Cube. The album also helped to spawn many young MC's and gangsta rap groups from areas such as Compton, California and South Central Los Angeles, as many thought they had the same story to tell and the ability to pursue the career track that N.W.A had taken,[6] hence groups such as Compton's Most Wanted coming into fusion.[7]\n\nBecause of the recurring violent and sexual lyrics and profanity, often specifically directed at governmental organizations such as the LAPD, N.W.A always enjoyed a particular repudiation from U.S. Senators and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). This situation persisted over the years with the group's visible head, Eazy-E. One of the reasons for this was the highly controversial track from the album, &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot;, which resulted in the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service sending a letter to Ruthless Records informing the label of their displeasure with the song's message, and N.W.A were banned from performing at several venues.\n\nThe album's most controversial track, &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot;, was partly responsible for the fame of N.W.A as the &quot;World's Most Dangerous Group&quot;, and it did not appear in the album's censored version.[9] The song &quot;Gangsta Gangsta&quot; talks about the danger and violence in South Central and Compton. &quot;Express Yourself&quot; speaks of the ideas of free expression and the constraints placed on rappers by radio censorship. Every N.W.A member except DJ Yella recorded a solo song. Dr. Dre, who mostly produced more than performed, did a solo effort in the single &quot;Express Yourself&quot;. Ice Cube performed on &quot;I Ain't tha 1&quot; and &quot;A Bitch Iz a Bitch&quot;. MC Ren made his solo performance in the songs &quot;If It Ain't Ruff&quot; and &quot;Quiet on tha Set&quot;. Eazy-E's only solo recording was a remix of the song &quot;8 Ball&quot; which appeared on N.W.A's previous album N.W.A and the Posse. The only guests on the album were Ruthless Records ghostwriter, The D.O.C., who appeared on &quot;Parental Discretion Iz Advised&quot;, rapping the intro, and original N.W.A member, Arabian Prince, who contributed minor vocals on &quot;Something 2 Dance 2&quot;.\nSeven tracks from the album were released on N.W.A's Greatest Hits: &quot;Gangsta Gangsta&quot;, &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot;, &quot;Straight Outta Compton (extended mix)&quot;, &quot;If It Ain't Ruff&quot;, &quot;I Ain't tha 1&quot;, &quot;Express Yourself&quot; and the bonus track from its remastered version, &quot;A Bitch Iz a Bitch&quot;.\n\n\nLyrics\n\nThe lyrics on the album were mainly written by Ice Cube.[10][1] Critics of the album expressed their view that the record glamorized Black-on-Black crime, but the rappers stated that they were simply showing the reality of living in the areas of Compton, California and South Central Los Angeles.[6] Allmusic's Steve Huey states that the lyrics are all about &quot;raising hell&quot; and also noted the album for its humor, which he says has been lost in modern lyricism.[1]\n\nMany critics feel that the albums' lyrics glamorize gang violence. The Washington Post writer David Mills wrote: &quot;The hard-core street rappers defend their violent lyrics as a reflection of 'reality.' But for all the gunshots they mix into their music, rappers rarely try to dramatize that reality ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a young man flat on the ground, a knot of lead in his chest, pleading as death slowly takes him in. It's easier for them to imagine themselves pulling the trigger&quot;. However, Wichita Eagle-Beacon editor Bud Norman noted that &quot;They [N.W.A] don't make it sound like much fun... They describe it with the same nonjudgmental resignation that a Kansan might use about a tornado.&quot;[11]\n\n\nProduction \n\nThe production on the album was generally seen as top-quality for that point in time,[10] with Dr. Dre's production performing well with his instrumentals and drum machine beats, and DJ Yella's turntable scratches and overall co-production seen as proficient by hip hop critics. But some other critics thought it was also little sparse for the sheer significance of the album and how the low budget doesn't show up well compared to modern production\n\n\n\nSales and Certifications \n\n\nThe album has sold over three million copies[8][12] and was certified double Platinum on March 27, 1992.[13] It was N.W.A's best selling album, as their debut, N.W.A and the Posse, was certified Gold.[14] Their final album, Niggaz4Life, was certified platinum.[15] According to Priority Records' calculations, 80% of sales were in the suburbs, beyond the boundaries of black neighborhoods.[16]\n\nThe album first appeared on music charts in 1989, peaking on the U.S. Billboard 200 at number thirty-seven, and peaking on Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums at number nine.[17] It re-entered the charts in 2003, peaking on the UK Albums Top 75 at number thirty-five, and on the Ireland Albums Top 75 at number twenty.[18]\n\n\nCritical \n\nThe album was generally well received by critics. Richmond Times-Dispatch's Mark Holmberg described the album as &quot;a preacher-provoking, mother-maddening, reality-stinks diatribe that wallows in gangs, doping, drive-by shootings, brutal sexism, cop slamming and racism&quot;[11]. Newsweek noted that Straight Outta Compton &quot;introduced some of the most grotesquely exciting music ever made&quot;. A Newsweek reviewer added, &quot;Hinting at gang roots, and selling themselves on those hints, they project a gangster mystique that pays no attention where criminality begins and marketing lets off&quot;.[11] Following its 2002 re-release, Jon Caramanica of Rolling Stone magazine cited Straight Outta Compton as one of hip-hop's most crucial albums, calling it a &quot;bombastic, cacophonous car ride through Los Angeles' burnt-out and ignored hoods.&quot;[19]\n\n\nAccolades \n\nIn 2003, the TV network, VH1, named Straight Outta Compton the 62nd greatest album of all time. It was ranked ten in Spin magazine's &quot;100 Greatest Albums, 1985-2005&quot;. In 1998, the album was selected as one of The Source's 100 Best Rap Albums. It is the group's only album on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (ranked #144), and the first hip-hop album ever to get a 5-star rating from them in their initial review, and when comedian Chris Rock wrote an article for the magazine about the 25 Greatest Hip-Hop Albums of all time in 2005, Straight Outta Compton was number one on his list.[20] The album was also ranked the 130th best album of all time by Acclaimedmusic.net.[21] In 2006, the album was listed in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.[22] The same year, TIME Magazine ranked it as one of the 100 greatest albums of all time.[23] Q magazine voted it one of the 'Top 50 Titles Of 1989. Alternative Press ( 7/95, p.88 ) ranked it #45 in AP's list of the 'Top 99 Of '85-'95'. Vibe (12/99, p.164) included it in Vibe's 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century.\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\nStraight Outta Compton\nFuck Tha Police\nGangsta Gangsta\nIf It AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Ruff\nParental Discretion Iz Advised\n8 Ball (remix)\nSomething Like That\nExpress yourself\nComptonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in the House\nI AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Tha 1\nDopeman (remix)\nQuiet on that Set\nSomething 2 Dance 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreatest Hits\n\n\nGreatest Hits (N.W.A) is an album originally released on July 2, 1996.
