It will require updates if you wish to play online. \n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://aow2.heavengames.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://aow2.heavengames.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nIf you would like system Requirements or any information about the Games please see the sites. These ISOs contain the Cracks to allow play without the Game disk, Though I have found on my computer I MUST mount the image every time you wish to play Wizards Throne or it will not load with or without the crack.\n\nHowever I would advise burning a copy to disk. Some features of the game a slowed having to run as an ISO\n\nNote:\nI was without a com for a while but now i am back and this torrent is back up and running.  I have also transferred a copy to my other com, and my brother-in-laws com and I will seed there too. Sorry about the massive delay. \n\nCurrent date: May 26, 2009","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44d297cc77d99fe2b7d3c1a3a1c2c5e1b5f3ec5f","amp;dn":"Age+of+Wonders+2+-+Wizards+Throne+%2B+Shadow+Magic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44d297cc77d99fe2b7d3c1a3a1c2c5e1b5f3ec5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,210,151,204,119,217,159,226,183,211,193,163,161,194,197,225,181,243,236,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
