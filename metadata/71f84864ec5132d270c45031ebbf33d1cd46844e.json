The first half of the album is a development of their unique brand of arena rock which had evolved in their music since the 1980 album Making Movies, while the second half consists of more folk-influenced material. The whole album maintains the original Dire Straits' bluesy and laid back guitar-based sound whilst retaining a more lavish and bombastic production and overall sound. It is the band's best selling album.\n\nAlbum Title: Brothers In Arms \nArtist | Group: Dire Straits \nLabel: Vertigo \nRelease date: 1985 \nGenre: Rock \nNumber of track(s): 9 \nFile format: mp3 \nTotal duration: 00h:55m:16s:815ms \nTotal size: 126.4414 MB\n\nTrack List:\nSo Far Away\nMoney For Nothing\nWalk Of Life\nYour Latest Trick\nWhy Worry\nRide Across The River\nThe Man's Too Strong\nOne World\nBrothers In Arms\n\nENJOY\nplease seed and leave feedback\nvigoni","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71f84864ec5132d270c45031ebbf33d1cd46844e","amp;dn":"Dire+Straits+-+Brothers+In+Arms+%5B1985+-+MP3+-+320+kbps%5D+%5Bvigoni%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71f84864ec5132d270c45031ebbf33d1cd46844e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,248,72,100,236,81,50,210,112,196,80,49,235,191,51,209,205,70,132,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
