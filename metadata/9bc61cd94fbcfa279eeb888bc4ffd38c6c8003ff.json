The series is about an &quot;average computer-whiz-next-door&quot; who receives an encoded e-mail from an old college friend now working in the CIA; the message embeds the only remaining copy of the world's greatest spy secrets into Chuck's brain.\n\nProduced by College Hill Pictures, Fake Empire, Wonderland Sound and Vision and Warner Bros. Television, the series premiered on September 24, 2007, on NBC, airing on Monday nights at 8/7c. Season 5 will air on Friday nights at 8/7c. The show was aired in India and the rest of south Asia on Animax.\n\nChuck was renewed and began in January 2010 for a third season following a campaign mounted by fans to have the network renew the show.
