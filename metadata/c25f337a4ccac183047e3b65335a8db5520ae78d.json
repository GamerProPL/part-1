Carlin and his &quot;Seven Dirty Words&quot; comedy routine were central to the 1978 U.S. Supreme Court case F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, in which a narrow 5-4 decision by the justices affirmed the government&amp;#039;s right to regulate Carlin&amp;#039;s act on the public airwaves.\n\nGeorge Carlin&amp;#039;s most recent stand up routines are primarily focused on attacking the flaws in modern-day America. He often takes on contemporary political issues in the United States and satirizes the excesses of American culture.\n\nHe is considered by many to be a successor to the late Lenny Bruce and was described by Comedy Central as the second greatest stand-up comedian of all time behind Richard Pryor, and right before Lenny Bruce. He was also the first person to host Saturday Night Live.\n\nThe archive includes 19 albums:\n\n(1963) Burns and Carlin at the Playboy Club\n(1966) Take-Offs and Put-Ons\n(1972) Class Clown\n(1972) FM &amp; AM\n(1973) Occupation Foole\n(1974) Toledo Window Box\n(1975) An Evening with Wally Londo Featuring Bill Slaszo\n(1977) On the Road\n(1981) A Place for My Stuff\n(1984) Carlin on Campus\n(1986) Playin&amp;#039; with Your Head\n(1988) What Am I Doing In New Jersey?\n(1990) Parental Advisory- Explicit Lyrics\n(1992) Jammin&amp;#039; in New York\n(1996) Back in Town\n(1999) You Are All Diseased\n(2001) Complaints and Grievances\n(2002) George Carlin on Comedy\n(2006) Life Is Worth Losing\n\n3 audio-books:\n\n(1997) Brain Droppings\n(2001) Napalm and Silly Putty\n(2004) When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?\n\nand special:\n\nFree Complimentary (early years - limited).\n\nQUALITY: 128, 160, 192 KBPS (MP3)\n\nALL CREDIT TO THE RIPPERS AND UPLOADERS OF SOULSEEK!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c25f337a4ccac183047e3b65335a8db5520ae78d","amp;dn":"George+Carlin+-+19+albums%2C+3+audio-books%2C+1+special+%28DISCOGRAPHY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c25f337a4ccac183047e3b65335a8db5520ae78d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,95,51,122,76,202,193,131,4,126,59,101,51,90,141,181,82,10,231,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
