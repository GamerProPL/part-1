And they were rightÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ until now. The Renegade Diet makes this possibility a reality by presenting an alternative approach, based on millions of years of evolution, that goes against EVERYTHING youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever learned or believed to be true about nutrition.\nYour body was designed for and adapted to a certain style and pattern of eating that has nothing in common with what most people do today. When you ignore this and follow standard diet advice you end up fatter, smaller and sicker. Statistics show our hunter-gatherer ancestors to have had significantly more muscle and less body-fat than the average person does today.  There were also fewer chronic diseases like those so prevalent nowadays. Before you can worry about fat loss, muscle gain or enhanced performance youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got to get healthy first. Once you get healthy everything else falls into place.\nTo gain muscle without the fat, or get ripped while keeping your hard earned size, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got to unlearn all youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been taught about Ã¢â‚¬Å“healthy eatingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“proper nutritionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and embrace the ways of The Renegade Diet.
