After a break from touring for their 2009 debut album xx, the group's members began writing songs individually before recording the album during November 2011 to May 2012. Guitarist Romy Madley Croft and bassist Oliver Sim drew on personal experiences for their songwriting. For Coexist, The xx drew on the electronic dance music that occurred when they were away on tour in 2010. It was produced by group member Jamie xx, who had pursued electronic dance on other projects and developed as a DJ prior to the album.\n\n\n01 Angels 2:51\n02 Chained 2:47\n03 Fiction 2:56\n04 Try 3:15\n05 Reunion 3:57\n06 Sunset 3:38\n07 Missing 3:33\n08 Tides 3:01\n09 Unfold 3:02\n10 Swept Away 4:59\n11 Our Song 3:13","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a13180a8b28f96c9ab88eab3cd42117f44bffb50","amp;dn":"The+xx-+%282012%29+Coexist++Projeto+Chernobyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a13180a8b28f96c9ab88eab3cd42117f44bffb50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,49,128,168,178,143,150,201,171,136,234,179,205,66,17,127,68,191,251,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
