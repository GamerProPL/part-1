While they could barely get noticed in America, the trio became genuine superstars in Britain, with an impressive string of Top Ten singles in the late '70s and early '80s. The Jam could never have a hit in America because they were thoroughly and defiantly British. Under the direction of guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Paul Weller, the trio spearheaded a revival of mid-'60s mod groups, in the style of the Who and the Small Faces. Like the mod bands, the group dressed stylishly, worshipped American R&amp;B, and played it loud and rough. By the time of the group's third album, Weller's songwriting had grown substantially, as he was beginning to write social commentaries and pop songs in the vein of the Kinks. Both his political songs and his romantic songs were steeped in British culture, filled with references and slang in the lyrics, as well as musical allusions. Furthermore, as the Jam grew more popular and musically accessible, Weller became more insistent and stubborn about his beliefs, supporting leftist causes and adhering to the pop aesthetics of '60s British rock without ever succumbing to hippie values. Paradoxically, that meant even when their music became more pop than punk, they never abandoned the punk values -- if anything, Weller stuck to the strident independent ethics of 1977 more than any other punk band just by simply refusing to change.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\nGenre:\t\t\tPunk\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.In The City\n02.All Around The World\n03.The Modern World\n04.News Of The World\n05.David Watts\n06.Down In The Tube Station At Midnight\n07.Strange Town\n08.When You're Young\n09.The Eton Rifles\n10.Going Underground\n11.Start!\n12.That's Entertainment\n13.Funeral Pyre\n14.Absolute Beginners\n15.Town Called Malice\n16.Precious\n17.Just Who Is The Five O'clock Hero\n18.The Bitterest Pill (I Ever Had To Swallow)\n19.Beat Surrender\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8579ade8caca9ea87682b707a58f9b4cc5a0205b","amp;dn":"The+Jam+-+Greatest+Hits+%281991%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8579ade8caca9ea87682b707a58f9b4cc5a0205b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,121,173,232,202,202,158,168,118,130,183,7,165,143,155,76,197,160,32,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
