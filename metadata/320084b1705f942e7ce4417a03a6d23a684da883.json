You demand a fast, clean, and powerful text editor. Pixel-perfect preview. A built-in way to open and manage your local and remote files. And maybe a dash of SSH. Say hello, Coda.\n\nNew! in Coda 2.5\n\n-Speed. Syntax highlighting is anywhere from 4 to 10 times faster. Symbol parsing is 10 times faster. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s real zippier.\n\n-Editor Improvements. Vertical indentation guides. Customizable column guide. Color-coded traditional or visual tabs.\n\n-Local Indexing. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s here. Site-wide autocomplete of your functions, classes, and variables, all indexed from your local files.\n\n-Plugin Prefs. Manage your existing plugins, and discover new and exciting ones, via CodaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s preferences.\n\n-CSS Overriding. Easily override and edit a siteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CSS, live, right within CodaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Preview.\n\n-Publishing. Coda can now track and publish files modified outside of Coda. Plus a handy Ã¢â‚¬Å“Save and PublishÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ shortcut.\n\n-Panic Sync. Sync your sites, passwords, and private keys to all of your Macs and more. It's free, easy, and extremely secure.\n\nWhat is Coda?\n\nGood question. Coda is everything you need to hand-code a website, in one beautiful app.\n\nWhile the pitch is simple, building Coda was anything but. How do you elegantly wrap everything together? Well, we did it. And today, Coda has grown to be a critical tool for legions of web developers around the world.\n\nMore than anything else, Coda is a text editor. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got everything you expect: syntax highlighting for tons of languages. Code folding. Project-wide autocomplete. Fast find and replace. Indentation guides. Automatic tag closing. Fast commenting and shifting of code. The works. But CodaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s editor has features you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find anywhere else. For example, the Find and Replace has this revolutionary &quot;Wildcard&quot; token that makes RegEx one-button simple. And as you type, Coda Pops let you quickly create colors, gradients, and more, using easy controls. There are nice touches everywhere.\n\nBut an incredible text editor is just a nice typewriter if you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t easily handle all of your files Ã¢â‚¬â€ from anywhere. Coda has battle-tested, deeply integrated file management. Open local files or edit remotely on FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, or Amazon S3 servers. Use the Files tab and move, rename, copy, transfer from server-to-server... anything. Track local changes for remote publishing. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s even support for Git and Subversion.\n\nThen youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll want to see what your code looks like. Use our WebKit Preview, which includes a web inspector, debugger, and profiler. Then, on top of that, we added AirPreview, a revolutionary feature that lets you use your iPad and Diet Coda to Preview pages as you code on your desktop.\n\nBelieve it or not, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve just scratched the surface. Open CodaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sidebar to discover a rich set of utilities that make you work better. Like Clips, which let you create frequently used bits of text that you can insert into your document with special triggers. And project-wide Find and Replace thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll work across multiple files. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also an HTML Validator, a Code Navigator, and more.\n\nFinally, hiding behind the Plus button in the tab bar is a built-in Terminal and MySQL editor, two amazingly powerful Tab Tools. The Terminal can open a local shell or SSH. MySQL lets you define structure, edit data, and more.\n\nAnd itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all wrapped up in our Sites, which get you started quickly. Opening a Site sets your file paths, your root URLs, where your files Publish to, source control settings, and more. And with Panic Sync, our free and secure sync service, your sites follow you on any computer.\n\nCoda is a very good app.\n\nSeed And Enjoy\nIf you like my work vote it good","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:320084b1705f942e7ce4417a03a6d23a684da883","amp;dn":"Coda+2.5.4+%5BMac+Os+X%5D+%5BCoque599%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"320084b1705f942e7ce4417a03a6d23a684da883","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,0,132,177,112,95,148,46,124,228,65,122,3,166,210,58,104,77,168,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
