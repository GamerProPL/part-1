So it would be usefull only if you love the YAMAHA CP-80. It seemed to have a litle bug wen loading into memory, but you may ommit that. DonÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t Worry. It works FINE!\n\nPianoteq is a high-class virtual instrument using breakthrough technology, available for PC and Mac as a VST/AU/RTAS plugin and stand-alone player.\n\nPianoteq is issued from an academic research and results in what we call the fourth piano generation. This is the very first, and only, piano available that belongs to this generation.\n\nFirst generation: acoustic piano (1698)\nSecond generation: electro acoustic piano (1929)\nThird generation: sampled piano (1984)\nFourth generation: modelled piano (2006)\nThe first generation of pianos began with Cristofori&amp;#039;s pianoforte in 1698 which came to maturity at the end of the 19th century with the acoustic grand pianos. It was followed in the 20th century by the second generation electro-acoustic pianos and the third generation sampled pianos where each note is a recording of how it sounded during a specific moment in time, not taking into account the complexity of the instrument.\n\nPianoteq is the first and only piano belonging to the fourth generation, developed in order to go beyond the limitations of the third generation and to become a versatile and innovating tool. It is in fact the first virtual piano factory ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it can produce new brands as well as copies of historical instruments.\n\nPianoteq is available for Windows XP/Vista and MacOS X 10.3.9 and up (Universal Binary). There is also a native Receptor version available.\n\nThe Pianoteq sound\nVivid\nThe piano creates the sound in real time while you are playing and takes into account all the complex factors that makes the piano a truly vivid instrument, such as the interaction between strings, the use of pedals, the cabinet resonance and the position of the hammers. It will feel like you had a real piano in front of you... as if you could just lean over and touch the strings!\n\nVersatile\nPianoteq introduces new possibilities to adjust the piano sound just the way you like it! Things that until now were dedicated for piano tuners are now possible directly from the interface. Within seconds you can adjust the sound to a particular type of music or playing style. The many choices can be saved as a customized setting which you can share with other Pianoteq users.\n\nExpressive\nAll the detailed variations of the timbre are there, from the weakest pianissimo to the strongest fortissimo! What you express on your keyboard will also be what you actually hear. The sound of even the weakest pianissimo is absolutely pure without any audible quantization noise.\n\nConvenient\nThanks to its rather modest system requirements, Pianoteq is suitable to run on a modern laptop, convenient for the travelling musician. The extremely small size (8 MB) and the fast interface means no loading time. Just a few mouse movements to start playing.\n\nThe Pianoteq technology\nCharacteristics of Pianoteq\nThe piano sound is constructed in real time, responding to how the pianist strikes the keys and interacts with the pedals\nIt includes the entire complexity of a real piano (hammers, strings, duplex scale, pedals, cabinet)\nNo quantization noise (32-bit internal sampling at 192 KHz)\nReal progressive variation of the timbre (127 velocities per note)\nAdjustable hammer hardness (voicing) and other similar parameters\nAdjustable unison width (tuning) and other similar parameters\nAdjustable piano size (soundboard) and other similar parameters\nAdjustable spectrum profile, based on the first 8 overtones\nProgressive sustain pedal, allowing partial-pedal effects\nSostenuto pedal, harmonic pedal and Una Corda (soft) pedal\nMicrotuning with Scala format\nLid position (open, half-open, closed)\nStereo width slider\nKey release velocity\nVery fast to install and initialize\nTotal size is about 15 MB (MegaBytes)\nIt can be used successfully with a laptop (low hardware requirements)\nAdjustable optional samples of acoustic noises (pedal and key release)\nBuilt-in graphic equalizer with freely adjustable key points\nBuilt-in graphic velocity curve with keyboard presets\nBuilt-in reverb unit with presets\n\nPianoteq interface\nThe many adjustable parameters make it possible to not only adapt the existing adapted piano model but also to create new piano sounds. This is one of the advantages of a truly modelled piano ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it opens up new possibilities for the creative musician.\n\nPianoteq gives you all the possibilities to do several tuning improvements which are usually done only by piano tuners. Example: diapason (414-467 Hz), different kinds of temperaments (from equal to well tempered), microtuning, unison tuning (for changing the timbre or colour of the sound), octave stretching and direct sound duration.\n\nAnother task for a professional piano tuner is to &quot;shape&quot; the piano sound according to the pianist&amp;#039;s taste. By adjusting hammer hardness it is possible to adapt the piano sound from mellow to bright in great detail. There is not just one adjustment, mellow to bright, but a very detailed slider for each major velocity: pianissimo, mezzoforte and fortissimo.\n\nThe next feature is something that not even a piano tuner can do ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ changing the soundboard impedance. You will get a total control of overtones. This makes it even possible to change the size of the piano, from A size to D size, even up to a 10 meter (33 feet) grand!\n\nOverview of the available parameters:\nTo provide you with more possibilities in one package there is also a graphical equalizer and a reverb unit. Of course you can bypass any of these if you prefer other effects plug-ins.\n\nYou can also in detail adjust the velocity curve for your particular keyboard to insure that you get the expression that suits you the best.\n\nIt can be used as a stand-alone player and with any VST or Audio Units host such as Cubase, Logic, Nuendo... It can also be used as an RTAS plugin with Pro Tools version 7.3 and higher.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a674fbceb7e4138a990366cf84ed7317510196f3","amp;dn":"PianoTeq+v2.3+%2B+Addons+%2B+Presets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a674fbceb7e4138a990366cf84ed7317510196f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,116,251,206,183,228,19,138,153,3,102,207,132,237,115,23,81,1,150,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
