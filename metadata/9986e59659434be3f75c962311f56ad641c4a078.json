As a bassist, he knew few peers, blessed with a powerful tone and pulsating sense of rhythm, capable of elevating the instrument into the front line of a band. But had he been just a string player, few would know his name today. Rather, he was the greatest bass-playing leader/composer jazz has ever known, one who always kept his ears and fingers on the pulse, spirit, spontaneity, and ferocious expressive power of jazz.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps \nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tJazz\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tAtlantic\t\t\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Pithecanthropus Erectus\n02.Profile Of Jackie\n03.Tonight At Noon\n04.Haitian Fight Song\n05.Reincarnation Of A Lovebird\n06.Moanin'\n07.Cryin' Blues\n08.Wednesday Night Prayer Meeting\n09.Ecclusiastics\n10.Passions Of A Man\n11.Wham Bam Thank You Ma'am\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                   ****Please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9986e59659434be3f75c962311f56ad641c4a078","amp;dn":"Charles+Mingus+-+The+Very+Best+Of++%282001%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9986e59659434be3f75c962311f56ad641c4a078","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,134,229,150,89,67,75,227,247,92,150,35,17,245,106,214,65,196,160,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
