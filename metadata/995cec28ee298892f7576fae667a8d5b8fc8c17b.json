We now know that there were at least four other distinct species of human on the planet at the same time as us - some of them identified from astonishingly well-preserved DNA extracted from 50,000-year-old bones, others hinted at by archaic sections of DNA hidden in our modern genome. What's more, we now know that our ancestors met and interacted with these other humans, in ways that still have ramifications today. Alice uses these revelations to update our picture of the human family tree.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ee/The-Lost-Tribes-of-Humanity-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/04/The-Lost-Tribes-of-Humanity-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3e/The-Lost-Tribes-of-Humanity-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8e/The-Lost-Tribes-of-Humanity-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/79/The-Lost-Tribes-of-Humanity-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a9/The-Lost-Tribes-of-Humanity-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c1/The-Lost-Tribes-of-Humanity-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/23/The-Lost-Tribes-of-Humanity-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/94/The-Lost-Tribes-of-Humanity-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 1205 Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 832 x 468\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\r\nAudio: English\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 59 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 564 MB\r\nSource: PDTV\r\nEncoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English subtitles\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07z8034","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:995cec28ee298892f7576fae667a8d5b8fc8c17b","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+2016+The+Lost+Tribes+Of+Humanity+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"995cec28ee298892f7576fae667a8d5b8fc8c17b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,92,236,40,238,41,136,146,247,87,111,174,102,122,141,91,143,200,193,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
