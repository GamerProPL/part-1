Sung in the Songhai language, pushed by a vaguely reggae groove and pulled along by a sometimes idiosyncratic percussion line on a calabash, it pretty well epitomizes what Toure is about.\n \nOn Ã¢â‚¬Å“The RiverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the sound is stripped down, with the guitar and voice working a bare minimum groove. The calabash clicks, a thick stringed ngoni adds some punch, and a few tracks feature Toure on the njarka (fiddle). In addition to Rory McLeod's harmonica, there is one piece with The Chieftains' Seane Keane and Kevin Conneff on fiddle and bodhran (Irish goatskin drum), and a marvelous duet with saxophonist Steve Williamson that adds a little sideways R&amp;B.\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The RiverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is one of Toure's most straightforward recordings made in the decade after the light of his international fame had first shone.\n\n\n\nAli Farka TourÃƒÂ©\n\nThe River\n\n1990\n\n\n  CD / 1990 / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
