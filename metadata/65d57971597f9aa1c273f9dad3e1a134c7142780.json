The application itself injects a SLIC (System Licensed Internal Code) into your system before Windows boots; this is what fools Windows into thinking it's genuine.\n\nThe things you might want to know\n\nIt works on 32-bit and 64-bit systems\nIt's compatible with Windows 7 SP1 and all system updates\nIt's compatible with all system languages\nIt can be used to pre-activate Windows\nIt allows you to install custom OEM information\nIt features application integrity checking\nIt supports hidden partitions and some complex setups\nIt can work alongside Linux's GRUB or any other boot manager\nIt works with VMware, VirtualBox and Hyper-V\nIt works with most hard drive encryption software e.g. TrueCrypt or BitLocker\nIt allows you to add your own certificates and serials externally\nIt will install just the certificate and serial for users with an existing SLIC\nIt features automated system profiling (The application matches everything up for you)\nIt won't modify any system files\nIt runs before Windows is launched\nNo extra processes are run so you have nothing eating at your RAM\nAll key parts of the loader are encrypted with a custom encryption\nEvery user has a unique version of the loader installed on his or her system\n\nSupported operating systems\n\nWindows 7 Ultimate\nWindows 7 Ultimate E\nWindows 7 Professional\nWindows 7 Professional E\nWindows 7 Home Premium\nWindows 7 Home Premium E\nWindows 7 Home Basic\nWindows 7 Starter\nWindows 7 Starter E\nWindows Vista Ultimate\nWindows Vista Business\nWindows Vista Business N\nWindows Vista Home Premium\nWindows Vista Home Basic\nWindows Vista Home Basic N\nWindows Vista Starter\nWindows Server 2008 Enterprise\nWindows Server 2008 Enterprise (Without Hyper-V)\nWindows Server 2008 Foundation\nWindows Server 2008 Standard\nWindows Small Business Server 2008\nWindows Storage Server 2008 Standard\nWindows Storage Server 2008 R2 Essentials\nWindows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise\nWindows Server 2008 R2 Foundation\nWindows Server 2008 R2 Standard\nWindows Server 2008 R2 Datacenter\nWindows Small Business Server 2011 Standard\nWindows Small Business Server 2011 Essentials\nWindows Home Server 2011\nWindows Server 2012 Standard\nWindows Server 2012 Essentials\nWindows Server 2012 Foundation\nWindows Server 2012 Datacenter\nWindows Storage Server 2012 Standard\nWindows Storage Server 2012 Workgroup\nWindows MultiPoint Server 2012 Standard\nWindows MultiPoint Server 2012 Premium\nWindows Server 2012 R2 Standard\n\nNote: You must be running build 7600 or greater for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.\nNote: I don't recommend using any of the Windows 7 E editions.\n\nApplication integrity checking?\nHover your mouse over the green, amber or red icon to see detailed application information.\nNote: Even if the icon is green someone might have found a way around the protection system so it's worth checking that the applications path is always the same as the location from which you launched the application. You should also check that the MD5 matches the MD5 found online.\n\nVirus scanner results\nAll virus scanner detection's are a false-positive as long as the MD5 matches. Simply turn off your anti-virus while installing the loader.\n\nNote to uploaders\nPlease tell people to read the read me file as it contains answers to many of the activation problems people have.\n\nChangelog:\n--\nVersion 2.2.2 (04/02/2014)\n* Added support for Windows Server 2012 R2 operating systems\n* Added a valid OEM SLP key for Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard (it was taken from a Dell server)\n* Added a warning for virtual machines created in VirtualBox that are using Windows Server 2012 or 2012 R2 (use ICH9 for the loader to work)\n* Allowed the loader to be installed onto Xen again (if it doesn't work for you then it can't be fixed)\n* Added lots of new keys, SLIC's and certificates\n* Cleaned up the UI\n* Other minor tweaks and fixes\n\nEXE MD5: 323c0fd51071400b51eedb1be90a8188\nEXE SHA-1: 0efc35935957c25193bbe9a83ab6caa25a487ada\n\nWant to &quot;Thank&quot; Daz? head over to: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/24901-Windows-Loader-Current-release-information?p=120996&amp;viewfull=1#post120996&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/24901-Windows-Loader-Current-release-information?p=120996&amp;viewfull=1#post120996&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLooking for help with getting this to work on your system?: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/24902-Windows-Loader-Support-and-chat&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/24902-Windows-Loader-Support-and-chat&lt;/a&gt;\n\nmurph-note: This activates by modifying MBR partitions (BIOS-Boot)\nIt loads OEM activation into memory so the OS think's you're activated.\nIt does NOT work on GPT partitioned drives (UEFI-Boot)\nThere is a project for emulating what the loader does on a UEFI system, it's called WindSLIC: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/29740-WindSLIC-UEFI-SLIC-injector&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/29740-WindSLIC-UEFI-SLIC-injector&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy Pirates,\nand make sure to thank Daz if you haven't already.\nmurphy78 TPB/MDL","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65d57971597f9aa1c273f9dad3e1a134c7142780","amp;dn":"Windows+Loader+v2.2.2+Daz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65d57971597f9aa1c273f9dad3e1a134c7142780","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,213,121,113,89,127,154,161,194,115,249,218,211,225,161,52,199,20,39,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
