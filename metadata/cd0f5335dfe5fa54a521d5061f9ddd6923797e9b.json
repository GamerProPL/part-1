Every one of her 12 singles for the label is here, with the Jamie Hartman duet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStalemateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ -- originally released on BenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s BrotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 2009 album -- added as a concluding track. If this doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t dig deep, it nevertheless hits all the highlights  -- her White Stripes cover ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFell in Love with a Boy,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ her Top Ten U.K. hit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou Had Me,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Cha Wanna Ride,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ her only charting U.S. single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTell Me 'Bout It,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the Common duet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTell Me What WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re Gonna Do NowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ -- drawing a picture of the decade when Stone was always on the cusp of stardom yet never quite truly there. As introductions go, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a solid one, capturing her potential and promise, alternating between singles frustrating and fun. ~Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n[img]http://i896.photobucket.com/albums/ac169/pbf99/tr.gif[/img]\n\n01.
