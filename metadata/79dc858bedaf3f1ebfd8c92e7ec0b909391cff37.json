Where the Pistols were nihilistic, the Clash were fiery and idealistic, charged with righteousness and a leftist political ideology. From the outset, the band was more musically adventurous, expanding its hard rock &amp; roll with reggae, dub, and rockabilly among other roots musics. Furthermore, they were blessed with two exceptional songwriters in Joe Strummer and Mick Jones, each with a distinctive voice and style. The Clash copped heavily from classic outlaw imagery, positioning themselves as rebels with a cause. As a result, they won a passionately devoted following on both sides of the Atlantic. While they became rock &amp; roll heroes in the U.K., second only to the Jam in terms of popularity, it took the Clash several years to break into the American market, and when they finally did in 1982, they imploded several months later. Though the Clash never became the superstars they always threatened to become, they restored passion and protest to rock &amp; roll. For a while, they really did seem like &quot;the only band that mattered.&quot; \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\nLabel:\t\t\tSony\n\n\nSome would argue that if you only wanted two Clash discs in your collection, you should skip this 40-track overview and pick up The Clash and London Calling instead. No matter how transcendent those two albums are -- and they are among the very greatest popular music of the 20th century -- that overlooks the fact that the group had many, many great songs not on either album, including &quot;Safe European Home,&quot; &quot;Stay Free,&quot; &quot;Bankrobber,&quot; &quot;Rock the Casbah,&quot; &quot;Straight to Hell,&quot; &quot;This Is Radio Clash,&quot; and &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go,&quot; to begin with. That's where this 2003 compilation comes in. It fills in many of the gaps between those two records, while summarizing The Clash and London Calling well, providing a first-rate overview of the greatest punk band. It's not quite perfect, however: some great singles and B-sides fall through the cracks (notably &quot;Gates of the West,&quot; &quot;Jail Guitar Doors,&quot; &quot;The Call Up,&quot; &quot;Armagedion Time,&quot; &quot;The Prisoner,&quot; &quot;Protex Blue&quot;) and the Sandinista! selections feel nearly as haphazard as the album itself. Nevertheless, this does provide the best, most extensive and logical overview of the band yet assembled, and it's worthwhile not just as an introduction, but as a terrific listen.\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\nDisc One\n\n01.White Riot\n02.London's Burning\n03.Complete Control\n04.Clash City Rockers (Original Version)\n05.I'm So Bored With The U.S.A.\n06.Career Opportunities\n07.Hate &amp; War\n08.Cheat\n09.Police &amp; Thieves\n10.Janie Jones\n11.Garageland\n12.Capital Radio One\n13.(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais\n14.English Civil War\n15.Tommy Gun\n16.Safe European Home\n17.Julie's Been Working For The Drug Squad\n18.Stay Free\n19.Groovy Times\n20.I Fought The Law\n\n\nDisc Two\n\n01.London Calling\n02.The Guns Of Brixton\n03.Clampdown\n04.Rudie Can't Fail\n05.Lost In The Supermarket\n06.Jimmy Jazz\n07.Train In Vain (Stand By Me)\n08.Bankrobber\n09.The Magnificent Seven\n10.Ivan Meets G.I.
