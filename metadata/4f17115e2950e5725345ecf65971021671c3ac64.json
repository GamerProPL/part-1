Media Player Classic can do this, but to get it to load automatically, you need to rename the .SRT file match the name of the movie. So rename &quot;L Change the World[Eng][Subs].srt&quot; to &quot;L Change the World[2008]DvDrip[JAP]-FXG.srt&quot;\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nDeath Note [2006]\nDeath Note 2: The Last Name [2006]\nL - Change the World [2008]\n\nThe three Death Note movies! Movies 1&amp;2 have the SARS subs, where there's no grammatical/spelling errors, and the Shinigami speak in a different script. This version is much harder to get, and a lot better, so I recommend this torrent very much.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f17115e2950e5725345ecf65971021671c3ac64","amp;dn":"Death+Note+Movie+Trilogy+%28perfect+subs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f17115e2950e5725345ecf65971021671c3ac64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,23,17,94,41,80,229,114,83,69,236,246,89,113,2,22,113,195,172,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
