What Are You Hungry For? is the breakthrough book that can bring weight under effortless control by linking it to personal fulfillment in every area of a reader's life.\n\nWhat are you hungry for? Food? Love? Self-esteem?  Peace? In this manual for &quot;higher health,&quot; based on the latest findings in both mainstream and alternative medicine, Deepak Chopra creates a vision of weight loss based on a deeper awareness of why people overeat - because they are trying to find satisfaction and wind up using food as a substitute for real fulfillment.  Repudiating the failed approaches of crash dieting and all forms of deprivation, Chopra's new book aims directly at the problem of finding fulfillment.  When that problem is solved, he argues, normal eating falls into place automatically, and the entire system of mind and body achieves what it really desires.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“EveryoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life story is complicated, and the best intentions go astray because people find it hard to change,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ writes Chopra. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bad habits, like bad memories, stick around stubbornly when we wish theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d go away. But you have a great motivation working for you, which is your desire for happiness. I define happiness as the state of fulfillment, and everyone wants to be fulfilled. If you keep your eye on this, your most basic motivation, then the choices you make come down to a single question: Ã¢â‚¬Å“What am I hungry for?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Your true desire will lead you in the right direction. False desires lead in the wrong direction.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fbcef4a9d1c6d131d3655691ed1bcf7d548a34f","amp;dn":"What+Are+You+Hungry+For+-+Deepak+Chopra.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fbcef4a9d1c6d131d3655691ed1bcf7d548a34f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,188,239,74,157,28,109,19,29,54,85,105,30,209,188,247,213,72,163,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
