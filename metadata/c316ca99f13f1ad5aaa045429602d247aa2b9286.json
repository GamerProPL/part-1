The SRU are tasked to resolve extreme situations that regular officers are not trained to handle including hostage-taking, bomb threats and heavily armed criminals. Equipped with high-tech tools and a cache of weapons and explosives, members use negotiation tactics and intuition to try to avoid the use of force.\n\n\nEpiosde order\n\nThe order of episodes seems to be a kind of confusing matter - so I post the link to the current episode order listed by CTV on their site at present.\n\nCTV's List of Episodes:\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://shows.ctv.ca/FlashPoint/Episodes.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://shows.ctv.ca/FlashPoint/Episodes.aspx&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe Complete Season 2\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6158845&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6158845&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Complete Season 3\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6158516&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6158516&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFormat :\tXviD\nFile size:  \t349MiB avg per episode\nDuration : \t42min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t624 pixels\nHeight : \t352 pixels\nAspect ratio : \t16:9\nFrame rate : \t23.976fps\nAudio: \t\tMP3\nNr. of Files:\t9 + 1 TitlePic\n\n\nAll files properly named.\nThis time credits go to GAA on\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n##################  You like your show in one pack?  ##################\n########################  Here you go!  ########################\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/man-o-tor/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/man-o-tor/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;\n\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-\nList of Episodes:\n\nS01E01 -Scorpio-\nThe team has to deal with a disturbed man who has just murdered his estranged wife and who has now taken a woman hostage outside of an office building.
