One computer runs the simulation and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“main screenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, while the others serve as workstations for the normal jobs a bridge officer might do, like Helm, Communication, Engineering, and Weapon Control. Artemis is a social game where several players are together in one room (Ã¢â‚¬Å“bridgeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) , and while they all work together, one player plays the Captain, a person who sits in the middle, doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a workstation, and tells everyone what to do.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1227133d136eb93f1ac4989d2d25c754ce2a2f9e","amp;dn":"Artemis+Spaceship+Bridge+Simulator+2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1227133d136eb93f1ac4989d2d25c754ce2a2f9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,39,19,61,19,110,185,63,26,196,152,157,45,37,199,84,206,42,47,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
