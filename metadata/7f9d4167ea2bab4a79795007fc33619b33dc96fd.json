His earliest novels, published in the 1950s, were Westerns, but Leonard went on to specialize in crime fiction and suspense thrillers, many of which have been adapted into motion pictures. Among his best-known works are Get Shorty, Out of Sight, Hombre, Mr. Majestyk, and Rum Punch (adapted for the movie Jackie Brown). Leonard's writings include short stories that became the films 3:10 to Yuma and The Tall T, as well as the current FX television series Justified.\n\nNovels:\n1 The Bounty Hunters\n2 The Law at Randado\n3 Escape from Five Shadows\n4 Last Stand at Saber River\n5 Hombre\n6 The Big Bounce\n7 The Moonshine War\n8 Valdez Is Coming\n9 Forty Lashes Less One\n10 Mr Majestyk\n11 52 Pickup\n12 Swag (aka Ryan's Rules)\n13 Unknown Man No 89\n14 The Hunted\n15 The Switch\n16 Gunsights\n17 City Primeval\n18 Gold Coast\n19 Split Images\n20 Cat Chaser\n21 Stick\n22 La Brava\n23 Glitz\n24 Bandits\n25 Touch\n26 Freaky Deaky\n27 Killshot\n28 Get Shorty\n29 Maximum Bob\n30 Rum Punch (aka Jackie Brown)\n31 Pronto\n32 Riding the Rap\n33 Out of Sight\n34 Naked Came the Manatee\n35 Cuba Libre\n36 Be Cool\n37 Pagan Babies\n38 Fire in the Hole\n39 When the Women Come Out to Dance\n40 Tishomingo blues\n41 A Coyote's in the House\n42 Mr Paradise\n43 The Hot Kid\n44 Comfort to the Enemy &amp; Other Carl Webster Stories\n45 Up in Honey's Room\n46 Road Dogs\n47 Djibouti\n48 Raylan\n\nShort Stories and Collections:\n3:10 to Yuma and Other Stories\nBlood Money and Other Stories\nHow Carlos Webster Changed His Name to Carl and Became a Famous Oklahoma Lawman\nKaren Makes Out\nLouly and Pretty Boy\nMoment of Vengeance and Other Stories\nThe Complete Western Stories of Elmore Leonard\n\nNonfiction:\n10 Rules Of Writing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f9d4167ea2bab4a79795007fc33619b33dc96fd","amp;dn":"Elmore+Leonard+Novels+%26amp%3B+Short+Stories+%2856+Books%29%28Crime%2C+Susp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f9d4167ea2bab4a79795007fc33619b33dc96fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,157,65,103,234,43,171,74,121,121,80,7,252,51,97,155,51,220,150,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
