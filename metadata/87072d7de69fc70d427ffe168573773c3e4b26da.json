Matt Cameron became the band's permanent drummer in\n1986 while bassist Ben Shepherd became a permanent replacement for Yamamoto in 1990.Soundgarden was one of the key\nbands in the creation of grunge, a style of alternative rock that developed in Seattle and was based around the band's record label Sub Pop. Soundgarden was the first grunge band to sign to a major label, though the band did not achieve commercial success until Seattle contemporaries Nirvana and Pearl Jam popularized grunge in the early 1990s.Soundgarden achieved its biggest success with the 1994 album, Superunknown, which debuted at number one on the Billboard charts and yielded the Grammy AwardÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning singles &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; and &quot;Spoonman&quot;. In 1997, the band broke up due to internal strife over its creative direction. Soundgarden has sold eight million records in the U.S.,and an estimated twenty million worldwide.\n\nMembers :\n\nChris Cornell\nKim Thayil\nMatt Cameron\nBen Shepherd\n\n\n\nTrack list :\n\n'Superunknown' 1994\n\n1. &quot;Let Me Drown&quot;\n2. &quot;My Wave&quot;    \n3. &quot;Fell on Black Days&quot;    \n4. &quot;Mailman&quot;    \n5. &quot;Superunknown&quot;    \n6. &quot;Head Down&quot;    \n7. &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot;    \n8. &quot;Spoonman&quot;    \n9. &quot;Limo Wreck&quot;      \n10. &quot;The Day I Tried to Live&quot;    \n11. &quot;Kickstand&quot;    \n12. &quot;Fresh Tendrils&quot;  \n13. &quot;4th of July&quot;    \n14. &quot;Half&quot;  \n15. &quot;Like Suicide&quot;  \nAnd then you have two more CDs \n'Superunknown' is the fourth studio album by the American alternative rock band Soundgarden, released on March 8,\n1994 through A&amp;M Records.
