You really get a chance to hear some nice touches you can't hear on the album, esp. harmony-wise. A very pleasant surprise. Well produced too.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. The lovers are losing\n2. Everybody's changing\n3. Your love\n4. This is the last time\n5. Clear skies\n6. Bend and break\n7. Nothing in my way\n8. Shadow\n9. Spiralling\n10. A bad dream\n11. Perfect Symmetry\n12. Looking back (feat K'naan)\n13. Somewhere only we know\n14. Stop for a minute (feat K'naan)\n15. Is it any wonder\n16. Crystal ball\n17. Bedshaped \n\nI'm not sure it's entirely official, but doesn't mean I can't share it :)\n\nSeed and enjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d99027f04235bdcc6f6579b920f45b04978cf8f0","amp;dn":"Keane+-+Greatest+Hits+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d99027f04235bdcc6f6579b920f45b04978cf8f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,144,39,240,66,53,189,204,111,101,121,185,32,244,91,4,151,140,248,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
