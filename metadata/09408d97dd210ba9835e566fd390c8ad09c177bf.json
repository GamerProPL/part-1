It also named HEVC which stands for High-Efficient Video Codec.\nif you want to play this smoothly, you need to use a device/PC with at least dual-core processor. \nYou have to update your player to latest version. Also if you use your PC to watch it, installing LAV Filter will help you a lot if you want to use KMPlayer or PotPlayer. Many players have native support for the codec, live MPC-HC(free) or PowerDVD 14(paid).\nAnyway, there's a video samples so you can download, check the quality and check if you can play it or not. it's very easy though. believe me, this format will be so popular in one or two years so you have to deal with it anyway. \n\nIf you ever download this, let me know about the results of your satisfaction. If it will be sucsessful, I will do other TV-shows in this format.\n\nThis release DOES have best English Subtitle I could find and it DOES NOT have commentary tracks.\n\nI don't see any more info needed here. just check the sample, if you like it, download the rest and enjoy. I watched the whole series before I release it to be assured there's nothing wrong with it. you can't find any other release of the series with this quality in this size range. \n\nI wish I could have included some extra,gag reel, etc. but I couldn't find any good source for it. if you know a good source for these stuff, tell me and I will post them in a different release.\n\nDownload LAV Filters: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters/releases&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters/releases&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMPC-HC: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mpc-hc.org/downloads/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mpc-hc.org/downloads/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVideo\nFormat                                   : HEVC\nFormat/Info                              : High Efficiency Video Coding\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;c18ca0a8af818df2eff0&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz / 24.0 KHz\nTitle                                    : Stereo\nLanguage                                 : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09408d97dd210ba9835e566fd390c8ad09c177bf","amp;dn":"Friends.Complete.Series.S01-S10.720p.BluRay.2CH.x265.HEVC-PSA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09408d97dd210ba9835e566fd390c8ad09c177bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,64,141,151,221,33,11,169,131,94,86,111,211,144,200,173,9,193,119,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
