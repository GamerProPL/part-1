It is more concise and easier to read than some, yet it covers the breadth of emergency medicine practice more comprehensively than others. The bottom line is that I like this book. Just as previous editions did, the seventh presents all of the most pertinent and up-to-date information in a well-organized format that is comprehensive yet easy to read. That and many of the attractive new features in this current edition will ensure its place on my bookshelf for years to come.&quot;--JAMA\n\nWith 418 contributors representing over 120 medical centers around the world, TintinalliÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Emergency Medicine is the most practical and clinically rigorous reference of its kind.
