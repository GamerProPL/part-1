Hitler, who loathed flying, felt safe with Baur and would allow no one else to pilot him. As a result, an intimate relationship developed between the two men and it is this, which gives these memoirs special significance. Hitler relaxed in Baurâ€™s company and talked freely of his plans and of his real opinions about his friends and allies. \r\n\r\nBaur was also present during some of the most salient moments of the Third Reich; the RÃ¶hm Putsch, the advent of Eva Braun, Ribbentropâ€™s journey to Moscow, the BÃ¼rgerbrÃ¤ukeller attempt on Hitlerâ€™s life; and when war came, he flew Hitler from front to front. He remained in Hitler's service right up to the final days in the FÃ¼hrerbunker. In a powerful account of Hitlerâ€™s last hours, Baur describes his final discussions with Hitler before his apparent suicide; and his last meeting with Magda Goebbels in the tortuous moments before she killed her three children. Remarkably, throughout it all Baurâ€™s loyalty to the FÃ¼hrer never wavered. His memoirs capture these events in all their fascinating and disturbing detail","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0a6a9b2e22f0bf57f6e79dd2d07f7d7a7a9eef7","amp;dn":"I+Was+Hitler%27s+Pilot%3A+The+Memoirs+of+Hans+Baur","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0a6a9b2e22f0bf57f6e79dd2d07f7d7a7a9eef7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,166,169,178,226,47,11,245,127,110,121,221,45,7,247,215,167,169,238,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
