Darth Malak , last surviving apprentice of the Dark Lord Revan, has unleashed an invincible Sith armada upon an unsuspecting galaxy.\n\nCrushing all resistance, MalakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s war of conquest has left the Jedi Order scattered and vulnerable as countless Knights fall in battle, and many more swear allegiance to the new Sith Master.

You are the last hope of the Jedi Order. Can you master the awesome power of the ForceÃ¢â€žÂ¢ on your quest to save the Republic? Or will you fall to the lure of the dark side? Hero or villain, savior or conqueror... you alone will determine the destiny of the entire galaxy!\n\n\n* Learn to use the Force with over 40 different powers and build your own lightsaber.\n\n* Adventure through some of the most popular STAR WARSÃ¢â€žÂ¢ locations, including Tatooine and the Wookiee homeworld Kashyyyk.\n\n* Travel to eight enormous worlds in your own starship, the Ebon Hawk.\n\n* Choose your party from nine customisable characters, including Twi'leks, DroidsÃ¢â€žÂ¢ and Wookiees.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_knights_of_the_old_republic&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_knights_of_the_old_republic&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27bd600b3a16c70bef305d5ebcd1fb51205b160a","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Knight+Of+The+Old+Republic+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27bd600b3a16c70bef305d5ebcd1fb51205b160a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,189,96,11,58,22,199,11,239,48,93,94,188,209,251,81,32,91,22,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
