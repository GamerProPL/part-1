Born September 26, 1945, in Washington, England, Ferry, the son of a coal miner, began his musical career as a singer with the rock outfit the Banshees while studying art at the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne under pop conceptualist Richard Hamilton. He later joined the Gas Board, a soul group featuring bassist Graham Simpson; in 1970, Ferry and Simpson formed Roxy Music. \n\nEvolving from the late-'60s art-rock movement, Roxy Music had a fascination with fashion, glamour, cinema, pop art, and the avant-garde, which separated the band from their contemporaries. Dressed in bizarre, stylish costumes, the group played a defiantly experimental variation of art rock which vacillated between avant-rock and sleek pop hooks. During the early '70s, the group was driven by the creative tension between Bryan Ferry and Brian Eno, who each pulled the band in separate directions: Ferry had a fondness for American soul and Beatlesque art-pop, while Eno was intrigued by deconstructing rock with amateurish experimentalism inspired by the Velvet Underground. This incarnation of Roxy Music may have only recorded two albums, but it inspired a legion of imitators -- not only the glam-rockers of the early '70s, but art-rockers and new wave pop groups of the late '70s. Following Eno's departure, Roxy Music continued with its arty inclinations for a few albums before gradually working in elements of disco and soul. Within a few years, the group had developed a sophisticated, seductive soul-pop that relied on Ferry's stylish crooning. By the early '80s, the group had developed into a vehicle for Ferry, so it was no surprise that he disbanded the group at the height of its commercial success in the early '80s to pursue a solo career. \n\n\nenre................: Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Virgin\nIncluded.............: Covers, Log, Cue\n\n\nCD1\n\n01 - Virginia Plain (Roxy Music)\n02 - Pyjamarama (Roxy Music)\n03 - Do The Strand (Roxy Music)\n04 - A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall (Bryan Ferry)\n05 - Street Life (Roxy Music)\n06 - All I Want Is You (Roxy Music)\n07 - The 'In' Crowd (Bryan Ferry)\n08 - Smoke Gets In Your Eyes (Bryan Ferry)\n09 - You Go To My Head (Bryan Ferry)\n10 - Love Is The Drug (Roxy Music)\n11 - Both Ends Burning (Roxy Music)\n12 - Let's Stick Together (Bryan Ferry)\n13 - The Price Of Love (Bryan Ferry)\n14 - This Is Tomorrow (Bryan Ferry)\n15 - Tokyo Joe (Bryan Ferry)\n\nCD2\n\n01 - Sign Of The Times (Bryan Ferry)\n02 - What Goes On (Bryan Ferry)\n03 - Carrickfergus (Bryan Ferry)\n04 - Trash (Roxy Music)\n05 - Dance Away (Roxy Music)\n06 - Angel Eyes (Roxy Music)\n07 - Over You (Roxy Music)\n08 - Oh Yeah!
