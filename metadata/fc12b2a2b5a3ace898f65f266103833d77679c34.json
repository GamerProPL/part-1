As their numbers mounted, he decided to learn the arts of orchestration and arrangement, even though he couldn't read or write music, taking inspiration from Arvo PÃƒÂ¤rt, Philip Glass, Henryk Gorecki, Edward Elgar, Ralph Vauhan Williams and Saint-SaÃƒÂ«ns. The result is a collection of songs from cello, woodwind and piano, which he describes as &quot;bedroom classical&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ since he recorded the whole thing in his bedroom Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with layers built using found objects and charity shop instruments.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc12b2a2b5a3ace898f65f266103833d77679c34","amp;dn":"Keaton+Henson+-+Romantic+Works+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc12b2a2b5a3ace898f65f266103833d77679c34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,18,178,162,181,163,172,232,152,246,95,38,97,3,131,61,119,103,156,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
