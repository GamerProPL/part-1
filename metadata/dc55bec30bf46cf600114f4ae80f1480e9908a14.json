These\nrabid creatures were easily provoked and resistant to\nconventional attack. Eight specimens were encountered in the\nregion now referred to as &quot;Ground:ALPHA&quot;... Only four were\nsuccessfully contained for study. Victims of the attack were\nquarantined at a research facility nearby. These victims\ndisplayed signs of internal liquefaction and accelerated\nnecrosis, similar to symptoms of other flesh-eating viruses\nnative to that region.\n\nBut it wasn't a viral outbreak. It was a parasitic\ninfestation. A previously unidentified species of hook worm\nwas found beneath the skin of the Ground: ALPHA specimens.\nThese parasites, we call them &quot;Alpha-worms&quot;, laid dozens of\neggs inside their hosts, which in turn produced numerous\nlarvae. These larvae penetrated the bloodstream and triggered\na variety of genetic failures. However, unlike most genetic\nfailures, these symptoms were not fatal. Instead, infested\nvictims were larger, stronger and driven by hunger. Using the\nresearch gained from the Ground: ALPHA specimens, a team of\nsome special individuals were assembled. Minor outbreaks\noccurred over the next few years, but elite squad quickly put\nthem down. Which brings us to the current situation in\nTokyo...\n\nExciting and challenging battles with 3 different weapons\n\nQTE and cinematic action\n\nVariety of powerful ninja abilities\n\nWeapon and ninjutsu upgrade system\n\nCrisscross the city of Tokyo with intense gunfights\n\nInstall Notes:\n\n1.
