The intimate narrative of his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, his years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-ridden city, his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a legendary school of magic, and his life as a fugitive after the murder of a king form a gripping coming-of-age story unrivaled in recent literature. A high-action story written with a poet's hand, The Name of the Wind is a masterpiece that will transport readers into the body and mind of a wizard.\n\n\n---\n\n\n The Wise Man's Fear (The Kingkiller Chronicle #2)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“There are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nMy name is Kvothe.\n\nI have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trehon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep.\n\nYou may have heard of me.\n\nSo begins the tale of a hero told from his own point of view Ã¢â‚¬â€ a story unequaled in fantasy literature. Now in The Wise Man's Fear, an escalating rivalry with a powerful member of the nobility forces Kvothe to leave the University and seek his fortune abroad. Adrift, penniless, and alone, he travels to Vintas, where he quickly becomes entangled in the politics of courtly society. While attempting to curry favor with a powerful noble, Kvothe uncovers an assassination attempt, comes into conflict with a rival arcanist, and leads a group of mercenaries into the wild, in an attempt to solve the mystery of who (or what) is waylaying travelers on the King's Road.\n\nAll the while, Kvothe searches for answers, attempting to uncover the truth about the mysterious Amyr, the Chandrian, and the death of his parents. Along the way, Kvothe is put Ã¯Â»Â¿on trial by the legendary Adem mercenaries, is forced to reclaim the honor of the Edema Ruh, and travels into the Fae realm. There he meets Felurian, the faerie woman no man can resist, and who no man has ever survived...until Kvothe.\n\nIn The Wise Man's Fear, Kvothe takes his first steps on the path of the hero and learns how difficult life can be when a man becomes a legend in his own time.\n\nRead by Podehl Nick\nFormat: MP3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c3b49ed29aac04b22f3dabe9de7e5231a62e419","amp;dn":"Rothfuss+Patrick+-+The+Kingkiller+Chronicles+%5B1-2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c3b49ed29aac04b22f3dabe9de7e5231a62e419","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,59,73,237,41,170,192,75,34,243,218,190,157,231,229,35,26,98,228,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
