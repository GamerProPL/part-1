During flow, people typically experience deep enjoyment, creativity, and a total involvement with life. In this new edition of his groundbreaking classic work, Csikszentmihalyi demonstrates the ways this positive state can be controlled, not just left to chance. Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience teaches how, by ordering the information that enters our consciousness, we can discover true happiness and greatly improve the quality of our lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1fe41e2d3798cc436df4e23e71b5ce1c513071d","amp;dn":"Flow+the+Psychology+of+Optimal+Experience+-+Mihaly+Csikszentmiha","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1fe41e2d3798cc436df4e23e71b5ce1c513071d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,254,65,226,211,121,140,196,54,223,78,35,231,27,92,225,197,19,7,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
