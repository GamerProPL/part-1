Landis, Ming-Ho Yu (CRC, 2004).pdf\r\n\r\nThe rapidly evolving field of environmental toxicology involves the study of toxic compounds and their effect on living organisms, as well as their fate within the natural environment. Since publication of the first edition, Introduction to Environmental Toxicology has found a secure place among the major texts and references in this field. \r\n\r\nIntroduction to Environmental Toxicology, Third Edition seamlessly covers processes and impacts from the molecular level all the way up to population levels. While retaining the strengths of previous editions, the third edition includes a new chapter on fluoride, an update on endocrine disruption, a discussion of the use of models to reconstruct concentration-response curves, expansion of the metals chapter, and new developments in ecological risk assessment for management decisions at site to regional scales. It is an ideal text for introducing students to the fields of ecotoxicology and risk assessment","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0588fdbe017168b18e23edf57ecbe6c72663fb8c","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Environmental+Toxicology+-+Impacts+of+Chemicals+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0588fdbe017168b18e23edf57ecbe6c72663fb8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,136,253,190,1,113,104,177,142,35,237,245,126,203,230,199,38,99,251,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
