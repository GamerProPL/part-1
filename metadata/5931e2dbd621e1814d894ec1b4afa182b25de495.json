Use the menu on the left to find out more       \n  details about its concepts, but most importantly, download the free demo and  \n  see for yourself.                                                             \n                                                                                \n    Despite its complexity, Dune is easy to use. This is because it is          \n  conceptually a subtractive synth, hence it will be familiar to many musicians \n  who are used to work with (virtual-)analog gear.                              \n                                                                                \n    As you can see on the screenshot, it uses the familiar Oscillator, LFO and  \n  ADSR envelope sections on the surface, known from many synthesizers. All      \n  knobs can be remote-controlled via MIDI for hands-on access.                  \n                                                                    \n\n 1.Uninstall previous versions.                              \n 2.Unrar and install.                      \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5931e2dbd621e1814d894ec1b4afa182b25de495","amp;dn":"Synapse.Audio.DUNE.VSTi.v1.4.0.x86.x64+by+CHRISJEPIEK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5931e2dbd621e1814d894ec1b4afa182b25de495","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,49,226,219,214,33,225,129,77,137,78,193,180,175,161,130,178,93,228,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
