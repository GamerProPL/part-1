One of GOG's (Good Old Games) policies is to avoid using any kind of DRM in the games they sell, meaning that you don't have to download a crack or use a serial key. It comes with a launcher that will automatically patch your game to the latest version. Note that this version includes all available languages (English, French, German, Polish and Russian).\n\nIn comparison with my previous The Witcher 2 torrent, this one features not only the most recent version of the game, it also includes all extras, the REDkit modding tool, and a couple of mods that I think enhance the gameplay in various ways.\n\nIf you enjoyed the game, you can support the developers by buying it legally. :-) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70acabb986a01770c9cb8fff1a5faab695af327c","amp;dn":"The+Witcher+2+-+Enhanced+Edition+%28DRM+free%2FGOG.com%29+%28incl.+all+e","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70acabb986a01770c9cb8fff1a5faab695af327c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,172,171,185,134,160,23,112,201,203,143,255,26,95,170,182,149,175,50,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
