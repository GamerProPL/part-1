You either like the tracks or you don't, and you can read 'em before you buy. There's no complaint about the quality of this recording--it's the first &quot;best of-&quot; collection I ever bought that I did not return because of lousy recording. There was no need to adjust volume or tone setting for different tracks as I have found to be the case on some other collections. The music was clear, and &quot;punchy&quot; not flat as vinyl recordings sometimes sounded when the recording engineers used to compress the dynamic range so they could fit more music on a disc--a trend that seems for no reason to have been carried over into the digital recording media by some companies.\n\nThis one was very well done, as I expected--it's from Sony.\n\nI also got &quot;70's Pop Hits [BOX SET]&quot; (Sony), a three CD set, also very well done, with maybe a half-dozen duplications of tracks on &quot;Greatest Hits of the 70's [BOX SET].&quot; The &quot;Pop Hits&quot; set did have one track that was in mono, which wasn't so much a disappointment as it was just plain odd, considering how good the rest of it sounded.\n\nI give them both five stars for the price and quality of recording.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2b70562f2d5c00fd0d441609b72911cc6ee38ef","amp;dn":"Greatest+Hits+of+the+Seventies+3CD+Set+320cbr+Classic+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2b70562f2d5c00fd0d441609b72911cc6ee38ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,183,5,98,242,213,192,15,208,212,65,96,155,114,145,28,198,238,56,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
