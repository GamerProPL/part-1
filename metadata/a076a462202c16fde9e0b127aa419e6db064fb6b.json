Numerous studies have revealed that in every country, native-speakers use only about 2,500 distinct words and phrases on a daily basis. Dr. Pimsleur spent his lifetime studying these language building blocks. With the Pimsleur approach, it's not how many words you know, but rather, which words you can use. By aiming each lesson at teaching you to use those 2500 words, the Pimsleur approach teaches you to speak the most French in the least amount of time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a076a462202c16fde9e0b127aa419e6db064fb6b","amp;dn":"Learn+French+%28Pimsleur%29+%284+Audio+CDs+-+MP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a076a462202c16fde9e0b127aa419e6db064fb6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,118,164,98,32,44,22,253,233,224,177,39,170,65,158,109,176,100,251,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
