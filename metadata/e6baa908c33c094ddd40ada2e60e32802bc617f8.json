This\r\nintroductory workshop from David Powers is designed to\r\nchange that by teaching you PHP through a series of clear\r\nfocused, easy-to-follow lessons. After briefly explaining\r\nwhat PHP is and how it integrates with HTML, David\r\nintroduces the features of the language. He covers\r\nvariables, conditional statements, calculations, loops, and\r\nfunctions, as well as server-side includes and error\r\nhanding, in a series of hands-on exercises. He then moves\r\nto a larger project that involves building a script to\r\nvalidate and email user input from an online form. By\r\nfollowing along, you'll come to understand the value of\r\ncreating reusable code, the importance of PHP security, and\r\nhow to deal with multiple-choice form fields\r\n\r\nTopics include:\r\n\r\n* Naming variables\r\n\r\n* Storing text as strings\r\n\r\n* Doing calculations with PHP\r\n\r\n* Using conditional statements to make decisions\r\n\r\n* Creating custom functions\r\n\r\n* Deciphering error messages\r\n\r\n* Emailing the contents of an online form\r\n\r\n* Dealing with multiple-choice form fields","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6baa908c33c094ddd40ada2e60e32802bc617f8","amp;dn":"Lynda+Introducing+PHP+Tutorial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6baa908c33c094ddd40ada2e60e32802bc617f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,186,169,8,195,60,9,77,221,64,173,162,230,14,50,128,43,198,23,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
