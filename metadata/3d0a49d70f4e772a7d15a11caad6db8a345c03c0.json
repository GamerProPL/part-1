The Blues Brothers \nsoundtrack was released on Atlantic Records. On the surface this doesn't \nseem unusual, since the Blues Brothers' Atlantic debut, Briefcase Full of \nBlues, was a number one album; but the movie was released by Universal, \nand its parent company, MCA, passed on the soundtrack. The rollicking \nremake of the Spencer Davis Group's &quot;Gimme Some Lovin'&quot; was a hit, \nfeaturing an arrangement notable for the horn section that replaces Steve \nWinwood's rumbling organ work. Ray Charles has a good time with &quot;Shake a \nTail Feather,&quot; and he's helped out by Jake and Elwood Blues (Belushi and \nAykroyd, respectively). The cover of Solomon Burke's &quot;Everybody Needs \nSomebody to Love&quot; is a lot of fun, thanks to the great overall rhythm and \nElwood's lightning-fast stage rap, while James Brown and the Reverend \nJames Cleveland Choir provide a blast of gospel music on &quot;Old Landmark.&quot; \nAretha Franklin's &quot;Think&quot; is explosive, and Cab Calloway's &quot;Minnie the \nMoocher&quot; is slyly irresistible. Charles, Brown, Franklin, and Calloway all have \nsmall roles in the film, yet so does John Lee Hooker, but he's not represented \nhere.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d0a49d70f4e772a7d15a11caad6db8a345c03c0","amp;dn":"The+Blues+Brothers+OST++%5BRemastered%5D+V2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d0a49d70f4e772a7d15a11caad6db8a345c03c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,10,73,215,15,78,119,42,125,21,161,28,170,214,219,138,52,92,3,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
