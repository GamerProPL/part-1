All too often, our natural talents go untapped. From the cradle to the cubicle, we devote more time to fixing our shortcomings than to developing our strengths. \n\nTo help people uncover their talents, Gallup introduced the first version of its online assessment, StrengthsFinder, in 2001 which ignited a global conversation and helped millions to discover their top five talents. \n\nIn its latest national bestseller, StrengthsFinder 2.0, Gallup unveils the new and improved version of its popular assessment, language of 34 themes, and much more (see below for details). While you can read this book in one sitting, you'll use it as a reference for decades. \n\nLoaded with hundreds of strategies for applying your strengths, this new book and accompanying website will change the way you look at yourself--and the world around you--forever. \n\nAvailable exclusively in StrengthsFinder 2.0:\n(using the unique access code included with each book) \n\n* A new and upgraded edition of the StrengthsFinder assessment \n* A personalized Strengths Discovery and Action-Planning Guide for applying your strengths in the next week, month, and year \n* A more customized version of your top five theme report \n* 50 Ideas for Action (10 strategies for building on each of your top five themes) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5104e889e50f80e3acd80bf916b41b230f007e1b","amp;dn":"StrengthsFinder+2.0+-Tom+Rath+%5BQwerty80%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5104e889e50f80e3acd80bf916b41b230f007e1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,4,232,137,229,15,128,227,172,216,11,249,22,180,27,35,15,0,126,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
