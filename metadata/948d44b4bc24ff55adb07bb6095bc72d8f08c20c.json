Use your favorite burning program to create your disc. If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have one, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d recommend ImgBurn as simple and easy to use.\n\nIf you want the files on your computer and arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sure how to get them there without burning the DVD first, look up Daemon tools. This can be used to mount the iso file as a virtual drive on your computer, from which you can rip and convert as normal. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:948d44b4bc24ff55adb07bb6095bc72d8f08c20c","amp;dn":"Insanity+disc+4+Cardio+Recovery+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"948d44b4bc24ff55adb07bb6095bc72d8f08c20c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,141,68,180,188,36,255,85,173,176,123,182,9,91,199,45,143,8,194,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
