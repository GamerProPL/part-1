Ezio Auditore di Firenze is yet another ancestor of modern day Desmond Miles - a nobleman out to avenge the death of his family in the guise of a shadowy assassin.\n\nLike the last game you're given total freedom to explore multiple cities, but with greatly improved parkour skills and the new ability to swim. There's also a lot more variety in the missions you undertake - the main complaint with the original game- so you'll never feel you're just doing the same tasks over and over again.\n\nCombat has also been completely overhauled, with dozens of different weapons and a new health system. With no less than Leonardo da Vinci acting as your very own Q style gadget master this stunning sequel improves on every element of the original.\n\n    Key Features\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Renaissance man: Play as an all-new character in 15th century Italy, with new abilities, new weapons and a whole new world to explore.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The spice of life: Massively improved mission variety, with new freeform mission structures and many more random events.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Tools of the trade: All-new combat system lets you steal weapons from your opponents, use dual hidden blades and even an early form of pistol.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Real history: Meet historical figures such as Leonardo da Vinci, NiccolÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â² Machiavelli and Lorenzo de' Medici, all of whom can offer you their own unique brand of aid.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Tourist spots: Explore real world locations including Rome, Venice, Florence and Tuscany, as well as specific landmarks such as the Grand Canal and St Mark's Basilica.\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nMinimum Configuration:\nSUPPORTED OS: Mac OS X 10.5 / Mac OS X 10.6\nProcessor: Intel CoreÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 2 Duo 1.8 GHZ\nRAM: 2 GB \nVideo Card: 256 MB OpenGL 2.1 compliant card with Shader Model 3.0 or higher (see supported list)\nDVD-ROM: DVD-ROM dual-layer drive\nHard Drive Space: 9.5 GB\nPeripherals Supported: Keyboard, mouse\n\n* This product does not support OS prior to Mac OS X 10.5\n* This product does not support Macs based on PowerPC CPU","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d141af6123bdb936fb461b2270fdf686cda33270","amp;dn":"Assassin%5C%27s+Creed+II+%5BMac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d141af6123bdb936fb461b2270fdf686cda33270","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,65,175,97,35,189,185,54,251,70,27,34,112,253,246,134,205,163,50,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
