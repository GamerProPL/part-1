Command your troops through an epic (mis)adventure as you defend exotic lands from dragons, man-eating plants, and ghastly denizens of the underworld -all with flashy new towers, levels, heroes, and more goodies to help you crush your foes to a pulp. (Don't worry, we've still got all the good ol' stuff from the last game, too. It's vintage now.)\r\n\r\nKingdom Rush: Frontiers packs in so much content, it's like a fully upgraded artillery blast of mouthwatering, pixelated joy launched right into your smiling little face... and it hurts so good!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:525b3af68376ed0fe92a19fd70ba3928284ced79","amp;dn":"Kingdom+Rush+Frontiers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"525b3af68376ed0fe92a19fd70ba3928284ced79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,91,58,246,131,118,237,15,233,42,25,253,112,186,57,40,40,76,237,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
