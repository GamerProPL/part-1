It is formed by a series of loosely connected episodes. The plot is minimal, and the only character to develop significantly is Rome herself. Peter Gonzales plays the young Fellini, and the film features mainly unknowns in the cast, but includes uncredited guest appearances by Anna Magnani, Marcello Mastroianni, Feodor Chaliapin, Jr., Alberto Sordi, Gore Vidal, John Francis Lane, Elliott Murphy and Fellini himself. The appearances by Marcello Mastroianni and Alberto Sordi were deleted in the later copies of the film and in VHS and DVD editions. The film was screened at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival, but wasn't entered into the main competition.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Roma.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.61 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 53mn\n      Overall bit rate : 2 030 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 53mn\n      Bit rate : 1 828 Kbps\n      Width : 704 pixels\n      Height : 416 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.692\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.250\n      Stream size : 1.45 GiB (90%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 53mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 156 MiB (9%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069191/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069191/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nItalian audio; English, French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted originally at KG by 54, whom we thank\n\nFederico Fellini - Roma (1972)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d6dac6a96d528121fa5dfa6e3c25803842eef0c","amp;dn":"Federico+Fellini+-+Roma+%281972%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d6dac6a96d528121fa5dfa6e3c25803842eef0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,109,172,106,150,213,40,18,31,165,223,166,227,194,88,3,132,46,239,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
