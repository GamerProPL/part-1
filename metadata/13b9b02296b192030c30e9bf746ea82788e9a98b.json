It is an updated version of Street Fighter IV and has been said to mark the definitive end of the Street Fighter IV series.[3] Having been deemed as too large an update to be deployed as DLC, the game was made into a standalone title, but given a lower price than that of a full retail game.[4] It was released on April 27, 2010 in North America, April 28, 2010 in Japan, and April 30, 2010 in Europe for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[5] Super Street Fighter IV was released as one of the launch titles for the Nintendo 3DS, with 3D functionality, on February 26, 2011 in Japan.[6] As of March 2011, the game has sold 1.6 million units worldwide,[7] while Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition has shipped an additional 1 million copies as of April 2011.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13b9b02296b192030c30e9bf746ea82788e9a98b","amp;dn":"Super+Street+Fighter+IV+Arcade+Edition+PC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13b9b02296b192030c30e9bf746ea82788e9a98b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,185,176,34,150,177,146,3,12,48,233,191,116,110,168,39,136,233,169,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
