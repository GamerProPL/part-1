The developers decided to use the experience gained in\nBlack Isle Studios and create a role-playing game combining the best\nfeatures of the genre classics such as Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale,\nPlanescape Torment, and Fallout. Among the developers are Tim Cain\n(Fallout, Arcanum, Temple of Elemental Evil), Josh Sawyer (Icewind Dale\nand Icewind Dale II, Fallout: New Vegas), Scott Everts (Fallout,\nPlanescape: Torment, Icewind Dale, Icewind Dale II, Fallout: New Vegas),\nBrian Menze (Planescape: Torment), and Dan Spitzley (Planescape: Torment).\nThe plot of Project Eternity is set in a vast fantasy world. The players\ncan visit a number of realms, including Ruins of Eir Glanfath, Free\nPalatinate of Dyrwood, Pearl Coast, and Lake of the Drow Tombs. The\nvarious locations are characterized by considerable diversity, including\ndifferent kinds of opponents. While traveling, the main character faces\nmany NPCs, some of which may give him a quest or, in some cases, join his\nparty.\n\nPillars of Eternity: The White March - Part Iis a large sprawling\nexpansion pack with hours of gameplay integrated into the main\nadventure. Along with the new quests and area content, the team at\nObsidian continues to support and make improvements to the entire\ngame, including the additions of Player Party AI and Enhanced Enemy\nAI.
