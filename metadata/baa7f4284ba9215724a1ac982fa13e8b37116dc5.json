In and around this church, Anders Thomas Jensens unleashes an outright war of good and evil in a story full of black humor that leaves the viewer little choice but to laugh tears. Ole Thestrup as the local doctor beats everybody and everything in terms of comic morbidity.\n\nAnd yet behind all comedy, Adams ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â bler discusses much more serious issues. Is not Ivan&amp;#039;s naive (in danish the perfect anagram: naiv Ivan) denial of evil more dangerous and irresponsible than Adam&amp;#039;s evil, but realistic attitude? While Ivan suggests as Adam&amp;#039;s project to bake an apple pie, Adam is set out to break Ivans faith in God. The audience is seriously in doubt as to which project will be accomplished and what comes after that. In the pursuit of both projects, Ivan and Adam change places and take responsibility in very surprising and strange ways. This story is told with perfect timing and moving gravity realised by great actors.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baa7f4284ba9215724a1ac982fa13e8b37116dc5","amp;dn":"Adams+Aebler+%2F+Adam%5C%27s+Apples+%5BEnglish+subs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baa7f4284ba9215724a1ac982fa13e8b37116dc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,167,244,40,75,169,33,87,36,161,172,152,47,161,62,139,55,17,109,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
