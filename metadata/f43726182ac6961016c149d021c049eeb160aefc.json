This includes a detailed examination of Cisco Nexus switches and Cisco MDS storage products.\n\nRecommended skills:\nFamiliarity with the Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS)\n\nRecommended equipment:\nWhile no specific equipment is required to enjoy the course, practice Nexus and MDS devices would benefit the student.\n\nRelated certifications: Cisco CCNP Data Center, Cisco CCIE Data Center\n\n\nFrom the smallest organizations to the very largest, Cisco Data Center inventions are joining standards-based technologies to revolutionize the Information Technology (IT) industry. This course is critical for any engineer or designer that is interested in the future of network computing. Specifically, this course focuses on the Nexus and MDS equipment from Cisco Systems, and the technologies that make a unified fabric of LAN and SAN traffic possible. Some of the industry-hottest technologies are thoroughly explored including OTV, vPC, LISP, VM-FEX, and Cisco FabricPath (TRILL). This course is a perfect follow up from the CCNA Data Center courses here at CBT Nuggets, as well as the Cisco UCS courses.\n\n\nContent:\n01 - Intro\n02 - Overview and Data Center Architectures\n03 - The Nexus 7K Product Family\n04 - PRACTICAL: Exploring the 7K\n05 - Other Nexus Devices\n06 - Introducing the NX-OS\n07 - PRACTICAL: Initial Setup of the 5K\n08 - IOS In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU)\n09 - System Level High Availability\n10 - Virtual Device Contexts\n11 - Virtual Device Context Configuration\n12 - Basic Interface Parameters\n13 - Configuring FEX\n14 - Adapter FEX\n15 - VLANs, VXLANS, and Private VLANs\n16 - RSTP, MSTP, and STP Extensions\n17 - Port Channels and Virtual Port Channels\n18 - Configuring Port Channels and vPCs\n19 - Port Channels and FEX\n20 - PRACTICAL: FEX, PCs and vPCs\n21 - Cisco FabricPath\n22 - Configuring FabricPath\n23 - PRACTICAL: FabricPath\n24 - Routing Protocol Configurations\n25 - Graceful Restart\n26 - FHRPs\n27 - Policy Based Routing (PBR)\n28 - Multicast\n29 - Overlay Transport Virtualization (OTV)\n30 - Locator-ID Separation Protocol (LISP)\n31 - Nexus Security Features\n32 - Fibre Channel (FC)\n33 - Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE)\n34 - Data Center Bridging (DCB) Enhancements\n35 - Configuring SAN Technologies\n36 - PRACTICAL: Initial Setup of the MDS\n37 - User Management\n38 - Virtualization and the Unified Fabric\n39 - Cisco Fabric Services","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f43726182ac6961016c149d021c049eeb160aefc","amp;dn":"CBT+Nuggets+-+CCNP+Data+Center+DCUFI+642-997","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f43726182ac6961016c149d021c049eeb160aefc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,55,38,24,42,198,150,16,22,193,73,208,33,192,73,238,177,96,174,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
