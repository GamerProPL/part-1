Komodo 9 is approximately +50 elo stronger than Komodo 8 on one core according to the independent IPON test as well as our own internal testing, with the gain increasing with more cores, to about 60 elo on 4 cores based on our own tests.\n\nKey features of Komodo 9:\n\n - Evaluation developed by a Grandmaster\n\n - Multi-core support (up to 64 cores)\n\n - Syzygy endgame tablebase support\n\nWhat's new in Komodo 9:\n\n - Evaluation improvements\n\n   - better assessment of mobility/activity\n\n   - improved handling of drawish positions\n\n   - improved understanding of attacks on the king\n\n - Improved search performance (much better time-to-depth)\n\n - Chess 960 (Fischer Random Chess) support\n\n - Persistent Hash: save and restore analysis\n\n - Over 100 other improvements throughout the software\n\n===================\n\nIf you have Windows\n\n===================\n\nThe executables for Windows are in the /Windows subdirectory.  You will find two versions:\n\n  komodo-9-64bit.exe\n\n  komodo-9-32bit.exe\n\nWe recommend using the 64-bit version as long as your version of Windows supports it.\n\n=================\n\nIf you have Linux\n\n=================\n\nThe binaries for Linux are in the /Linux subdirectory. You will find two versions:\n\n  komodo-9-linux : This version is optimized for present day (2105) machines\n\n  komodo-9-linux-generic : Use this version if komodo-9-linux does not work\n\nNote that komodo-9-linux-generic computes the same moves but is slower. Both versions are 64-bit.\n\nThe program must have execute permissions to run. You can set these permissions with this command:\n\n$ chmod +x komodo-9-linux*\n\n====================\n\nIf you have Mac OS X\n\n====================\n\nThe binary for Mac OS X is in the /OSX subdirectory.\n\n  komodo-9-64-osx\n\nThe file must have execute permissions to run. If you have trouble getting your chess GUI to load Komodo 9, you can try setting these permissions from the Terminal.app with this command (run from the same directory as the Komodo OS X executable):\n\n$ chmod +x komodo-9-64-osx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:615302a09e322ed9ad80ff3aded4fa44d475b6a5","amp;dn":"Komodo+9+Chess+Engine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"615302a09e322ed9ad80ff3aded4fa44d475b6a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,83,2,160,158,50,46,217,173,128,255,58,222,212,250,68,212,117,182,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
