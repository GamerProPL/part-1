The Denver-based band had formed three years prior, when former schoolmates Isaac Slade (vocals, piano) and Joe King (guitar, vocals) unexpectedly bumped into each other at a local music store. The pair began a series of two-man jam sessions and soon expanded their lineup with two of Slade's former bandmates, drummer Ben Wysocki and guitarist David Welsh. Slade's younger brother, Caleb, also joined the band for a stint but was ultimately asked to leave; the resulting rift between the two siblings would later inspire the band's first hit single, &quot;Over My Head (Cable Car).&quot; After issuing the Movement EP in 2002, the quartet gained the support of Denver's KTCL radio station with a follow-up release, 2003's Reason EP. As the Fray's airplay increased alongside their local profile (Westworld, a Denver alt. weekly publication, deemed them &quot;Best New Band&quot; in 2004), they began attracting attention from Epic Records. The label ultimately signed the band in December 2004, and the Fray toured alongside Weezer and Ben Folds the following summer. \n\n+---------------+\n| Studio Albums |\n+---------------+\n\nHow To Save A Life\nThe Fray\nThe Fray (Deluxe Version)\n\n\n+-------------+\n| Live Albums |\n+-------------+\n\nAcoustic In Nashville - Bootleg No. 2 (Live) - EP\niTunes Live From SoHo - EP\nLive At The Electric Factory Bootleg No 1\n\n\n+---------------------+\n| Extended Plays - EP |\n+---------------------+\n\nChristmas - EP\nHeartless - EP\nMovement - EP\nOver My Head (Cable Car) - EP\nReason - EP\nThe Fray - EP\n\n\n+----------+\n| Settings |\n+----------+\n\nBit Rate: 320 kbps\nFormat: MPEG-1, Layer 3\n\n\n\n\nHow To Get Your Maximum Speed (uTorrent)\n\nTorrent Client - Preferences - Bandwidth - Number of connections - Set aprox. 500 for each \nTorrent Client - Preferences - BiTorrent - Protocol Encryption - Forced\nBandwidth Allocation - High (Set download/upload limit - Unlimited)\nStop Other Active Torrents - Start downloading and wait for connections.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01aec89cf6ee00ab752f37747bbe2a5c61558f0b","amp;dn":"The+Fray+Complete+Discography+%28CD+Quality%29+%5BtheLEAK%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01aec89cf6ee00ab752f37747bbe2a5c61558f0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,174,200,156,246,238,0,171,117,47,55,116,123,190,42,92,97,85,143,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
