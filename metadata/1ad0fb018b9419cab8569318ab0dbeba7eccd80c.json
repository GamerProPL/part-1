But Prism is still Prism! You can switch to Prism 6 with almost no learning curve, and can try the Prism 6 demo without removing Prism 5. Here are some of the highlights.\r\n\r\nNew Analyses â€“ ANOVA, multiple comparisons and more\r\n\r\nTwo-way ANOVA with repeated measures in both factors.\r\nMultiplicity adjusted (â€œexactâ€) P values for multiple comparison tests. Read more about this #1 request in our blog.\r\nNew post tests - Fisherâ€™s unprotected Least Significant Difference (LSD) and Holm-Sidak.\r\nRun a set of t tests (one per row) at once, correcting for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni or by contolling the False Discovery Rate (FDR).\r\nFollow two-way ANOVA with tests for simple or main effects. Don't worry if you don't know what that means - Prism 6 presents those choices graphically so the meaning is obvious.\r\nGreenhouse-Geisser correction in repeated measures one-way ANOVA to avoid the need to assume sphericity.\r\nGrubbsâ€™ outlier detection. Our most popular QuickCalc web calculator is now part of Prism.\r\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare two groups (an alternative to the Mann-Whitney test).\r\nRatio t test\r\nImproved curve fitting\r\n\r\nFit to implicit and differential models.\r\nWrite more complex models.\r\nQuicker interpolations. Prism 6 adds a new analysis that streamlines the process of interpolating values from standard curves.\r\nWeight your fit by 1/Y^k\r\nMonte-Carlo simulations without writing scripts.\r\nPie charts and more\r\n\r\n\r\nPrism 6 adds a new kind of data table for parts of whole data. Plot pie charts, donut plots and more.\r\nCompare the observed distribution of values with theoretically expected values with the chi-squared or binomial test.\r\nCompute each value as a fraction or percentage of the column total.\r\nWork with larger data sets\r\n\r\nEnter data in up to 256 data set columns.\r\nEnter up to 256 subcolumns per data set (up from 52 in Prism 5). This lets you compute repeated measures two-way ANOVA with more subjects.\r\n\r\nWork more efficiently\r\n\r\nFaster. Faster saving, faster closing, faster nonparametric calculations, faster graphing, faster, crisper screen redraws.\r\nFormat several data sets at once. Want to plot alternating columns as dotted lines? Now you can do it in one step.\r\nView and edit all of your column titles at once. Great for large files!\r\nChoose the size, shape and color of your data points right from the data table. You can even select any contiguous block of data and make choices for that specific subset of your data table.\r\nWAND. If you love MAGIC, you will love the new WAND. While MAGIC reformats graphs, the WAND analyzes and graphs a new data table to match what you have done to another.\r\nPaste link values from results tables into a data table so everything updates automatically. This also works if you want to link data from one data table to another","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ad0fb018b9419cab8569318ab0dbeba7eccd80c","amp;dn":"GraphPad+Prism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ad0fb018b9419cab8569318ab0dbeba7eccd80c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,208,251,1,139,148,25,202,184,86,147,24,171,13,190,186,126,204,216,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
