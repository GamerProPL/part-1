He\\&amp;#039;s going through a crisis, creative as well as personal-wise, that only gets worse after his second feature film. On one hand, he doesn\\&amp;#039;t seem to be able to end his relationship with Ana. On the other, the cinema that he dreams of seems to be further and further away. Besides, he receives disturbing news from someone he knows obsessed in finding the essence of the 7th art, as the shadow of heroine proves to be wider that expected.\nExperimental and disturbing, \\&quot;Arrebato\\&quot; (Rapture) was the cult movie for an entire generation. \n\nFinally, a decent remastered dvd came to light. I bought it and made a 1.34 GB avi/xvid/ac3 version of it, came out really nice. A gal nicknamed tah did the unthinkable: she patiently listened to the entire film and made subs for it! They\\&amp;#039;re in spanish, and not 100% in synch with this dvd version but starting tonite i\\&amp;#039;ll be on a 8 day graveyard shift which will give me, i hope, enough time to\na) synch them perfectly\nb) translate them to english (!)\nc) translate them to portuguese (!)\n\nThe movie is THAT good, yeah. \n\nArrebato.1979.Ivan.Zulueta.xvid.ac3.wickerman.avi\n1.410.054 KB\nXVID/AC3\n25 FPS\n192 kbs audio\n1554 kbps video\n720*400\n01:49:56 \n\n\nSpanish subs (not yet synched, wait for better ones!) at &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.com/en/subtitles/3286455/arrebato-es&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.com/en/subtitles/3286455/arrebato-es&lt;/a&gt; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0b0fc69a93315b2cd6989658d3d47804a143802","amp;dn":"Arrebato+%281979%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0b0fc69a93315b2cd6989658d3d47804a143802","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,176,252,105,169,51,21,178,205,105,137,101,141,61,71,128,74,20,56,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
