Its innovative pedagogical features, which encourage students to understand, apply, and synthesize content, reinforce the principles of general chemistry and provide the ideal platform for later studies.\n\nThe new tenth addition boasts a number of improvements, including expanded coverage of organic chemistry, as well as a consistent 3-part structure (Analyze Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Solve Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Assess) for every worked example. All of the student-favourite, pedagogically rich elements of this textbook have returned in the tenth edition with renewed focus, including 10 to 25 new questions per chapter and updated integrative examples that all follow the Practice Example A and Practice Example B format.\n\nAbout the Author\nRalph H. Petrucci\nRalph Petrucci received his B.S. in Chemistry from Union College, Schenectady, NY, and his Ph.D. from the University of WisconsinÃ¢â‚¬â€Madison. Following ten years of teaching, research, consulting, and directing the NSF Institutes for Secondary School Science Teachers at Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, Dr. Petrucci joined the planning staff of the new California State University campus at San Bernardino in 1964. There, in addition to his faculty appointment, he served as Chairman of the Natural Sciences Division and Dean of Academic Planning before retiring from teaching.\n\nF. Geoffrey Herring\nGeoff Herring received his B.Sc. and his Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry, both from the University of London. He is currently a Professor in the Department of Chemistry of the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. Dr. Herring has research interests in the area of biophysical chemistry and has published over 100 papers in the area of physical chemistry and chemical physics. Recently, Dr. Herring has undertaken studies in the use of information technology and interactive engagement methods in teaching general chemistry with a view to improving student comprehension and learning. Dr. Herring has taught chemistry from undergraduate to graduate levels for 30 years and has twice been the recipient of the Killam Prize for Excellence in Teaching.\n\nJeffry D. Madura\nJeffry D. Madura received his B.A. from Thiel College and his Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry from Purdue University. He is currently Professor and Chair in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry of Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, PA. Dr. MaduraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s research interests are in the area of computational chemistry and biophysical chemistry, and he has published over 70 papers in the area of physical chemistry and chemical physics. Recently, Dr. Madura has undertaken studies in the use of technology and interactive personal response systems in teaching general and physical chemistry with the goal of improving student comprehension and learning. Dr. Madura has taught chemistry from undergraduate to graduate levels for 15 years and has been the recipient of a Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award.\n\nCarey Bissonnette\nCarey Bissonnette received his B.Sc. in Chemistry from the University of Waterloo, Ontario and his Ph.D. in Theoretical Chemistry from the University of Camridge. He is currently Continuing Lecturer in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Waterloo. He has won awards for excellence in teaching, including the University of WaterlooÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Distinguished Teacher Award in 2005. Dr. Bissonnette has made extensive use of technology in both the classroom and the laboratory in order to create an interactive environment for his students to learn and explore. For the past several years, he has been actively engaged in undergraduate curriculum development, high school liaison activities, and the coordination of the UniversityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high school chemistry contests that are written each year by thousands of students around the world.\n--This text refers to an alternate Hardcover edition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22057324d176e8caab28cd779e0abdf58e0f5c65","amp;dn":"General+Chemistry+-+Principles+And+Modern+Applications+%2810th+Edi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22057324d176e8caab28cd779e0abdf58e0f5c65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,5,115,36,209,118,232,202,171,40,205,119,158,10,189,245,142,15,92,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
