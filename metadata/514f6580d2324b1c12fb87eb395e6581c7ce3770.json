Ultimate Echo Plug-In                                         \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n   When we designed EchoBoy, we were looking for an echo that was warmer  than \n   existing delay plug-ins,  yet not as  dark as guitar  pedal echos. Well  it \n   seems like  we got  this one  just right.  Since its  release, EchoBoy  has \n   quickly become  one of  those 'must-have'  plug-ins for  Pro Tools, and has \n   become a permanent fixture on the aux faders of hundreds of top mixers  and \n   engineers.                                                                  \n                                                                               \n   Vintage Tone                                                                \n                                                                               \n   Find an echo  tone that fits  your mix by  choosing one of  the 30 built-in \n   echo styles  modeled after  our personal  collection of  vintage echos. Our \n   favorite is  the warm  sound of  &quot;Studio Tape&quot;,  modeled after  our ATR-102 \n   half-inch two-track  machine. You'll  also get  instant access  to a  whole \n   range of classics,  including EchoPlex, Space  Echo, Memory Man,  DM-2, and \n   the TelRay oilcan  delay. EchoBoy's chorus  even emulates the  CE-2 chorus, \n   considered  a holy-grail  of guitar  chorus pedals.  And yes,  turn it  up! \n   EchoBoy is designed to be abused, just like real analog gear.               \n                                                                               \n   Designed for Musicians                                                      \n                                                                               \n   No math needed to figure out delay times! Just dial in a musical note value \n   and lock it to your song's tempo  with the flip of a switch. Fine-tune  the \n   echo rhythm with the Groove,  Accent, and Feel controls. With  these simple \n   controls, dial in a musical sound that fits your style. EchoBoy is the only \n   echo processor with true musical groove control.                            \n                                                                               \n   Pro Features                                                                \n                                                                               \n   Even though EchoBoy is easy to use, it's also incredibly versatile.  Switch \n   to Dual Echo or  Ping-Pong modes for powerful  stereo echo effects. Or  use \n   Rhythm mode's remarkably easy-to-use 16-tap rhythmic delay. Under the Style \n   Tweak button you'll find a 3-band parametric EQ with separate control  over \n   echo decay and tone. Choose the amount and type of analog saturation,  dial \n   in the  amount of  tape wobble,  and even  reverb-style diffusion  control. \n   There's nothing anywhere that gives you this sort of control.               \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n   FilterFreak - Resonant Analog Filter                                        \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n   We're big  on analog.  We think  that sound  is important.  So we  designed \n   FilterFreak to be fat. To be warm. To be, well, analog. All the reviews and \n   feedback say we  got it. We  also designed it  to do all  the things you do \n   with filters. From funky envelope  followers like Mutron, to classic  synth \n   style reshaping  with ADSR,  to big  resonant LFO  sweeps like  the Sherman \n   Filterbank, as well as the classic  sound of the old Morley WahWah  pedals. \n   Even two flavors of the great old Sci-Fi sample and hold sound. But a  plug \n   -in needs  to be  more. So,  we added  a unique  Rhythm Mode  that lets you \n   create  cool custom  patterns that  lock to  MIDI. A  ll the  fat and   the \n   flexibility of a whole closet full of filters and beyond.                   \n                                                                               \n   Analog Sound                                                                \n                                                                               \n   You can select emulations of different filter types to get a wide range  of \n   classic sounds.  Crank up  the resonance  to make  it squeal.  Flip on  the \n   Analog Mode switch and  hit it hard to  add Dirt, Pump, Shred  or Fat. Yep, \n   you can hit it hard coming in and going out, kind of like that old piece of \n   hardware, only  no batteries  or cables,  just great  analog sound. (Oh and \n   simulated wood side panels)                                                 \n                                                                               \n   Groovy                                                                      \n                                                                               \n   The Rhythm  Mode gets  you moving  with the  music. Flip  the MIDI  switch, \n   select 1/4 notes and  a sine wave, instant  auto wah. To get  a little more \n   creative, you can pop  open the Rhythm Editor  and create a custom  pattern \n   that  fits your  tune. (Save  that pattern  and use  it in   PhaseMistress, \n   Tremolator, or EchoBoy). Grab the Groove  knob and use swing or shuffle  to \n   drop it in the pocket. The only filter that lets you get to your sound  and \n   feel fast.                                                                  \n                                                                               \n   Double your Pleasure                                                        \n                                                                               \n   Need more power?

Each can  select from Low  Pass, High Pass,  Band Pass and  Band \n   Reject.  As well  as, 2,  4, 6,  or 8  pole filters.

SPEED is  the \n   utility that lets you  take control of the  tempo and the pitch  with three \n   different modes  to make  it easy  to get  what you  need fast  and without \n   glitchy pitch artifacts.                                                    \n                                                                               \n   Simple                                                                      \n                                                                               \n   In the Simple Mode,  the first screen you  see, you can easily  speed up or \n   slow down tempo or raise and lower pitch. Audition in real-time and see  if \n   it's the sound you want. You can even  use your ear to tune a loop to  your \n   song. Or try slowing down the  tempo while raising the pitch or  visa-versa \n   for interesting effects. By the way, SPEED also works with DigiDesign's TCE \n   (Time  compression  expansion)  Tool to  integrate  right  into Pro  Tools. \n   Simple, fast, and great sound.                                              \n                                                                               \n   Getting Graphic                                                             \n                                                                               \n   The second mode is  Graphic mode. Perhaps the  most creative of the  three, \n   Graphic Mode lets you draw lines  to slowly change pitch or tempo  or both, \n   independent of each other, over time. You can even see your waveform behind \n   the  graph  to make  it  easy to  do  interesting effects,  or  subtle time \n   shifting to  fixing tempo  errors in  a file.  You can  even use it to make \n   minor tempo shifts on overly quantized files to add a bit more humanity.    \n                                                                               \n   Calculated Effort In the Calculator  Mode there is no effort.

From the Bi-Phase,  Boss \n   Super Phaser, Phase  90, to the  Moogerfooger 12 stage,  Small Stone, Trine \n   and many more. All of which were  stacked in our test room, stock room  and \n   lining the  halls. We  needed to  be sure  PhaseMistress nailed  that rich, \n   warm, silky  analog sound.  We put  in tons  of styles  to emulate  all the \n   classics and do some  things those old boxes  couldn't do, like MIDI  sync, \n   and a large preset library.

Add  dynamic control of speed and  depth that \n   lets the tremolo respond  to the music. Then  toss in MIDI sync  to lock to \n   your tempo.  Oh, yeah,  then there's  our programmable  Rhythm Editor  that \n   let's  you write  custom patterns  and turns  this amazing  tremolo into  a \n   outrageous rhythmic auto-gate. Vintage guitar effect and modern remix  tool \n   at your service.                                                            \n                                                                               \n   Tremolo of Old                                                              \n                                                                               \n   Gear  heads that  we are,  we broke  out the  test gear  and analyzed   the \n   waveforms created by some of our favorite old gear. Then we used our custom \n   LFO waveshape editor built into Tremolator to perfectly recreate them. It's \n   very interesting to look at these shapes and see why each of these  vintage \n   pieces  has  a unique  sound.  Pass that  through  our Analog  mode,  which \n   emulates going in and out of a piece of analog hardware, and you've got all \n   the pieces of a great sounding tremolo..                                    \n                                                                               \n   Chop Shop: Auto-Gate Mania                                                  \n                                                                               \n   Switch the nice smooth tremolo waveforms over to a sharp squarewave and you \n   turn this into a monster of an auto-gate. You can lock it to MIDI with  the \n   flip of a switch, then select 1/8th notes, 16th notes or whatever fits  the \n   rhythm you  need. If  straight note  pulses isn't  what you  need, use  the \n   Rhythm Editor to  write your own  cool groove (You  can even pull  a groove \n   from our  library). More?  Add some  swing or  shuffle, accents, and analog \n   mode. You can even use the  Waveshape Editor to tighten or loosen  the gate \n   time.                                                                       \n                                                                               \n   Get Dynamic                                                                 \n                                                                               \n   In the Tweak menu you'll  find the Dynamics controls. These  parameters let \n   your playing  control the  speed and/or  depth of  the modulation.  You can \n   create cool speed ups or slow downs based on how loud or soft you play. You \n   can create  smooth increases  in depth  as your  cords fade  out, or  heavy \n   tremolo that fades away. Plus there  are already some great presets in  our \n   Dynamics folder that you can &quot;tweak&quot; to fit your needs.                     \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n   Crystallizer - Reverse Echo Effects                                         \n                                                                               \n   Inspired by the Crystal Echoes  preset in the Eventide H3000,  Crystallizer \n   combines granular reverse echo slicing and retro pitch processing to create \n   a huge range of radical sonic manipulations and classics with a twist.  Use \n   it to create synth-like textures from simple acoustic guitar rhythms,  lush \n   detuned  echos,   or  completely   psychedelic  pitch-shifted   reverseecho \n   effects. Great for drums, guitar, bass, sound design, electronic music, and \n   just about  anything else  - Crystallizer  is a  truly unique  and creative \n   effects processor.                                                          \n                                                                               \n   Crystal Method                                                              \n                                                                               \n   If you listened  to the radio  in the late  80s, you've heard  the original \n   Crystal  Echoes effect.  It's sound  was absolutely  unmistakable, and  was \n   often used on an intro or at the  end of a song to create a synth-like  pad \n   from simple guitar chords. With our new Crystallizer algorithm, we couldn't \n   help but add a few improvements.  Like MIDI sync. Yep, midi sync'd  reverse \n   delays. Now that's cool. How  about a built-in Gate/Duck control,  and high \n   -cut and  low-cut filters  to help  tame this  sometimes unruly  effect. Of \n   course, automation  is also  supported. It's  a classic  sound with  modern \n   control.                                                                    \n                                                                               \n   Retro Shifter                                                               \n                                                                               \n   Old  school pitch-shifting  just like,  uh, the  old school.  Modern  pitch \n   -shifters use sophisticated mathematical algorithms to transform music  and \n   vocals as naturally  as possible (like  our PurePitch and  SPEED products). \n   The original old school  devices (like Eventide's classic  H910 Harmonizer) \n   used a resample and cross-fade technique that introduced audible 'glitches' \n   in the  pitch-shifted audio.  Glitch is  good. Well,  in this  case it  is. \n   That's a big part of the sound. A sound we've all heard countless times, on \n   tons of hit songs.

It's used on drums, bass, vocals guitars, \n   everything. It can be  used to beef things  up, thin things out,  give them \n   some edge, fry them up  nice, add a bit of  warmth, pull things out of  the \n   mix, or even create a signature sound. Subtle to extreme, analog saturation \n   is the golden child of great mixes. That's why we took our time, bought and \n   listened to all the great  analog classics, and painstakingly created  that \n   magic for you in Decapitator.                                               \n                                                                               \n   Analog Feel                                                                 \n                                                                               \n   Decapitator is more than just an emulation of the analog sound. It has  the \n   analog  feel.  You can  hear  the subtle  changes  reacting to  the  track, \n   following the dynamics of the instrument. That's what analog is all  about. \n   Not a static snapshot (no convolution here) but a changing responsive model \n   of all  those tubes  and wires  (and careful  notes), and  transistors. The \n   sound of real gear, but with the flexibility of software. Our modeled  tone \n   control lets you shape and contour,  and our mix control lets you  mix back \n   in the dry signal  without the need for  routing and submixes. The  best of \n   both worlds.                                                                \n                                                                               \n   The Models                                                                  \n                                                                               \n   In  our  lab  we  gathered  so  much  cool  analog  gear.  From  preamps to \n   compressors. From tape machines to EQ's. Vintage gear and modern gear.  All \n   of it so we could listen to how the sound changed and moved and created its \n   special vibe.  We picked  some of  the models  that had  the most  distinct \n   sounds, the models that had a flavor both subtle and extreme, and made them \n   instantly  accessible  on  the  front  panel.  Those  5  buttons  represent \n   thousands of dollars worth of great analog gear from Neve, EMI, Ampex,  and \n   classic tube gear. By adding  analog modeled tone control we  increased the \n   sonic  possibilities  far beyond  many  of the  originals  and give  you  a \n   remarkably flexible &quot;analog&quot; palette to create with.                        \n                                                                               \n   Bad Boy                                                                     \n                                                                               \n   Because we know that audio is not always nice, we've included a  convenient \n   way to make sure it's not nice. Our &quot;Punish&quot; button kicks in another  chuck \n   of gain  to push  it over  the edge.  This tool  let's you  drive hard  and \n   responds just  like its  analog counterpart.  It screams  in pain. Not your \n   standard stomp-box distortion, Decapitator gives you those unique qualities \n   that only come from driving high end studio gear. Listen to how each  model \n   has its own sound of beautiful  agony when you hit the &quot;Punish&quot;  button and \n   crank it up.                                                                \n\n\n                  ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ                                   ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ     ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ\n                  ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â²    ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â²\n                  ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â² ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â²    ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â² ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â±   ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â²   Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â² ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â±    ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â±\n ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸    ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸    ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â±   ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸    ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸\n                                        ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸\n                  1) Unzip, Unrar and run Setup.exe \n                            \n                  2) Enjoy this fine Team AiR release !!! \n\n\n                    ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Âº ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸\n                    ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â²    ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â² ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â±    ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â±    ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â²   Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸  ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â²\n ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸    ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸     ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â±   ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸\n                                         ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸           nFO bY ThE AiRBEARS 2010  \n\n\n                          \n                  As extra we added the latest pre-version of the \n                  upcoming Decapitator plugin and we included all \n                    available preset expanders into our release    \n\n\t\t\t   \t\t\t\n\n\n\n            In case the Plugins don't show up in your VSTPlugins list\n                                                         \n                 Google for Microsoft's free Visual C++ Runtimes:    \n                                                         \n                                vcredist 2005 sp1                     \n                                                         \n                                      and                             \n                                                         \n                                vcredist 2008 sp1                      \n                                                         \n                                                         \n              Install these runtimes, reboot and rescan your plugs  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:514f6580d2324b1c12fb87eb395e6581c7ce3770","amp;dn":"SoundToys+Native+Effects+VST+RTAS+v3.1.2+AiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"514f6580d2324b1c12fb87eb395e6581c7ce3770","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,79,101,128,210,50,75,28,18,251,135,235,57,94,101,129,199,206,55,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
