The album was recorded at legendary club The Village Gate .\r\nAllMusic awarded the album 4Â½ stars with its review stating &quot; At the Village Gate is the album that first brought Herbie Mann to widespread popular attention, thanks to the inclusion of &quot;Comin' Home Baby,&quot; which soon became one of the flautist's signature songs. By the time of the record's release in 1962, however, Mann had already been a bandleader for years, honing his pioneering blend of Afro-Cuban and Brazilian music with hard bop's funky structures just under the public radar. As a result, At the Village Gate sounds more like a summation than a beginning&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:279995692554455f23c49e296384207a1b4c59fa","amp;dn":"Herbie+Mann+-+At+The+Village+Gate+%5BFlac%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"279995692554455f23c49e296384207a1b4c59fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,153,149,105,37,84,69,95,35,196,158,41,99,132,32,122,27,76,89,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
