In the half a square mile of decay and demolition that was Englandâ€™s Saxon capital, eternity is loitering between the firetrap housing projects. Embedded in the grubby amber of the districtâ€™s narrative among its saints, kings, prostitutes, and derelicts, a different kind of human time is happening, a soiled simultaneity that does not differentiate between the petrol-colored puddles and the fractured dreams of those who navigate them.\r\nEmploying, a kaleidoscope of literary forms and styles that ranges from brutal social realism to extravagant childrenâ€™s fantasy, from the modern stage drama to the extremes of science fiction, Jerusalemâ€™s dizzyingly rich cast of characters includes the living, the dead, the celestial, and the infernal in an intricately woven tapestry that presents a vision of an absolute and timeless human reality in all of its exquisite, comical, and heartbreaking splendor.\r\nIn these pages lurk demons from the second-century Book of Tobit and angels with golden blood who reduce fate to a snooker tournament. Vagrants, prostitutes, and ghosts rub shoulders with Oliver Cromwell, Samuel Beckett, James Joyceâ€™s tragic daughter Lucia, and Buffalo Bill, among many others. There is a conversation in the thunderstruck dome of St. Paulâ€™s Cathedral, childbirth on the cobblestones of Lambeth Walk, an estranged couple sitting all night on the cold steps of a Gothic church front, and an infant choking on a cough drop for eleven chapters. An art exhibition is in preparation, and above the world a naked old man and a beautiful dead baby race along the Attics of the Breath toward the heat death of the universe.\r\nAn opulent mythology for those without a pot to piss in, through the labyrinthine streets and pages of Jerusalem tread ghosts that sing of wealth, poverty, and our threadbare millennium. They discuss English as a visionary language from John Bunyan to James Joyce, hold forth on the illusion of mortality post-Einstein, and insist upon the meanest slum as Blakeâ€™s eternal holy city.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cabfe819cb5c2ddc343aa70aada8945d025a620e","amp;dn":"Jerusalem+-+Alan+Moore+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cabfe819cb5c2ddc343aa70aada8945d025a620e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,191,232,25,203,92,45,220,52,58,167,10,173,168,148,93,2,90,98,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
