It's the same as the one posted under\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3331419 however those files are (mostly)\nstereo (not necessary; it's two identical sound channels... this is dual-sided mono\nwith no pretenses at being stereo). I've also re-sampled them to a lower bit-rate;\n(32 Kb/s VBR mono, equivalent to 64 Kb/s stereo). And I've fixed the ID-3 tags because these were very inconsistently labeled so they would come in all over the\nplace in your music library. \n\nPlease keep seeding. I think this will be good for people who don't want to download \nsuch a huge file. And there is really no noticeable loss in quality. So you can fit\nall tracks on one MP-3 CD or on a flash-memory card, etc.\n\nGood luck.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad85c91f4bf57fc46df3117a62306a28dafccc4c","amp;dn":"Pimsleur+Russian+I%2C+II+and+III+--+90+lessons+--+lower+bit-rate+m","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad85c91f4bf57fc46df3117a62306a28dafccc4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,133,201,31,75,245,127,196,109,243,17,122,98,48,106,40,218,252,204,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
