The book focuses on the work of the main architects of the movement such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Adolf Loos, Le Corbusier, and Mies van der Rohe, re-examining their work and shedding new light on their roles as acknowledged masters. The author presents a fascinating analysis of architecture with regard to politics, technology, and ideology, all while offering clear descriptions of the key elements of the Modern movement.\n\nColquhoun shows clearly the evolution of the movement from Art Nouveau in the 1890s to the mega-structures of the 1960s, revealing the often-contradictory demands of form, function, social engagement, modernity and tradition.\n\nModern Architecture\nBook Language: English \nPages: 288\nFile Type: Pdf\nFile Size: 27 MB\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/4Q0ptSp.jpg[/IMG]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4Q0ptSp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4Q0ptSp.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:107faeff78fd281ac61e91d9b6dd9739056ba56f","amp;dn":"Modern+Architecture+%28Oxford+History+of+Art%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"107faeff78fd281ac61e91d9b6dd9739056ba56f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,127,174,255,120,253,40,26,198,30,145,217,182,221,151,57,5,107,165,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
