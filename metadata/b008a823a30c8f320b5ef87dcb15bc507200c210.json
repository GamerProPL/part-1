Whether recounting the first journey from the sea to the land, the development of insects and flowers, or &quot;The First Forests&quot; and &quot;The Lords of the Air&quot;, Attenborough's enthusiasm is infectious. He guides us through &quot;The Infinite Variety&quot; of life from microbes to marsupials, via an unforgettable meeting with mountain gorillas, to conclude with &quot;The Compulsive Communicators&quot;, mankind itself.\n\nThree years in the making, involving 1.5 million miles of travel and featuring some of the most beautiful, breathtaking and ambitious photography then seen on television, Life on Earth was the first natural history blockbuster. It redefined TV by showing that an epic, serious wildlife documentary could be a massive success. As such, it remains a true television landmark and paved the way for Attenborough's The Living Planet and further entries in what became known as his &quot;Life&quot; series.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b008a823a30c8f320b5ef87dcb15bc507200c210","amp;dn":"Life+on+Earth++%28BBC+1979+-+Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b008a823a30c8f320b5ef87dcb15bc507200c210","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,8,168,35,163,12,143,50,11,94,248,125,203,21,188,80,114,0,194,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
