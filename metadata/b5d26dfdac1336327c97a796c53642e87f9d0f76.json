The 19th animated feature in the Disney animated features canon, it was the last to be produced by Walt Disney, who died during its production. It was inspired by the stories about the feral child Mowgli from the book of the same name by Rudyard Kipling. The movie remains one of Disney's most popular, and contained a number of classic songs, including &quot;The Bare Necessities&quot; and &quot;I Wan'na Be Like You&quot;. Most of the songs are by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. The film was directed by Wolfgang Reitherman and his son, Bruce Reitherman, provided Mowgli's voice.\n\nMowgli (Bruce Reitherman) is found in a basket as a baby in the deep jungles of Madhya Pradesh, India. In the Disney movie, there is no mention of what happened to his parents or how he came to be there, but the basket was in half a boat in the middle of a river; so it is most likely that his parents were washed downstream and drowned. Bagheera (Sebastian Cabot), the panther who discovers the boy, promptly takes him to a wolf who has just had cubs. She raises him along with her own cubs and Mowgli soon becomes well acquainted to jungle life.\n\nMowgli is shown ten years later, visiting the wolves and getting his face licked eagerly when he arrives. That night, when the wolf tribe learns that Shere Khan (George Sanders), a man-eating tiger, has returned to the jungle, they realize that Mowgli must be taken to the man village, to protect him and those around him. Bagheera volunteers to escort him back.\n\n\n\nDirected by \tWolfgang Reitherman\n\nProduced by \tWalt Disney\n\nWritten by \tRudyard Kipling (novel)\n                Larry Clemmons\n                Ralph Wright\n                Ken Anderson\n                Vance Gerry\n\nStarring \tPhil Harris\n                Sebastian Cabot\n                Bruce Reitherman\n                George Sanders\n                Sterling Holloway\n                Louis Prima\n\nMusic by \tScore:\n                George Bruns\n\nSongs:\n                Terry Gilkyson\n                Richard M.
