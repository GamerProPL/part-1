Poirot discovers that the diamond was bought for Arlena Marshall by Sir Horace Platt and Arlena is on her honeymoon with her husband and step-daughter on a tropical island hotel. He joins them on the island and finds that everybody else starts to hate Arlena for different reasons - refusing to do a stage show, stopping a book, and for having an open affair with Patrick Redfern, another guest, in full view of his shy wife. So it's only a matter of time before Arlena turns up dead, strangled and Poirot must find out who it is... \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c3054eada6e515bc0efbc6d357a0e9c74e6cd5a","amp;dn":"Evil+Under+the+Sun+%281982%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c3054eada6e515bc0efbc6d357a0e9c74e6cd5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,48,84,234,218,110,81,91,192,239,188,109,53,122,14,156,116,230,205,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
