Griffith or F. W. Murnau, who created new editing techniques among other innovations that made the appearance of sound and color possible later on, the director as a smuggler - filmmakers such as Douglas Sirk, Samuel Fuller, and Vincente Minnelli, who used to hide subversive messages in their films and the director as an iconoclast, those filmmakers attacking social conventionalism ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Charles Chaplin, Erich von Stroheim, Orson Welles, Elia Kazan, Nicholas Ray, Stanley Kubrick, Arthur Penn, and Sam Peckinpah.\n\nVideo 1:\nFile Name .........................................: Scorsese Journey - Part 1 &amp; 2 -\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,378,043,904 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:29:05\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 672x480 (AR: 1.400)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1094 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.136 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [], [N-VOP], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n\nVideo 2: \nFile Name .........................................: Scorsese Journey - Part 3 -\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 680,941,568 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:13:37\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 672x480 (AR: 1.400)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1095 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.136 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\nEnglish audio, portuguese subtitles\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
