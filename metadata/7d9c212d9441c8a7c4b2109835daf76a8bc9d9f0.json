It is the official sequel to the wildly popular and immensely successful personal impact simulator - Stair Dismount.                                        \n                                                                                   The highlights of this experience are multiple vehicles, an awesome replay system, (some) level editing features, high-speed physics and an indiscriminate sense of style.                                                                    \n                                                                                   The purpose of the game is simple - damage awards points. It is up to you to try different combinations of obstacles, vehicles, poses and levels to make it to the top of the leaderboards. To support friendly rivalry, Turbo Dismount supports placing a photo of your friend on the face of Mr. Dismount - such a delightful way to express one's emotions!                                          \n                                      \n                      :: Ã‚Â±        KEY FEATURES       Ã‚Â±::               \n\n\n\nEarly Access edition                                                             \n                                                                                 \n \n  \n                                                          \n                      :: Ã‚Â±       iNSTALL NOTES       Ã‚Â±::\n                                                                   \n                                                                                   Run using TurboDismountTurboDismount.exe                                         \n                                                                                   Play                                                                               \n                                                                                     \n \n  \n                                                          \n                      :: Ã‚Â±     ADDiTiONAL NOTES      Ã‚Â±::\nSystem Requirements                                                               \n               Minimum:                                                                             OS: Windows XP                                                                   \n  Processor: Intel Core  or better                                                \n  Memory: 1 GB RAM                                                                 \n  Graphics: DirectX9 compatible graphics card                                      \n  DirectX: Version 9.0                                                             \n  Hard Drive: 100 MB available space                                               \n  Sound Card: Any                                                                  \n                                                                                    More Info: http://store.steampowered.com/app/63760/                               \n                                                                                     \n \n  \n                                                          \n                      :: Ã‚Â±          CREDiTS          Ã‚Â±::\n                                                          \n  \n \n3DM for Steam emu                                                                 \n                                                                                     \n                                                                                     \n \n  \n                                                          \n                      :: Ã‚Â±         GREETiNGS         Ã‚Â±::\n                                                          \n  \n \n                                                                                    \n  juchmis / friends of PPGAMES / All PP Groups / My Weed Dealer / Your MOM    \n    XANAX / TPTB / 3DM / ALI13 / OXY30 / MPOD / WTF / LOL / I8MUCHP1E / All...     \n                                                                                     \n \n  \n                                                                                 \n Ã‚Â±                     IF YOU LIKE THIS SOFTWARE, BUY IT!
