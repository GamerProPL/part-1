He was one of the main figures of the second generation of Romantic poets along with Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley, despite his work having been in publication for only four years before his death.\n\nAlthough his poems were not generally well received by critics during his life, his reputation grew after his death, so that by the end of the 19th century he had become one of the most beloved of all English poets.  He had a significant influence on a diverse range of poets and writers.  Jorge Luis Borges stated that his first encounter with Keats was the most significant literary experience of his life.  Today his poems and letters are some of the most popular and most analysed in English literature.\n\n\nThe following books are a mix of ePUB/MOBI and PDF formats:\n\n* THE COMPLETE POEMS (Penguin Classics, 2006).
