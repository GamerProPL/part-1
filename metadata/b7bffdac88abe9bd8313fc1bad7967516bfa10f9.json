On the other hand, if it was Chicago's power ballad direction of the '80s you were after, your only choice was 1989's Greatest Hits: 1982-1989. The very first collection to finally combine both eras together turned out to be the long overdue 2002 double disc from Rhino, The Very Best Of: Only the Beginning. So why another double-disc set comprised of the same exact material appeared only a year later, Chicago Story: The Complete Greatest Hits 1967-2002, is quite baffling. Of course, there's no denying the greatness of such selections as &quot;Saturday in the Park,&quot; a 'new edit' of &quot;Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?,&quot; &quot;Beginnings&quot; -- but unfortunately, the aforementioned 'lighter' later direction hasn't aged well at all (especially such fluff as &quot;You're the Inspiration&quot;). If you don't already own Only the Beginning, then the similar Complete Greatest Hits is recommended.\nAll Music Review by Greg Prato\n\n\n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] If You Leave Me Now\n[02] Hard To Say I'm Sorry\n[03] You're The Inspiration\n[04] Hard Habit To Break\n[05] Will You Still Love Me\n[06] Baby, What A Big Surprise\n[07] Look Away\n[08] What Kind Of Man Would I Be\n[09] I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love\n[10] Love Me Tomorrow\n[11] Just You 'N' Me\n[12] Happy Man [GH2 Edit]\n[13] You're Not Alone\n[14] Chasin' The Wind\n[15] Wishing You Where Here\n[16] No Tell Lover\n[17] (I've Been) Searchin' So Long\n[18] Colour My World\n[19] You Come To My Senses\n[20] We Can Last Forever\n\nCD01 Play Time - 01h:18m:52s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] 25 Or 6 To 4\n[02] Saturday In The Park\n[03] Questions 67 And 68\n[04] I'm A Man [New Edit]\n[05] Stay The Night\n[06] Only You\n[07] Dialogue (Pt. 1 &amp; 2)\n[08] Old Days\n[09] Beginnings\n[10] Lowdown\n[11] Another Rainy Day In New York City\n[12] Call On Me\n[13] Feelin' Stronger Every Day\n[14] Take Me Back To Chicago\n[15] Sing Sing Sing\n[16] Along Comes A Woman\n[17] Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is\n[18] Make Me Smile\n[19] Street Player\n\n\nCD02 Play Time - 01h:19m:04s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 02h:37m:57s\nTotal File Size....................... 374mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
