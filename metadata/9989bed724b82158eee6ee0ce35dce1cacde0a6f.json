In Cop in the Hood, Moskos reveals the truths he learned on the midnight shift.\r\n\r\nThrough Moskos's eyes, we see police academy graduates unprepared for the realities of the street, success measured by number of arrests, and the ultimate failure of the war on drugs. In addition to telling an explosive insider's story of what it is really like to be a police officer, he makes a passionate argument for drug legalization as the only realistic way to end drug violenceâ€”and let cops once again protect and serve. In a new afterword, Moskos describes the many benefits of foot patrolâ€”or, as he calls it, &quot;policing green.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9989bed724b82158eee6ee0ce35dce1cacde0a6f","amp;dn":"Cop+in+the+Hood+-+Peter+Moskos.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9989bed724b82158eee6ee0ce35dce1cacde0a6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,137,190,215,36,184,33,88,238,230,238,12,227,93,206,28,172,222,10,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
