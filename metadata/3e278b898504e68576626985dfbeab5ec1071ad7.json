Sources, ingredients, product development, processing and international regulatory issues are among the topics addressed in Wiley's Functional Food Science and Technology book series. Coverage extends to the improvement of traditional foods by cultivation, biotechnological and other means, including novel physical fortification techniques and delivery systems such as nanotechnology. Extraction, isolation, identification and application of bioactives from food and food processing by-products are among other subjects considered for inclusion in the series.\r\n\r\nSeries Editor: Professor Fereidoon Shahidi, PhD, Department of Biochemistry, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e278b898504e68576626985dfbeab5ec1071ad7","amp;dn":"Functional+Food+Science+and+Technology+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e278b898504e68576626985dfbeab5ec1071ad7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,39,139,137,133,4,230,133,118,98,105,133,223,190,171,94,193,7,26,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
