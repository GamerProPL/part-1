Set in an addicts' halfway house and a tennis academy, and featuring the most endearingly screwed-up family to come along in recent fiction, Infinite Jest explores essential questions about what entertainment is and why it has come to so dominate our lives; about how our desire for entertainment affects our need to connect with other people; and about what the pleasures we choose say about who we are. \n\nEqual parts philosophical quest and screwball comedy, Infinite Jest bends every rule of fiction without sacrificing for a moment its own entertainment value. It is an exuberant, uniquely American exploration of the passions that make us human - and one of those rare books that renew the idea of what a novel can do.\n\n----------------\n\n32 kbps, 22.05 khz, .mp3, stereo.\n\nNote: This is an unabridged reading of the novel, minus the end-notes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3c3618c12875e6e7103042d55cbe11cc92a8fd7","amp;dn":"Infinite+Jest+by+David+Foster+Wallace","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3c3618c12875e6e7103042d55cbe11cc92a8fd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,195,97,140,18,135,94,110,113,3,4,45,85,203,225,28,201,42,143,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
