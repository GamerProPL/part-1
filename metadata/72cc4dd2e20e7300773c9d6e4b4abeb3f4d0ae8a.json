I used IMGburn to make these myself. When comparing MD5 hashes of other torrents, I didn't like what I saw. So here is an alternative.\n\nThese are 3 .iso's made by me using IMGburn....and that's it.\n---HASH---\n\nDisk 1 \nFF80D2425542A2FC60C60B049305C42A\n\nDisk 2\n68DF256C09DADDD732BDA379151CBA88\n\nDisk 3\n68E3C2DC5E0D53EE30E8657C385169F2\n\nThe SWGemu is up and running (in 2012- yes, it's true) Go to www.swgemu.com to register. \nThis torrent exists for those who may be missing a disk or two or they may be too scratched to be read from.\n\nThe game DOES work in Windows 7 x64. (You will get an error saying it might not work-it does)\nNo- you can't play offline.\n\nCome enjoy the best MMORPG ever once again.\n\nDon't mention the word torrent EVER when you are a part of the SWGemu community.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72cc4dd2e20e7300773c9d6e4b4abeb3f4d0ae8a","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Galaxies+-+Complete+Original+Disk+Set+%282012+upload%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72cc4dd2e20e7300773c9d6e4b4abeb3f4d0ae8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,204,77,210,226,14,115,0,119,60,157,110,75,74,190,179,244,208,174,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
