By the time Chic appeared in the late '70s, disco was already slipping into the excess that eventually caused its downfall. Chic bucked the trend by stripping disco's sound down to its basic elements; their funky, stylish grooves had an organic sense of interplay that was missing from many of their overproduced competitors. Chic's sound was anchored by the scratchy, James Brown-style rhythm guitar of Nile Rodgers and the indelible, widely imitated (sometimes outright stolen) bass lines of Bernard Edwards; as producers, they used keyboard and string embellishments economically, which kept the emphasis on rhythm. Chic's distinctive approach not only resulted in some of the finest dance singles of their time, but also helped create a template for urban funk, dance-pop, and even hip-hop in the post-disco era. Not coincidentally, Rodgers and Edwards wound up as two of the most successful producers of the '80s. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tSoul and R&amp;B\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Dance Dance Dance (Yowsah Yowsah Yowsah)\n02.Everybody Dance (12 Mix)\n03.Strike Up The Band\n04.Chic Cheer\n05.Le Freak\n06.I Want Your Love\n07.Good Times\n08.My Feet Keep Dancing\n09.My Forbidden Lover\n10.Soup For One\n11.Savoir Faire\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bad6ae5e15a59185487464d102049c55741d0499","amp;dn":"Chic+-+The+Best+Of+Chic+%281991%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bad6ae5e15a59185487464d102049c55741d0499","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,214,174,94,21,165,145,133,72,116,100,209,2,4,156,85,116,29,4,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
