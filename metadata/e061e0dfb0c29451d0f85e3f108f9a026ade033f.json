POD Farm 2.5 offers hand-picked essentials that no recording guitarist should be without.\nCredits go to Team V.R. who provided the original unlocker, however the only way it worked was by opening and installing the pkg via Pacifist.\n\n\nInstructions:\n\nInstall PODFarm 2, don't click restart at the end.\n\nDelete framework file-- Macintosh HD /Library/Frameworks/L6TWXY.framework\n\nDrag the cracked L6TWXY.framework into-- Macintosh HD /Library/Frameworks/\n\nNow you can reboot. \n\nWhen you start POD Farm for the first time, it should NOT say &quot;No license found, running in trial mode&quot; or similar.
