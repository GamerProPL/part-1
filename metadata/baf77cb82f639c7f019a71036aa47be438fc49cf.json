Thus, the essential ideas  of game theory are here presented\nin  the context  of actual  games, real  games much  more complex  and\nrich  than the  typical toy  examples. All  the fundamental  ideas are\nhere:  Nash equilibria,  backward  induction, elementary  probability,\nimperfect information, extensive and normal form, mixed and behavioral\nstrategies.  The active-learning,  example-driven  approach makes  the\ntext suitable  for a course  taught through problem  solving. Students\nwill  be  thoroughly engaged  by  the  extensive classroom  exercises,\ncompelling homework  problems and nearly  sixty projects in  the text.\nAlso available are  approximately eighty Java applets  and three dozen\nExcel  spreadsheets in  which  students can  play  games and  organize\ninformation in order to acquire a  gut feeling to help in the analysis\nof the  games. Mathematical exploration is  a deep form of  play, that\nmaxim is embodied in this book.\n\nGame  Theory  Through  Examples  is  a  lively  introduction  to  this\nappealing  theory.  Assuming  only  high  school  prerequisites  makes\nthe  volume  especially  suitable  for   a  liberal  arts  or  general\neducation  spirit-of-mathematics  course.  It   could  also  serve  as\nthe  active-learning  supplement  to  a   more  abstract  text  in  an\nupper-division game theory course.\n\n-_-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baf77cb82f639c7f019a71036aa47be438fc49cf","amp;dn":"Game+Theory+Through+Examples+-+Erich+Prisner.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baf77cb82f639c7f019a71036aa47be438fc49cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,247,124,184,47,99,156,127,1,154,113,3,106,164,123,228,56,252,73,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
