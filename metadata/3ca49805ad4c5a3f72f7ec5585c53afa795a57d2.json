The band self-released their first full-length album entitled Embryonic Anomaly in late 2009. Four months later Unique Leader Records signed the band and Embryonic Anomaly was re-released internationally under the label on May 28th, 2010. Since then, Rings of Saturn has been hard at work touring nationwide throughout the United States and Canada promoting Embryonic Anomaly as well as their second album release entitled Dingir (din-jeer). A third full length album entitled &quot;Lugal Ki En&quot; is scheduled to be released for 2014.\n\n\n\nReview:\n\n\nQuote:\nThere is something I have never truly understood when it comes to the negativity that surrounds this band. Sure there are some deathcore elements tied within the technical death metal and their brand of tech is really out of this world. But by metalhead standards, this surely exceeds it. I mean the vocals by Ian Bearer have only got better since he first joined the band, Lucas and Joel are creative as all hell on their instruments and drumming and bass work are not slacking by any means. The gang return from a highly successful album with Lugal Ki En and the galactic theme does not slow down by any means. As a matter of fact, it only burns faster.\n\n\nRoSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ technical death metal is more or less hyperactive and frantic when it comes to everything. The radical guitar work is more honed in and focused on this release though. While they have grown on each album, Lugal Ki En is a drastic improvement in writing, sound and execution. The experimentation still comes out and you will here this over and over again, the biggest stand out to me was the intro to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lalassu XulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which has a really silly beginning but that derpy introduction turns into something you just tap your foot to and move your head. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fantastic.\n\nLucas Mann and Joel Omans dual guitar slaughter offer us groove, NES styled action plat-former tricks and astronomical tone. The low end is killer and they do not always focus on breakdowns anymore for rhythm sections. Sure, there are some chunky bits and pieces there that could be mistaken for Ã¢â‚¬Å“coreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just solid and simple riffing. Take Ã¢â‚¬Å“InfusedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for example: really slow and low main riff, with something else complicated over that then a layered guitar solo over that. Rusty Cooley himself is the guest solo on that track! ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just oozing masterful and is one of my favorite tracks on the album.\n\nBass work is handled by Lucas but he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just simply play boring riffs, he puts some technical licks on that thing. Sometimes coming out progressive at times. Album drummer is not their new live drummer Aaron Stechauner. The drumming performed on Lugal Ki En is actually Aaron Kitcher (Black Tongue/Infant Annihilator) and his sound is identical to the drum sound on IAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last album. The sound is way better than Ã¢â‚¬Å“DingirÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ but is still resonates a digital sound, which works well with me. The grueling speed and particular drum tone fits like a glove with the guitar work.\n\nLine-up:\n\nLucas Mann- Guitars\nJoel Omans- Guitars\nIan Bearer- Vocals\nAaron Stechauner - Drums\n\n\nRings Of Saturn - Lugal Ki En (2014)\n\n\n\n\nCBR @ 320kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
