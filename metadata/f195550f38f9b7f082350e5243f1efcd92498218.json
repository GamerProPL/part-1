It's 1983, and the schools are breaking up for summer. Shaun\nis 12 and a bit of a loner, growing up with his mum in a grim coastal town,\nhis dad killed fighting in the Falklands War. On his way home from school\nwhere he's been tormented all day for wearing flares, he runs into a group\nof skinheads, who against expectations turn out to be friendly and take him\nunder their wing. Soon Shaun discovers parties, girls and snappy dressing,\nand finds some role models in Woody, Milky and the rest of the gang. But\nwhen an older, overtly racist skinhead returns home from prison, the easy\ncamaraderie of the group is broken, and Shaun is drawn into much more\nuncomfortable territory. Based largely on his own experience as a youngster,\nthis is Shane Meadows' most mature and fully realised film. Handling the\ncomplexities of masculinity, violence and race with sensitivity and a\nlightness of touch, it's hard to imagine a film that would better capture\nthe mood of the time, or that could have any greater an understanding of\nthe allure of being part of a gang.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Thomas Turgoose.\n=&gt;-Stephen Graham.\n=&gt;-Jo Hartley.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Shane Meadows.\n\nThis Is England '86.\nThe story takes place during the 1986 FIFA World Cup. As Shaun completes his\nlast school exam, he realises he will have to find his way in the world. His\nfriends, who include Woody, Lol, Smell, Gadget and Meggy, are still around,\nlooking for love, entertainment and employment.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Thomas Turgoose.\n=&gt;-Stephen Graham.\n=&gt;-Joseph Gilgun.\n\nDirectors.\n=&gt;-Tom Harper.\n=&gt;-Shane Meadows.\n\nThis Is England '88.\nSet during Christmas 1988, Lol is haunted by the devastating events that\ntook place two and a half years before. She and Woody both find themselves\nstruggling to cope with their lives without each other after he leaves the\ngang. Lol is carrying the burden of her guilt, whilst Woody is trying to\nbuild a domestic life with a new girlfriend and a potential promotion at\nwork.
