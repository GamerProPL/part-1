From web application developers, to systems integrators, to system administratorsÃ¢â‚¬â€this book has everything that you need to know.\n\nAbout the Author\nBrandon Rhodes is a consulting programmer who also teaches the Python language professionally for organizations that are adding the language to their tool set. He has spoken at PyOhio; at PyGotham; at national PyCon conferences in Canada, Ireland, and Poland; and at Django conferences in Portland, Wales, and Warsaw, where he was delighted at the creativity of the organizers, who rented a circus tent for the occasion. He will chair the flagship PyCon North America conference in Portland in 2016Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2017. Brandon is interested in how ideas like the Clean Architecture can help programmers organize code more effectively and in what we can learn from writers in other fields about offering kind and actionable critiques of each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work. He currently lives in tiny Bluffton, Ohio, with his wife Jackie and their two cats.\n\nPublisher: Apress; 3rd ed. 2014 edition (27 October 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1430258543\nISBN-13: 978-1430258544","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2586fcccfd5efdbb0213ecaad0b5930648c2da25","amp;dn":"Foundations+of+Python+Network+Programming%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2586fcccfd5efdbb0213ecaad0b5930648c2da25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,134,252,204,253,94,253,187,2,19,236,170,208,181,147,6,72,194,218,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
