The band originated in Boston, Massachusetts, with lead \n\nsinger and rhythm guitarist Ric Ocasek, lead singer and bassist Benjamin \n\nOrr, lead guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboardist Greg Hawkes and drummer David \n\nRobinson. They were signed to Elektra Records by George Daly, then A&amp;R \n\nhead, in 1977.\n\nThe Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with \n\nthe new synth-oriented pop that was then becoming popular and which would \n\nflower in the early 1980s. The Cars started fresh with their debut album The \n\nCars which went on to go platinum in late 1978. The Cars' debut album was \n\ncalled a &quot;genuine rock masterpiece&quot; by Allmusic. The most successful and \n\nwell known song from the album, &quot;Just What I Needed&quot;, started as a demo in \n\n1977. The song was sent as a mix tape to a local DJ in the Boston area, who \n\nplayed the song in heavy rotation. This soon caught the attention of other \n\nDJs, which led to the signing of the band by Elektra Records in 1977.\n\n\n The Cars have used genres that spanned through all of rock and pop music, including new wave, pop rock, protopunk, garage rock, and bubblegum pop.They have also used rockabilly in songs such as &quot;My Best Friend's Girl&quot;. Robert Palmer, music critic for The New York Times and Rolling Stone, described The Cars' musical style by saying: &quot;they have taken some important but disparate contemporary trendsÃ¢â‚¬â€punk minimalism, the labyrinthine synthesizer and guitar textures of art rock, the '50s rockabilly revival and the melodious terseness of power popÃ¢â‚¬â€and mixed them into a personal and appealing blend.&quot; They have also had hard rock-oriented songs including &quot;You're All I've Got Tonight.&quot;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cars&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cars&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/the-cars&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/the-cars&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fc205b4bb59eed2576fa0c49b9f123511886773","amp;dn":"The+Cars+-+Discography+-+320+kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fc205b4bb59eed2576fa0c49b9f123511886773","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,194,5,180,187,89,238,210,87,111,160,196,155,159,18,53,17,136,103,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
