The CD covers the years 1975 - 1988, when the group consisted of Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie, John McVie, and Mick Fleetwood. Although the group formed in 1967 as a blues rock band, they didn't start having big hits in the United States until this period. The CD includes 14 of their 16 U.S. Top 20 hits - only &quot;Don't Think About Me&quot; (#20 in 1980) and &quot;Seven Wonders&quot; (#19 in 1987) are excluded.\n\nFleetwood Mac recorded some of the most brilliant California pop-rock of the 1970s and 1980s, and this collection represents it well. Their enduring popularity is witnessed by the over eight millions copies this record has sold. In addition, having three talented lead singers and song writers helps make their music so varied. I particularly enjoy Stevie's songs, such as &quot;Rhiannon&quot; (which went to #11, not #5 as stated in the Editorial Review) and &quot;Dreams.&quot;\n\nTwo additional songs were recorded for inclusion on this set (Lindsey Buckingham had left the group by then). &quot;As Long as You Follow&quot; features a solid vocal by Christine McVie and peaked on the Top 100 at #43 in 1989. &quot;No Questions Asked&quot; is a somewhat cluttered-sounding song featuring Stevie Nicks that's not a particularly strong addition.\n\nSince the release of this CD, of course, Fleetwood Mac has reunited. They also subsequently released the 2-disk &quot;The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac,&quot; which covers 35 of their songs. Whether you prefer to purchase this CD or the more extensive one obviously would seem to rest on how much depth your Fleetwood Mac collection already has and how deep you want it to go. I'm sticking with this one as I have several of their studio CDs that help fill in some of the gaps, such as the sublime &quot;Landslide.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nFleetwood Mac - Greatest Hits\n\nArtist...............: Fleetwood Mac\nAlbum................: Greatest Hits\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1988 11\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 62 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 260kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\nTracklisting\n\n1.
