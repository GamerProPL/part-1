At the heart of it all is The Little Girl, who's being prepared by her mother for the very grown-up world in which they live - only to be interrupted by her eccentric, kind-hearted neighbor, The Aviator. The Aviator introduces his new friend to an extraordinary world where anything is possible. A world that he himself was initiated into long ago by The Little Prince. It's here that The Little Girl's magical and emotional journey into her own imagination - and into the universe of The Little Prince - begins. And it's where The Little Girl rediscovers her childhood and learns that ultimately, it's human connections that matter most, and that what's truly essential can only be seen with the heart.\r\n\r\ncast\r\n\r\nThe Little Girl:...Mackenzie Foy(voice)\r\nThe Aviator:...Jeff Bridges(voice)\t\r\nThe Mother:...Rachel McAdams(voice)\r\nThe Little Prince:...Riley Osborne(voice)\r\nMr. Prince:...Paul Rudd(voice)\r\nThe Fox:...James Franco(voice)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo:-\r\n\r\nFormat :mkv/AVC \r\nWriting Library :x264    \r\nDuration : 1h 46mn 34 \r\nBitrate :  3 128 Kbps \r\nResolution=Width/Height : 1 920  x  816 pixels \r\nFrame Rate : 23.976 fps\r\n\r\nAudio:-\r\n\r\nFormat : AC-3 \r\nBitrate :  640 Kbps\r\nChannels :6 Channels\r\nChannel Positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nSample Rate : 48KHz\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nRelease info:-\r\n\r\nEncoded/Released By :tomcat12/ETRG \r\nTitle/Year : &quot;The Little Prince&quot; / 2015\r\nFile Size : 2.80 GiB\r\nGenre :  Animation | Fantasy \r\nSource : BluRay REMUX - BHD [Thanks]\r\nChapters : Yes \r\nSample : Yes \r\nSubtitles(VobSub): English(SDH),English_Forced,French.\r\nSubtitles(srt): English(SDH),English_Forced,Arabic,Greek,Indonesian,Persian. \r\nIMDB :   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1754656/\r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/gB3 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/gB9 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/gBM \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/gBU \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/gBz \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/gB0 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/gBJ \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/gBK \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/gBZ\r\n        \r\n\r\nGreetz To: SaM |ozi|juggs|LRS|SureNdrA|Psix|Masta|MgB|Hand_of_Doom|BADASSMEDIA|FWOLF|Extratorrent|.\r\n\r\n\r\nMake sure it is Genuine ETRG release @ ExtraTorrent.cc or from our Trusted Accounts elswhere","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a983a5f770521968459a5d57ecc94ccd215ad2b","amp;dn":"The.Little.Prince.2015.1080p.BluRay.AC3.x264-ETRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a983a5f770521968459a5d57ecc94ccd215ad2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,152,58,95,119,5,33,150,132,89,165,213,126,204,148,204,210,21,173,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
