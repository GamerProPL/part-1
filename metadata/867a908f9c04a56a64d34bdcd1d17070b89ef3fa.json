As well as tougher opponents the fights take place in more complex arenas as the game progresses. While deathmatch maps are designed for up to 16 players, tournament maps are designed for duels between 2 players and in the single-player game could be considered as 'boss battles'. The weapons are balanced by role, with each weapon having advantages in certain situations such as at long-range or fired around a corner; the BFG is an exception to this as a super-weapon. Weapons appear as level items, spawning at regular intervals in set locations on the map. If a player dies all their weapons are lost and they receive the spawn weapons for the current map, usually the gauntlet and machine gun. Players also drop the weapon they were using when killed, which other players can then pick up.\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:\nCPU: Intel Pentium IV (or higher)\nRAM: 512 MB\nVGA: 64MB DirectX 9.0c compatible video card\nDX: DirectX 9.0c\nGRAPHICS: NVIDIA GeForce 3 or above, ATI Radeon 8500 or above, or 3D cards of the same grade\nOS: Windows ME,2000,XP Professional\nHDD: 1GB of HD space\nSound:\tDirectX compatible Sound Card\nODD: 8X CD-ROM\n\nAFTER DOWNLOAD UNRAR THE FILE; RUN SET-UP FILE TO INSTALL &amp; DONE.\nINSERT ANY CD KEY(Eg.-Your Name) FOR THE FIRST TIME WHILE PLAYING.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:867a908f9c04a56a64d34bdcd1d17070b89ef3fa","amp;dn":"Quake+3+Arena+-Full+Version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"867a908f9c04a56a64d34bdcd1d17070b89ef3fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,122,144,143,156,4,165,106,100,211,75,220,209,209,112,112,184,158,243,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
