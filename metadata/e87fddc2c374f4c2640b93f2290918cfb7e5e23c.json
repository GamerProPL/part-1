The novel had enormous influence on twentieth-century literature.  Edmund White pronounced it &quot;the most respected novel of the twentieth century&quot;, while Virginia Woolf marvelled: &quot;Oh, if I could write like that!&quot;\n\nThe book was initially translated into English by C. K. Scott Moncrieff and appeared under the title REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST between 1922 and 1931.  Scott Moncrieff translated volumes one through six of the seven volumes, dying before completing the last.  The final volume, Le Temps retrouvÃƒÂ©, was published as &quot;Time Regained&quot; (1931), translated by Stephen Hudson (a pseudonym of Sydney Schiff).  (The original Scott Moncrieff translation can still be found on this site but the quality of the copy is very poor.)  Terence Kilmartin revised the Scott Moncrieff translation in 1981, using the new French edition of 1954.\n\nMODERN LIBRARY Edition.  The title IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME, a more literal rendering of the French, has gained usage since D. J. Enright adopted it for his revised translation of Scott Moncrieff/Kilmartin published by the Modern Library in 1992.  It was based on the latest, most complete and authoritative French text, the &quot;La PlÃƒÂ©iade&quot; edition (1987-89).  It provides a detailed plot synopsis at the end of each volume, endnotes, and alternative versions of some of the novel's famous episodes.  The Modern Library edition is presented here in its six individual volumes as well as the omnibus one-volume edition.\n\nPENGUIN Edition.  In 1995, Penguin undertook a fresh translation by a team of seven different translators overseen by general editor Christopher Prendergast.  Its six volumes, comprising Proust's seven, were published in 2002.  Like the Modern Library edition, the Penguin translations provide a detailed plot synopsis at the end of each volume.  They also provide an extensive set of brief, non-scholarly endnotes that help identify cultural references perhaps unfamiliar to contemporary English readers.\n\nFor more on Proust's masterpiece -- synopses, themes, critical reception, and overview of the different English translations -- see the Wikipedia article at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time\n\n\nAll the following books are in both ePUB + MOBI format:\n\n* IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME (Modern Library, 1992).  6 volumes.
