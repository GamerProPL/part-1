Those familiar with the WarCraft series \nshould feel at home here, as the interface and control \nscheme are similar to those of Warcraft Ii: Tides Of Darkness. However, this is where the similarities end.\n\nIn Starcraft, there are three unique races to choose from, different in almost every way. The Terrans, \nwho might be described as &quot;hillbillies in space,&quot; represent the human race. They are a group with adaptable machinery and powerful, \nweapon-ready units. The second race is the Zerg, an organic-based alien race that spawns larvae from its creepy colonies. They have the ability to \nmultiply quickly, creating safety in numbers. Zerg larvae can mutate into different kinds of structures and units. The Protoss are the most profound of the three races, relying on long-term strategies and advanced, almost mystical machinery.\n\nEach race offers distinct strengths and weaknesses, and each calls for a different style of play. \nUnlike the single-player campaigns in WarCraft (which had two effectively similar races), the three campaigns \nin Starcraft must be played in order, as they are each a part of a larger tale. The story is of epic scale, \nbeginning with the Terrans, then moving on to the Zerg, and finishing with the Protoss. Each race has its own campaign and plot line, but they all flow together as one big story.\n\nMultiplayer options are supported through Blizzard&amp;#039;s BattleNet servers. Those who think they&amp;#039;re good enough can test their battle skills against other human players online. There are also options that allow players to team up and fight against the computer&amp;#039;s armies. Michael L.
