Players control their own Sims in activities and relationships in a exact manner to real life. The gameplay is open-ended and indefinite. Sim houses and neighborhoods are entirely in one continuous map. The developers stated, &quot;What you do outside your home now matters as much as what you do within.&quot; One of the biggest changes to the franchise is the use of rabbit-holes. Sims aren't allowed to go inside the majority of city buildings; instead, they simply disappear inside for a certain amount of timeÃ¢â‚¬â€a feature known in video games as a rabbit-hole[citation needed]Ã¢â‚¬â€while the player is given several choices on what happens inside using a text-based notification.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b79abe03351c4acac105188dc4a260bb0cd0b223","amp;dn":"The+Sims+3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b79abe03351c4acac105188dc4a260bb0cd0b223","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,154,190,3,53,28,74,202,193,5,24,141,196,162,96,187,12,208,178,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
