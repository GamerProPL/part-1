Build highly interactive online and mobile courses with Articulate Storyline, the only e-learning authoring software that grows with you. Itâ€™s simple enough for beginners, powerful enough for experts.\t\r\n\r\nIntuitive User Interface\r\nWhat learning curve? Weâ€™ve designed Storyline from the ground up to simplify your life. Itâ€™s so intuitive and easy to use that you can get started right awayâ€”thereâ€™s no training required. If youâ€™ve used PowerPoint, youâ€™ll feel right at home.\r\n\r\nSlide Templates\r\nBuild your slides from scratch or start from a template. You can even use templates with interactivity common to e-learning courses already built in. Easily customize a template to make it completely yours. Don't see what you want? No problem. Free slide interactions and course templates are posted to E-Learning Heroes all the time. Simply download and then access your new templates from within Storyline.\r\n\r\nCharacters\r\nConnect more fully with learners by using characters in your course. Itâ€™s easy to add up to 47,500 combinations of illustrated and photographic characters, expressions, and posesâ€”thereâ€™s no need to hunt for art online. With just a few clicks, you can insert characters, then change their poses and expressions. Extend your character library with additional Articulate character packs.\r\n\r\nSlide Layers\r\nDrastically simplify how you create interactivity with slide layers, the innovative new way of building multiple interactions on a single slide. Slide layers let you quickly and easily overlay objects, and trigger layers to appear when learners take certain actions. No more duplicating and managing multiple slides. With slide layers, you create, edit, and manage multiple interactions on one slideâ€”so you can author courses faster than ever.\r\n\r\nTriggers\r\nBuild interactivity by choosing from a menu of easy-to-understand actions, such as â€œjump to slideâ€ or â€œshow a layer.â€ Then, designate when you want the action to occur, such as when a user clicks on a certain object. Combine triggers to create increasingly complex interactions.\r\n\r\nStates\r\nMake objects feel alive by setting them to react to a learnerâ€™s actions. Set a button to change color after itâ€™s been visited, or change the expression of a character when the learner clicks the wrong object. The possibilities are endless.\r\n\r\nVariables\r\nAdd intelligence to your course using variables. Present dynamic content based on a learnerâ€™s activity and other conditions you define. Remember learner input or assessment resultsâ€”and use the information later in your course if it meets your criteria. For example, if learner responses arenâ€™t up to par, present additional slides at the end of the course to help them master the material.\r\n\r\nHTML5, Flash, and Mobile Devices\r\nNow you can get courses to learners wherever they are. Build your course once, then publish it with a single click to multiple formats so learners can interact with it on their iPads, desktops, laptops, and more. Storyline publishes to Flash, which is supported by a vast majority of personal computers, and to the Articulate Mobile Player, a native iOS application that optimizes courses for iPads. Storyline also publishes to HTML5, an increasingly popular format for delivering content with rich multimedia and interactivity.\r\n\r\nWhat's new in Articulate Storyline 2 \nhttps://www.articulate.com/products/storyline-whats-new.php","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cdaa3e6f64e38c6e01f8cc5e82032f1d6d18f48","amp;dn":"Articulate+Storyline+2.8.1605.515+%2B+Crack+%5BSadeemPC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cdaa3e6f64e38c6e01f8cc5e82032f1d6d18f48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,218,163,230,246,78,56,198,224,31,140,197,232,32,50,241,214,209,143,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
