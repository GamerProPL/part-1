He hires Byomkesh to investigate the possible murderer, but before Byomkesh can do anything, BBenimadhab and his manservant are murdered. Byomkesh arrives at the scene of crime to find a web of deceit that he has to unravel..\n\nComments:\nBased largely on Saradindu Bandyopadhyay's short story (Beni Sanghar), Anjan Dutta sticks largely to the original. There are some minor variations and the purist will notice them immediately, but I thought Anjan Dutt's interpretation is very plausible and does not take much away from the original story. To be honest I did not come across anything that may be called a glaring fault, except perhaps the elopement of Parag and Laboni, something that was unnecessary.\nIf Byomkesh is a little abrasive and Satyabati a little too strident, it is a minor quibble, for overall, Anjan Dutt tells a very satisfying tale.\n\nCredit for that undoubtedly goes to the screenplay writer and director Anjan Dutt, but editor Arghyakamal Dutta does a very good job, as does cinematographer Indraneel Mukherjee. If the dresses are a little modern compared to the original setting, it is a minor failing. The music for the film is perhaps just a bit pedestrian.\n\nThis is a film that I unabashedly enjoyed! I'm sure you will too.\n\n\nUploader's Notes:\nAlthough this is a PDVD rip, I think you will find that the quality is good enough to pass off as a full DVD rip. The source was good and with some color correction and deblocking, we are able to provide you with a picture that will not take much away from your entertainment. Unfortunaely, since this is a pDVD, we are not able to provide subtitles. Nor would a upscale be feasible as the source is too blocky, but we will try and provide a x264 version of this rip as well, perhaps by tomorrow.\n\nBe aware though that this rip (and all HEVC rips) will not play on any stand-alone device. You can only watch this on a computer. Be sure that you have the latest versions of VLC or Media Player Classic or SMPlayer. Earlier versions may not work\n\nthe pDVD is sourced from the web. My thanks to the original uploader.\n\nIMDB Link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt4282396/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt4282396/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wIs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wIs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wIn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wIn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wIj&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wIj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wIT&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wIT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wIw&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wIw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wIa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wIa&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc97d81cc61704ab8efcc26a5de50a8fe001efa5","amp;dn":"Byomkesh.Phire.Elo+%282014%29-BENGALI-Web.Rip-x265.-493MB-DDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc97d81cc61704ab8efcc26a5de50a8fe001efa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,151,216,28,198,23,4,171,142,252,194,106,93,229,10,143,224,1,239,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
