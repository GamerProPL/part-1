It seemed as if it was filmed with virtually no budget, the sets and atmosphere were completely dingy, the setting and much of the language was foreign to me, and it felt like a kind of homemade independent film. However, upon a second viewing, I see it for the richly-textured masterpiece that it is, and for the awesome attention to detail that must have gone into it which I had taken for granted the first time.\n\nThere have been other films with similar subject matter in alternate settings of cultured men reduced to a kind of forgotten primitivity, but I think the thing that sets this movie apart is the fact that director Ted Kotcheff remains completely neutral toward all of the characters - both the cultured schoolteacher as well as the locals. By the end of the film, no character remains unscathed, and yet no character is completely without sympathy, either. It must be quite difficult for a director to remain impartial, especially when most stories require audience sympathy for a protagonist versus an antagonist for story momentum. This impartiality establishes an incredible realism in the film which is difficult to shake off. Here, as in life, things just happen to the main character organically - whether there is any rhyme, reason, or moral to any of it is the complete burden of the audience to figure out.\n\nAnother key aspect to the film is its universality. Most people would like to believe that in the modern world, and especially a modern country such as Australia or the U.S, that such ugly colloquial primitivity has been largely purged from polite society, but they would be quite wrong. I can equate some of my own personal experiences with those of the main character in this film, and so felt an uncomfortable recognition as I was watching this. Moroever, virtually every scene in the film I could envision actually occurring - something I cannot say about any other I can think of. Sam Peckinpah\\'s filmic explorations of perverse masculinity, some of Samuel Fuller\\'s work, and DELIVERANCE are the only movies that achieve something close to the kind of effect this movie has, and even Peckinpah felt the need to resort to flashy cinematic stylistics to get his points across.\n\nThis movie has not aged one bit, and probably never will. It is a tragedy that it has all but disappeared even in its own country of Australia. Director Kotcheff displayed an amazing early talent; it is too bad that his career never reached another peak like this - even in FIRST BLOOD and UNCOMMON VALOR - two of his other films with similar themes. And that the same man ended up directing WEEKEND AT BERNIE\\'S and episodes of Zalman King\\'s RED SHOE DIARIES!!! \n\nThe world is a crazy place, and one need only watch this film to realize this fact. \n\n- Sturgeon54\n\n\n\n\n\nMovie Info:\n    _________________________________________________\n    Wake in Fright (1971)                   \n    GENRE..: Drama, Thriller                                     \n    RATiNG.: 6.5/10                                   \n    IMDB..: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067541/             \n   \n    \n    Release Info:\n    _________________________________________________  \n    RELEASE DATE..: 11-07-2009                                             \n    RUNTiME.......: 1:48:54                                                    \n    SiZE..........: 2.45 gb                                                  \n    ViDEO.CODEC...: x264                                            \n    FRAMERATE.....: 23.976                                                   \n    BiTRATE.......: 3000 kbps                                                \n    RESOLUTiON....: 1280x688                                                 \n    AUDiO.........: Audio 1)  English AC3 2.0 224 kbps;\n                                       \n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:103208295b204e6e8da2a3214992daf3593f8c4f","amp;dn":"WAKE+IN+FRIGHT+%28OUTBACK%29+%281971%29+-+m720p+MKV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"103208295b204e6e8da2a3214992daf3593f8c4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,50,8,41,91,32,78,110,141,162,163,33,73,146,218,243,89,63,140,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
