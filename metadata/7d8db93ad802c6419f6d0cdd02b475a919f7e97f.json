The band has evolved through the years and created itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own style of music. After three years of searching for musicians that had this passion towards extreme progressive death metal music, Kevin Chartre (co-worker of Simon Girard) presented Guyot Begin-Benoit to him. After auditioning, the band decided to accept him in the formation and a couple of months later, Nicolas Domingo Viotto decided to quit the band. Ironically, Kevin Chartre took his place and during January 2010, after listening to the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s song called Ã‚Â«Injustice RevealedÃ‚Â», Dominic Ã‚Â«ForestÃ‚Â» Lapointe contacted them to join the formation. And this is how Beyond Creation finally came to life.\n\nNow with the complete line-up, Beyond Creation is ready to bring you to outer spaces with itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique and powerful sounds. Incorporating melodic to extreme blasting metal, with progressive and technical riff, without forgetting these growls vocals from under grave, the band is a mix of influences of many different kind.\n\nCurrent Line-up:\n\n\n  - Dominic &quot;Forest&quot; Lapointe: Bass (2005-present)\n\n  - Simon Girard: Vocals, Guitars (2005-present)\n\n  - KÃƒÂ©vin ChartrÃƒÂ©: Guitars (2007-present)\n\n\n  - Philippe Boucher: Drums (2012-present)\n\n\n\nPast Members:\n\n\n  - Guyot Begin-Benoit: Drums (2005-2012)\n\n  - Nicolas Domingo Viotto: Guitars (2005-2007)\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\n  1.
