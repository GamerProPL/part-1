Over the last few decades, we've forgotten what &quot;real food&quot; isÃ¢â‚¬â€and we're left desperately seeking foods that will truly nourish our bodies. We're disillusioned with the &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; for good reasonÃ¢â‚¬â€it's gotten us nowhere.\n\nAchieving optimal health without calorie-counting, diet foods, or feelings of deprivation has never been easier. Practical Paleo explains why avoiding both processed foods and foods marketed as &quot;healthy&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€like grains, legumes, and pasteurized dairyÃ¢â‚¬â€will improve how you look and feel and lead to lasting weight loss.

Are you an athlete? Do you suffer from digestive distress? Have you been diagnosed with an autoimmune condition? Maybe you just want to live a long life and look good naked! Whatever your goals, Diane has done the heavy lifting by condensing the science and a lot of practical how-tos into bite-size pieces.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Robb Wolf, New York Times best-selling author of The Paleo Solution\n\n&quot;The recipes in Practical Paleo are nothing short of exceptional. I say this without hesitation because I tasted every single dish in this book. Watching Diane cook was inspiring, and I'm proud to say I learned much more about cooking just from being in the kitchen with her. This book will not only feed your brain with knowledge of health, but also nourish your body with outstanding recipes.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Hayley Mason, co-author of Make it Paleo\n\n&quot;Practical Paleo is a gold mine for those new to the Paleo diet or struggling to integrate it into their everyday lives. I've always believed that personalization is the key to long-term success, and Diane's 30-Day Meal Plans will help you achieve just that. Practical Paleo will prove to be a resource I recommend to my patients and online community again and again.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Chris Kresser, LA.c, integrative-medicine practitioner\n\n\nPractical Paleo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ August 7, 2012\nBook Language: English \nPages: 578\nFile Type: Pdf, Epub, Mobi\nFile Size: 36.89 MB\n\n\nISBN-10: 1936608758\nISBN-13: 978-1936608751\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MYBsUtl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MYBsUtl.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3720a331d97b176dee11ecebdf29103c18401376","amp;dn":"Practical+Paleo+-+Diane+Sanfilippo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3720a331d97b176dee11ecebdf29103c18401376","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,32,163,49,217,123,23,109,238,17,236,235,223,41,16,60,24,64,19,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
