After years of local Detroit-area success starting in the mid-1960s, Seger achieved his greatest national success starting in the mid-1970s and continuing through the 1980s with the Silver Bullet Band. A roots rocker whose songs deal with blue-collar themes, Seger has recorded many rock and roll hits, including &quot;Night Moves&quot;, &quot;We&amp;#039;ve Got Tonight&quot;, &quot;Like a Rock&quot;, and his iconic signature song &quot;Old Time Rock and Roll&quot;, named one of the Songs of the Century in 2001. Though his last top 40 hit charted in 1991, Seger remains a popular concert draw who continues to perform and record today. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s easy to divine Seger&amp;#039;s influence on the music of Bruce Springsteen, and draw parallels with the vocal style of Van Morrison. The epic themes of Seger&amp;#039;s characters on &quot;Night Moves&quot; certainly parallel those of the folk heroes who populate Springsteen songs (though he began developing his menagerie a good decade before the Boss). The chant-like, testifying cadences of Seger&amp;#039;s blowtorch voice, and his predilection for gospelish motifs, puts one in mind of the mighty Celt&amp;#039;s visionary flights.\n\nAnd as the fine GREATEST HITS makes clear, Bob Seger&amp;#039;s influence on contemporary roots music is enormous. A song such as &quot;Like A Rock&quot; practically defines a roots approach to power pop, while &quot;Old Time Rock &amp; Roll&quot; finds Seger in an upbeat, Little Richard mode. Celebrations notwithstanding, &quot;Still The Same&quot; and &quot;Turn The Page&quot; are dark, unstinting unsentimental looks at the underbelly of the showbiz animal and the road. \n\nCategory Rock, Rock/Pop, Hard Rock\nLabel Capitol / EMI Records \nOrig Year 1994 \nDiscs 1 \nStreet Date Oct 25, 1994 \nStudio/Live Mixed \nMono/Stereo Stereo \n\nTrack Listing\n \n  1.
