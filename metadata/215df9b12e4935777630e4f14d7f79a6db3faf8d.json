She and her twin sister, Wren, ensconced themselves in the Simon Snow series when they were just kids; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what got them through their mother leaving.\n\nReading. Rereading. Hanging out in Simon Snow forums, writing Simon Snow fan fiction, dressing up like the characters for every movie premiere.\n\nCathÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sister has mostly grown away from fandom, but Cath canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let go. She doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to.\n\nNow that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to be roommates. Cath is on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a surly roommate with a charming, always-around boyfriend, a fiction-writing professor who thinks fan fiction is the end of the civilized world, a handsome classmate who only wants to talk about words . . . And she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop worrying about her dad, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s loving and fragile and has never really been alone.\n\nFor Cath, the question is: Can she do this?\n\nCan she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? Writing her own stories?\n\nAnd does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:215df9b12e4935777630e4f14d7f79a6db3faf8d","amp;dn":"Fangirl+-+Rainbow+Rowell+-+2013.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"215df9b12e4935777630e4f14d7f79a6db3faf8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,93,249,177,46,73,53,119,118,48,228,241,77,127,121,166,219,63,175,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
