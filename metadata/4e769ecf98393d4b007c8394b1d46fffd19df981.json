The place was called Birobidzhan. The idea of an autonomous Jewish region was championed by Jewish Communists, Yiddishists, and intellectuals, who envisioned a haven of post-oppression Jewish culture. By the mid-1930s tens of thousands of Soviet Jews, as well as about a thousand Jews from abroad, had moved there. The state-building ended quickly, in the late 1930s, with arrests and purges instigated by Stalin. But after the Second World War, Birobidzhan received another influx of Jewsâ€”those who had been dispossessed by the war. In the late 1940s a second wave of arrests and imprisonments swept through the area, traumatizing BirobidzhanÃ¢Â€â„¢s Jews into silence and effectively shutting down most of the Jewish cultural enterprises that had been created. Where the Jews ArenÃ¢Â€â„¢t is a haunting account of the dream of Birobidzhanâ€”and how it became the cracked and crooked mirror in which we can see the true story of the Jews in twentieth-century Russia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e769ecf98393d4b007c8394b1d46fffd19df981","amp;dn":"Where+the+Jews+Aren%27t+%282016%29+by+Masha+Gessen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e769ecf98393d4b007c8394b1d46fffd19df981","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,118,158,207,152,57,61,75,0,124,131,148,177,212,111,255,209,157,249,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
