Littlefoot flees famine and upheaval to search for the &quot;Great Valley&quot;, an area with lush vegetation which has been spared devastation and where the dinosaurs can thrive and live in peace. During Littlefoot&amp;#039;s journey, he encounters four young companions: Cera, a Triceratops; Ducky, a Parasaurolophus ; Petrie, a Pteranodon; and Spike, a Stegosaurus whom they face several obstacles as they learn to worktogether in order to survive. The film explores issues of prejudice between the different species and the hardships they endure in their journey as they are guided by the spirit of Littlefoot&amp;#039;s mother.\n\nThe film was a critical and financial success and spawned a dozen sequels as well as merchandise and a TV series.\n\nNote - Because this movie is so old there is a lot of noise. I have tried to get rid of much as I could but there is still some left.
