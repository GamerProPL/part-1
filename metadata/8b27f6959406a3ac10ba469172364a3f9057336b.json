These two rips appear to be remastered as they include some bonus tracks... but I'm not sure exactly which version they are although it appears they were both released in 1993 and part of a box set series, according to Wikipedia. The good news is that they shouldn't be brickwalled as this practice was quite rare in the early 90s, at least until the end of the decade when full on mastering butchering started occurring. The rest of the CD's are my own rips, and are not part of a &quot;remastered&quot; series although they were mastered for CD, of course. I bought these discs circa 1993 here in Canada. I have included info on who mastered these as George Marino and Barry Diament both worked on them, I believe at different times as the Zep catalog was released on CD when the format was relatively new. This is a remake of my earlier Zep discography with some improvements within the torrent. Description truncated here at TPB due to size/data limitations.\n\n\nZeppelin is arguably my favourite band of all time, just picked up Mothership &amp; Celebration Day box sets on vinyl and they are amazing to listen to. Looking forward to the Jimmy Page remasters that are supposed to be out in 2014 (first 3 albums to start); here's hoping they come out on vinyl as well. I'm sure they will. Good times be awaiting. \n\n\nKit \n\n\n\n\nPlease help seed these FLACs! \n\n\n\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nLed Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in 1968 by Robert Plant (vocals), Jimmy Page (guitar), John Paul Jones (bass guitar, keyboards, mandolin) and John Bonham (drums). With their heavy, guitar-driven sound, Led Zeppelin are regarded as one of the first heavy metal bands, helping to pioneer the genre.[1][2][3][4][5] However, the band's individualistic style drew from many sources and transcends any one genre.[6] Their rock-infused interpretation of the blues and folk genres[7] also incorporated rockabilly,[8] reggae,[9] soul,[10] funk,[11] classical, Celtic, Indian, Arabic, pop, Latin and country.[12] The band did not release the popular songs from their albums as singles in the UK, as they preferred to develop the concept of &quot;album-oriented rock&quot;.[13][4] They charted ten singles in the US.\n\n\nClose to 30 years after disbanding following Bonham's death in 1980, the band continues to be held in high regard for their artistic achievements, commercial success, and broad influence. The band has sold an estimated 200 million albums worldwide,[14][15][16] including 111.5 million certified units in the United States[17] and they have had all of their original studio albums reach the top 10 of the Billboard album chart in the U.S.,[18] with six reaching the number one spot. Led Zeppelin are ranked #1 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.[19] Rolling Stone magazine has described Led Zeppelin as &quot;the heaviest band of all time&quot;, &quot;the biggest band of the '70s&quot; and &quot;unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history&quot;.[20][5]\n\n\nOn 10 December 2007 the surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited (along with deceased drummer John Bonham's son, Jason) for the Ahmet ErtegÃƒÂ¼n Tribute Concert at The O2 Arena in London.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy some True Rock :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b27f6959406a3ac10ba469172364a3f9057336b","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+Discography+1969+-+1982+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b27f6959406a3ac10ba469172364a3f9057336b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,39,246,149,148,6,163,172,16,186,70,145,114,54,74,63,144,87,51,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
