The film is charged by Hawks stylish snap, a famous set piece or two (Monroe descending that staircase while singing Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend), Russells wit, and songs by Leo Robin and Jule Styne. The film may largely be a fluff project best remembered as a showcase for its leading actresses, but then Monroe and Russell rarely got such extended opportunities to prove that they were more than cinematic icons.\n\nQuincyMKT\npresenting classic hard-to-find movies on bittorent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d0fbb58445732380d954793664c77cd6645f007","amp;dn":"Gentlemen+Prefer+Blondes+%281953%29+%5BDVDRip%2C+FS%2C+Eng%5D+-+QuincyMKT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d0fbb58445732380d954793664c77cd6645f007","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,15,187,88,68,87,50,56,13,149,71,147,102,76,119,205,102,69,240,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
