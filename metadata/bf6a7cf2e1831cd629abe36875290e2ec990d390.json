But when her lying, cheating ex-husband, army colonel Tim Thorp, calls with the news that his three-year-old daughter has been kidnapped, he begs Jamie to come find her. For the sake of the child, Jamie knows she can't refuse. Now, despite the past, she'll do everything in her power to bring little Brooke Thorp home alive.\r\n\r\nSoon Jamie is back at Fort Leedsâ€”the army base in New Jersey's Pine Barrens where she grew up, the only child of a two-star generalâ€”chasing down leads and forging an uneasy alliance with the stern military police commander and the exacting FBI agent working Brooke's case. But because Jamie's father is now a U.S. senator, her recent run-in with a disturbed stalker is all over the news, and when she starts receiving gruesome threats echoing the stalker's last words, she can't shake the feeling that her investigation may be about more than a missing girlâ€”and that someone very powerful is hiding something very significant . . . and very sinister.\r\nPraise for The Kill List","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf6a7cf2e1831cd629abe36875290e2ec990d390","amp;dn":"Nichole+Christoff-The+Kill+List++%5BEpub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf6a7cf2e1831cd629abe36875290e2ec990d390","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,106,124,242,225,131,28,214,41,171,227,104,117,41,14,46,201,144,211,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
