Sons of Liberty Enhanced.\nI included ALUNI_PCVTAPP (Creative ALchemy) to help fix sound/graphics problems if they are present. You need to install this program and add MGS2:S to it to fix certain glitches if they occur.\nOther than that:\n\n1. Install the program as normal -- Choose the FULL INSTALL\n2. Copy the mgs*.exe no-dvd cracked files from the /crack directory over into C:Program Files*KONAMIMetalGearSolid2 Substancebin or wherever you chose to install the game.\n3. Run the game. *cross fingers*\n\n** NOTICE **\n\nThat should work ok, but if you have problems with a black screen or sound glitches, you need to install the Creative ALchemy program and add MGS2:S to it, and then run the game.\nAlso try setting your sound rate to 44khz or whatever it may be on your system.\n\nI only repacked all of these because it was such a hastle to find a working crack for it, and I had the gfx/audio problems initially and had to search comments like crazy. I take no\ncredit for any of the fine work anyone has done in releasing or cracking on this beautiful game. Enjoy!\n\nNote: I was running Windows 7 Premium 64-Bit, 4 cores @ 2.2ghz, 8G Ram, w/ integrated ATI Radeon HD 6530D and everything worked fine after this. Please seed and shoutouts to whomever (leo?) had\nthe previous copy up, but it just wasnt playable as-is. Hope this repack works and my foot isn't in my mouth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- vore","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bb2fac8f19e49292d4534344139e82889fb8a6f","amp;dn":"%5BPC%5D+Metal+Gear+Solid+2+-+Substance+%2F+Sons+of+Liberty+%5BEnhanced%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bb2fac8f19e49292d4534344139e82889fb8a6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,178,250,200,241,158,73,41,45,69,52,52,65,57,232,40,137,251,138,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
