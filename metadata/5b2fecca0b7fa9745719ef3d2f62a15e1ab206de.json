Enjoy and Seed\n\n\n\nWhat is normalization?  (-1db)\n\nThe Normalize effect amplifies the entire file or selection equally. For example, if the original audio reaches a loud peak of 80% and a quiet low of 20%, normalizing to 100% amplifies the loud peak to 100% and the quiet low to 40%.\n\n\n==============================BITRATE TUTORIAL=================================\nBelow I will show you how to easily determine if an mp3 is truely 320 or just a re-encode...\n\nYou will need the torrent listed below to start then follow my steps... &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3883065/Adobe.Audition.v3.WinAll.Cracked-NoPE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3883065/Adobe.Audition.v3.WinAll.Cracked-NoPE&lt;/a&gt;\n\n1.

Click on &quot;View&quot; and then Spectral Frequency Display (Shift+F)\n\n\nA true 320 source will be 20Hz or above..\n\n128 Re-encodes or 192 re-encodes will be stuck @ 16Hz or 18Hz...\n\nHope this clears some things up...\n\n\nNOTE: There is an exception for this rule; oldies,acoustics,piano songs,and low volume music Will have lower frequencies even if encoded with 320!\n=================================================================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b2fecca0b7fa9745719ef3d2f62a15e1ab206de","amp;dn":"MOGWAI+ULTIMATE+DISCOGRAPHY+%28320CBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b2fecca0b7fa9745719ef3d2f62a15e1ab206de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,47,236,202,11,127,169,116,87,25,239,61,47,98,161,94,26,178,6,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
