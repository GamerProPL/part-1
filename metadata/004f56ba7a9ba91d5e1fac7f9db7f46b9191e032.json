Version 5 gives you more\nbrilliant results in less time and with less effort\n\nHighlights\nStep-by-step project assistant\n2D, 3D and cross-section views\nSmart input and construction aids\nIntegrated roof, staircase and environment builders\nRealistic light and shadow simulation\nExtensive object catalog\n\nDo-it-yourself planning and building\n\nAre you planning to build a house? Do you intend to redecorate a\nroom or garden? Become your own architect and plan and design on\nyour very own PC - Ashampoo 3D Architecture 5 makes it possible\n\nEasier and more intuitive with ribbons\n\nYou no longer have to navigate through multiple unrelated\ntoolbars with tiny icons. Ashampoo 3D CAD Architecture 5 groups\nall features logically and thematically as tabbed toolbars\n(ribbon) with meaningful labels. And the new quick-access toolbar\nhosts all recently used features to save you time and nerves\nNaturally, you can always go back to the classic toolbar view, if\nrequired\n\nFaster and future-proof with native 64-bit support\n\nThe new 64-bit version gives you access to all of the available\nmain memory in your PC. This means more space for graphics and\ncomplex calculations on systems with more than 3GB of RAM and\nconsequently quicker access times for smoother workflows. Don't\nknow whether you own a 64-bit system? Ashampoo 3D CAD\nArchitecture 5 automatically selects the version ideal for your\nsystem during installation\n\nMore beautiful and expressive with custom fill patterns and 3D\ntexture displays in 2D\n\nIn previous versions of 3D CAD Architecture, fill patterns were\nentirely based on drawing routines provided by Windows. With\nAshampoo 3D CAD Architecture 5, this limitation is now gone\nCreate your own patterns from lines, circles, curves etc. and use\nthem in your projects. We have already added more than 30 new\npatterns such as reinforced concrete, bricks or parquet flooring\nNow, you can also apply the many 3D textures in 2D and make your\nrooms look even more realistic. Of course, texture rotating and\nscaling is also possible in 2D views\n\nAs real as it gets with realistic light and shadow simulation\n\nHow does your house look at night? In direct sunlight? At night?\nUse the integrated light and shadow simulation to find it out\nGet a real-life picture of your building and also determine\nwhether you've placed those solar elements in their ideal spots\n\nProduct overview\nDesign views: 2D, 3D, Cross-section\n3D constructions: 7 primitives\nExterior lighting simulation\nFreely positionable camera and viewing angles\n\nDesign and construction tools\nRoofing Wizard\nStair Generator\nTopography Designer\nWindow Wizard\n\nFeatures\nSupport for 2D angle dimensioning\nAngle measurements\nMeasurements through polygons\nPhotovoltaic panels\nShadow simulation\nAutomatic area and length calculation\nSupport for area and volume calculation\n\nRequirements:\n\nOperating System:\nWindows XP SP3, Windows Vista , Windows 7, Windows 8\n\nSoftware:\nMicrosoft .Net 4.0 Framework\nVisual Studio 2012 Redistributables\n\nComputer:\n\nProcessor:\n1,8 GHz Single Core Processor or higher\nMulti-core processor recommended for optimized rendering\n\nHarddisk space:\n1,6 GB for installation\n\nMemory:\n4 GB or more\n\nGraphic Card:\nMin. screen resolution 1024 x 768 with true color support\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE:\n\nAs of 09/14/2013 ALL TE RAR archives will now be using the RAR5\nstandard.
