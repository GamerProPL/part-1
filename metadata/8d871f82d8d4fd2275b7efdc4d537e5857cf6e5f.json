With less than two weeks to go until he marries the girl of his dreams (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting), Doug is referred to Jimmy Callahan (Kevin Hart), owner and CEO of Best Man, Inc., a company that provides flattering best men for socially challenged guys in need. What ensues is a hilarious wedding charade as they try to pull off the big con, and an unexpected budding bromance between Doug and his fake best man Jimmy.\n\nDirector: Jeremy Garelick\n\nWriters: Jeremy Garelick, Jay Lavender\n\nActors: Kevin Hart, Josh Gad, Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting, Ken Howard, Cloris Leachman, Jenifer Lewis, Mimi Rogers, Olivia Thirlby\n\nGenre: Comedy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d871f82d8d4fd2275b7efdc4d537e5857cf6e5f","amp;dn":"The+Wedding+Ringer.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%23+%5BHD%5D+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d871f82d8d4fd2275b7efdc4d537e5857cf6e5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,135,31,130,216,212,253,34,117,183,239,220,77,83,126,88,87,207,110,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
