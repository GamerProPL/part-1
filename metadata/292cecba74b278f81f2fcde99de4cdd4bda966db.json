Sullivan - Age of Myth (The Legends of the First Empire #1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince time immemorial, humans have worshipped the gods they call Fhrey, truly a race apart: invincible in battle, masters of magic, and seemingly immortal. But when a god falls to a human blade, the balance of power between men and those they thought were gods changes forever. Now, only a few stand between humankind and annihilation: Raithe, reluctant to embrace his destiny as the God Killer, Suri, a young seer burdened by signs of impending doom, and Persephone, who must overcome personal tragedy to lead her people. The Age of Myth is over; the time of rebellion has begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Tim Gerard Reynolds\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:292cecba74b278f81f2fcde99de4cdd4bda966db","amp;dn":"Michael+J.+Sullivan+-+Age+of+Myth+%28The+Legends+of+the+First+Empi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"292cecba74b278f81f2fcde99de4cdd4bda966db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,44,236,186,116,178,120,248,31,47,205,233,157,228,205,212,189,169,102,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
