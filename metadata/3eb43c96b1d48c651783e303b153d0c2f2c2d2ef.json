While Funkadelic pursued band-format psychedelic rock, Parliament engaged in a funk free-for-all, blending influences from the godfathers (James Brown and Sly Stone) with freaky costumes and themes inspired by '60s acid culture and science fiction. From its 1970 inception until Clinton's dissolving of Parliament in 1980, the band hit the R&amp;B Top Ten several times but truly excelled in two other areas: large-selling, effective album statements and the most dazzling, extravagant live show in the business. In an era when Philly soul continued the slick sounds of establishment-approved R&amp;B, Parliament scared off more white listeners than it courted.\n\nThough it often took a back chair to its sister group Parliament, Funkadelic furthered the notions of black rock begun by Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone, blending elements of '60s psychedelia and blues plus the deep groove of soul and funk. The band pursued album statements of social/political commentary while Parliament stayed in the funk singles format, but Funkadelic nevertheless paralleled the more commercial artist's success, especially in the late '70s when the interplay between bands moved the Funkadelic sound closer to a unified P-Funk style.\n\n\nParliament - Discography 1970-1993 [FLAC]\n\n1970 - Osmium [2002 Remaster]\n1974 - Up for the Down Stroke [2003 Remaster]\n1975 - Chocolate City [2003 Remaster]\n1975 - Mothership Connection [2003 Remaster]\n1976 - The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein\n1977 - Funkentelechy Vs. the Placebo Syndrome\n1977 - Live: P.Funk Earth Tour\n1978 - Motor Booty Affair\n1979 - Gloryhallastoopid (Or Pin the Tail on the Funky)\n1980 - Trombipulation\n1984 - Parliament's Greatest Hits\n1993 - Tear the Roof Off 1974-1980\n\n\nFunkadelic - Discography 1970-2008 [FLAC]\n\n1970 - Funkadelic [2005 Remaster]\n1970 - Free Your Mind... and Your Ass Will Follow [2005 Remaster]\n1971 - Maggot Brain [2005 Remaster]\n1972 - America Eats Its Young [2005 Remaster]\n1973 - Cosmic Slop [2005 Remaster]\n1974 - Standing on the Verge of Getting It On\n1975 - Let's Take It to the Stage\n1976 - Tales of Kidd Funkadelic\n1976 - Hardcore Jollies [2002 Remaster]\n1978 - One Nation Under a Groove [2002 Remaster]\n1979 - Uncle Jam Wants You\n1981 - The Electric Spanking of War Babies\n1996 - Live - Meadowbrook, Rochester, Michigan - 12th September 1971\n2003 - Motor City Madness: The Ultimate Funkadelic Westbound Compilation\n2008 - Toys\n\n\nAlbum artwork and rip logs are included.
