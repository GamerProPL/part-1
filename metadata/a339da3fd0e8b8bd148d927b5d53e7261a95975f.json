The 1960 album is the first that introduced John Coltrane's legendary quartet with pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Steve Davis, and drummer Elvin Jones. It is also the first on which he played soprano saxophone. And it absolutely reimagined how a popular song (the smash title track) could be interpreted and spun into a completely new, absorbingly beautiful piece of art.\n\nInitially, the idea behind My Favorite Things was to have Coltrane record a set of standards that would be welcomed by the populace and marketplace. The genesis was Coltrane's preceding The Avant-Garde album, which, true to its title, found the leader exploring angular works. However, Coltrane didn't settle for a typical approach here, as his radical redoing of the title track features a scalar technique, a hybrid of Western and Eastern themes, advanced chord structures and yet, recognizable shapes and controlled melodies throughout. It remains a marvel of modern music, its freshness immune to age.\n\nThe remainder of the album is equally splendid, with Coltrane riffing on two George Gershwin tunes and displaying a trademark coolness that defined his work for Atlantic. His mates are sympathetic to the cause, the band's chemistry simply superb. This is truly a record that no music lover should be without.\n\n\nCD / 2004 / Atlantic Masters / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n1 My Favorite Things \t \n2 Everytime We Say Goodbye \t \n3 Summertime  \t \n4 But Not For Me\n \t \nBonus Tracks\n5 My Favorite Things, Part 1 (Single Version)\t \n6 My Favorite Things, Part 2 (Single Version) \t\n\n\nPersonnel:\nSoprano Saxophone, John Coltrane (tracks: 1, 2, 5, 6) \nTenor Saxophone, John Coltrane (tracks: 3, 4) \nPiano, McCoy Tyner\nBass, Steve Davis\nDrums, Elvin Jones\n\n\nMy Favorite Things was recorded October 21, 1960\nSummertime was recorded October 24, 1960\nEverytime We Say Goodbye and But Not For Me were recorded October 26, 1960 at Atlantic Studios, New York City\n\n\nOriginal album released as Atlantic SD-1361, March 196\n1\nTrack 5 (bonus track) released as Atlantic single #5012-A, 1961 \nTrack 6 (bonus track) released as Atlantic single #5012-B, 1961\n\n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n\n\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a339da3fd0e8b8bd148d927b5d53e7261a95975f","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+My+Favorite+Things+1961+%2F+2004","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a339da3fd0e8b8bd148d927b5d53e7261a95975f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,57,218,63,208,232,184,189,20,141,146,123,93,83,231,38,26,149,151,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
