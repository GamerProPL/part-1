Then they used their minds to change their brains in ways that changed history.\n\nWith the new breakthroughs in neuroscience, combined with the insights from thousands of years of contemplative practice, you, too, can shape your own brain for greater happiness, love, and wisdom.\nBuddha's Brain joins the forces of modern science with ancient teachings to show readers how to have greater emotional balance in turbulent times, as well as healthier relationships, more effective actions, and a deeper religious or spiritual practice.\nWell-referenced and grounded in science, the book is full of practical tools and skills readers can use in daily life to tap the unused potential of the brain and rewire it over time for greater peace and well-being.\nIf you can change your brain, you can change your life.\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\n\nvisit me on facebook -  Google &quot;TEAM NANBAN TPB&quot;\n\n\nTO JOIN TMRG ON FACEBOOK\nTMRG IS TORRENT MAFIA RELEASE GROUP","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:206cbe81f99f983d44f9769e851f7e6e9317e40b","amp;dn":"Buddha%27s+Brain-+The+Practical+Neuroscience+of+Happiness%2C+Love%2C+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"206cbe81f99f983d44f9769e851f7e6e9317e40b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,108,190,129,249,159,152,61,68,249,118,158,133,31,126,110,147,23,228,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
