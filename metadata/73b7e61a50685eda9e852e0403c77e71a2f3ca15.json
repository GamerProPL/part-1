It's all aboveboard, but &quot;politics is perception&quot; and sparks fly anyway.\n\nDirected by Rob Reiner. \n\nStarring Michael Douglas, Annette Bening. \n\nNOTE: Movie I watched long ago. Recommended. Most people avoided in theaters expecting some political blabbering. It's not, it is very good involving romantic movie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73b7e61a50685eda9e852e0403c77e71a2f3ca15","amp;dn":"The.American.President.1995.BluRay.720p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73b7e61a50685eda9e852e0403c77e71a2f3ca15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,183,230,26,80,104,94,218,158,133,46,4,3,199,126,113,162,243,202,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
