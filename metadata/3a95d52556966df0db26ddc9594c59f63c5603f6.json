They form a team and participate in a national level competition where they are disqualified as their moves match the original moves and everyone call them cheaters. Everyone departs to search for jobs. Suresh works in a bar as waiter and Vinnie joins a beauty parlour where they are both insulted as cheaters. Suresh plans to remove the negative tag by winning the hip-hop competition in Las Vegas. One day he watches Vishnu (Prabhudeva) dance in the bar and convinces him to be their choreographer. They audition for people and collect the team. They participate in the qualifiers in Bangalore and win it. Later they go to Las Vegas, but it is revealed that Vishnu has ulterior motives to go to Vegas. In Las Vegas they win qualifiers. Later Vishnu leaves the hotel with the money to meet his son. His son's mother is married to another man and has moved on in life. He talks to his child and leaves. He comes back later and they enter the final. In the meantime, Vinnie gets injured and is replaced by Olive (Lauren Gottlieb). She becomes close with Suresh and a jealous Vinnie tells Suresh that she loves him. The team enters the final, where they make a mistake in the formation and fall down. They don't give up and come back and do the formation once again. They ultimately lose the competition but they have won the hearts of millions.\n\nUploader's Notes:\n\nThe first HEVC rip from a pDVD source obtained by DDR. The source was good and the rip does it justice. We have adjusted the luminance values and the oversaturation to enhance your viewing pleasure. The HEVC encoding allows a much better quality in a small 700 MB size (It is a 2Ã‚Â½ hour movie).\n\nTill you get a DVD SCR from DDR, this would be the rip to watch.\n\nBe aware that this rip (and all HEVC rips) will not play on any stand-alone device. You can only watch this on a computer. Be sure that you have these or later versions of VLC or Media Player Classic. Earlier versions may not work:\nVLC - 2.1.5 (Rincewind).\nMPC - 1.7.8 (6fcba 1b)\n\nIMDB Link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3679000/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3679000/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSample (2 minutes): Download from here\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/nGK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/nGK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/nGJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/nGJ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/nGZ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/nGZ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/nGe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/nGe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/nGB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/nGB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/nGC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/nGC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/nG4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/nG4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/nGY&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/nGY&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a95d52556966df0db26ddc9594c59f63c5603f6","amp;dn":"Anybody+Can+Dance+2+%282015%29+-+pDVD.rip+-+HEVC+-+x265.AAC+-DDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a95d52556966df0db26ddc9594c59f63c5603f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,149,213,37,86,150,109,240,219,38,221,201,89,76,89,246,60,86,3,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
