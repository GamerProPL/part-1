But Monk's strongest suit on this set is his &quot;third hand,&quot; John Coltrane. The material, two 25-minute, five-tune sets in great fidelity and the quartet in unbelievable form, includes Monk classics like &quot;Epistrophy,&quot; &quot;Monk's Moods,&quot; and &quot;Evidence,&quot; as well as a striking rendition of the standard &quot;Sweet and Lovely.&quot; \nThis is music that not only bears repeated listenings, but also demands them - the ultimate definition of a classic.\n\n\nThelonious Monk Quartet with John Coltrane\n\nAt Carnegie Hall\n\n1957\n\n  \n  CD / 2005 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\n- Tracklist / Early Show:\n\nMonk's Mood\n\nEvidence\n\nCrepuscule With Nellie\n\nNutty\n\nEpistrophy\n\n- Tracklist / Late Show:\n\nBye-Ya\n\nSweet And Lovely\n\nBlue Monk\n\nEpistrophy (Incomplete)\t\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nThelonious Monk Ã¢â‚¬â€œ piano\n\nJohn Coltrane Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tenor saxophone\n\nAhmed Abdul-Malik Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\n\nShadow Wilson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n\n\nThelonious Monk Quartet with John Coltrane at Carnegie Hall 1957","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:455276ce24778d705afa8fd32f37974e030e343a","amp;dn":"Thelonious+Monk+with+John+Coltrane+at+Carnegie+Hall+%281957%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"455276ce24778d705afa8fd32f37974e030e343a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,82,118,206,36,119,141,112,90,250,143,211,47,55,151,78,3,14,52,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
