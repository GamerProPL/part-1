I didnÃ‚Â´t recognize any strange behaviours or processes.\n \nVirustotal report: https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/58545d9e7bb28d1412d9fbf9fab3477f04d96cb27c8ad38bf92c960e1e5e0e13/analysis/1400974959/\n \nIn My opinion, thatÃ‚Â´s a very typical &quot;false positive&quot; from patches. I say itÃ‚Â´s clean.\nHowever, the choice and responsibility is always Yours. You choose if You use the patch.\n \n \nThis is My personal choice of PDF softwares. Much more lightweight and less crap, than in Adobe. I really recommend Foxit.\n \n \n \nIf You like this upload, please share it with others by seeding.
