While she's posted to Iraq, the earnest Stan is home in Minnesota with their daughters, Heidi, 12, and Dawn, 8. He manages a home supply store. After morning visitors bring Stan news, he takes the girls for a car ride that turns into a spontaneous trip to Dawn's favorite place, a Florida amusement park. On the way, they stop at Stan's mother's house, where his brother is staying. Heidi is an insomniac, who tries to fathom her father's uncharacteristic behavior. Dawn is cheerfully unreflective. They have fun at the park. Stan summons his courage. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6703005f5c2babe95ee3c219d7c8f087c89a913a","amp;dn":"Grace+Is+Gone+%282007%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6703005f5c2babe95ee3c219d7c8f087c89a913a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,3,0,95,92,43,171,233,94,227,194,25,215,200,240,135,200,154,145,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
