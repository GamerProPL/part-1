Sandman sang distinctively in a &quot;deep, laid-back croon&quot;, and his songwriting featured a prominent beat influence. The band themselves coined the label &quot;low rock&quot; to describe their music, which involved &quot;a minimalist, low-end sound that could have easily become a gimmick: a 'power trio' not built around the sound of an electric guitar. Instead, with sly intelligence, Morphine expanded its offbeat vocabulary on each album.&quot; (From Wikipedia)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7882c994940f2c2acd88596fb0f078b3ad42b351","amp;dn":"Morphine+-+Studio.Discography+%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7882c994940f2c2acd88596fb0f078b3ad42b351","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,130,201,148,148,15,44,42,205,136,89,111,176,240,120,179,173,66,179,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
