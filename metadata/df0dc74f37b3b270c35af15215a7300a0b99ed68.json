He is best known as the lead guitarist, lead singer, and songwriter for the rock band Dire Straits, which he co-founded with his brother, David Knopfler, in 1977.\n\nSince Dire Straits disbanded in 1995, Knopfler has recorded and produced seven solo albums, and, as with his previous band, produced many hit songs. He has composed and produced film scores for eight films, including Local Hero (1983), Cal (1984), The Princess Bride (1987), and Wag the Dog (1997).\n\nIn addition to his work with Dire Straits and as a solo artist and composer, Knopfler has recorded and performed with many prominent musicians, including Chet Atkins, Chris Botti, The Chieftains, Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Bryan Ferry, Emmylou Harris, Jools Holland, Sonny Landreth, Van Morrison, Steely Dan, Sting, and James Taylor, sometimes working as a session musician. He has produced albums for Tina Turner, Bob Dylan, and Randy Newman.\n\nKnopfler is a fingerstyle guitarist and was ranked 27th on Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. Knopfler and Dire Straits have sold in excess of 120 million albums to date. A four-time Grammy Award winner, Knopfler is the recipient of the Edison Award, the Steiger Award and the Ivor Novello Award, as well as holding three honorary doctorate degrees in music from universities in the United Kingdom.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracker is the eighth solo album by British singer-songwriter and guitarist Mark Knopfler, scheduled to be released on 16 March 2015 (17 March 2015 in North America).\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMusicians:\n\nMark Knopfler: vocals, guitars\nGuy Fletcher: keyboards, vocals\nBruce Molsky \nJohn McCusker \nMike McGoldrick \nPhil Cunningham: accordion\nGlenn Worf: bass\nIan Thomas: drums\nNigel Hitchcock: saxophone\nTom Walsh: trumpet\nRuth Moody: vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df0dc74f37b3b270c35af15215a7300a0b99ed68","amp;dn":"Mark+Knopfler+-+Tracker+%5B2+CD%27s%5D%5B2015%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BDeluxe+Edition%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df0dc74f37b3b270c35af15215a7300a0b99ed68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,13,199,79,55,179,178,112,195,90,241,82,21,167,48,10,11,153,237,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
