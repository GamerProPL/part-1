Use your favorite burning program to create your disc. If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have one, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d recommend ImgBurn as simple and easy to use.\n\nIf you want the files on your computer and arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sure how to get them there without burning the DVD first, look up Daemon tools. This can be used to mount the iso file as a virtual drive on your computer, from which you can rip and convert as normal. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f531700c729985e81b47c06f78937216d26a525b","amp;dn":"Insanity+disc+2+Plyometric+Cardio+Circuit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f531700c729985e81b47c06f78937216d26a525b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,49,112,12,114,153,133,232,27,71,192,111,120,147,114,22,210,106,82,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
