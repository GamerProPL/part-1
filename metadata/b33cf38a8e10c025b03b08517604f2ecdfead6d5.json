That's the question Clementine can't stop asking herself.\r\nIt was just a backyard barbeque. They didn't know their hosts that well. They were friends of friends. They could so easily have said no. But she and her husband, Sam, said yes, and now they can never change what they did and didn't do that beautiful winter's day.\r\n\r\nSix responsible adults. Three cute kids. One yapping dog. It's a normal weekend in the suburbs. What could possibly go wrong?\r\n \nhttp://www.audible.com.au/pd/Crime-Thrillers/Truly-Madly-Guilty-Audiobook/B01H0LCHVQ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b33cf38a8e10c025b03b08517604f2ecdfead6d5","amp;dn":"Truly+Madly+Guilty+-+Liane+Moriarty+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b33cf38a8e10c025b03b08517604f2ecdfead6d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,60,243,138,142,16,192,37,176,59,8,81,118,4,242,236,223,234,214,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
