But beware of excessive choice: choice overload can make you question the decisions you make before you even make them, it can set you up for unrealistically high expectations, and it can make you blame yourself for any and all failures. In the long run, this can lead to decision-making paralysis, anxiety, and perpetual stress. And, in a culture that tells us that there is no excuse for falling short of perfection when your options are limitless, too much choice can lead to clinical depression.\r\n\r\nIn The Paradox of Choice, Barry Schwartz explains at what point choice - the hallmark of individual freedom and self-determination that we so cherish - becomes detrimental to our psychological and emotional well-being. In accessible, engaging, and anecdotal prose, Schwartz shows how the dramatic explosion in choiceâ€“from the mundane to the profound challenges of balancing career, family, and individual needsâ€“has paradoxically become a problem instead of a solution. Schwartz also shows how our obsession with choice encourages us to seek that which makes us feel worse","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e42b00e2c595d2f25d420884508804975e10fd44","amp;dn":"The+Paradox+of+Choice+%5BAudiobook+%2B+ePub%5D+by+Barry+Schwartz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e42b00e2c595d2f25d420884508804975e10fd44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,43,0,226,197,149,210,242,93,66,8,132,80,136,4,151,94,16,253,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
