I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep.\n\nYou may have heard of me.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09107eab84ac825f76797988259f138d543fdef2","amp;dn":"Patrick+Rothfuss+-+The+Name+of+the+Wind+-+unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09107eab84ac825f76797988259f138d543fdef2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,16,126,171,132,172,130,95,118,121,121,136,37,159,19,141,84,63,222,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
