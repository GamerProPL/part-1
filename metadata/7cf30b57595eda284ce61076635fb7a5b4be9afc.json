After reading this book, functional managers will bolster their awareness of what good metrics management really entailsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and be armed with the knowledge to measure performance more effectively.\n\nThis book begins with basic KPI principles, helping functional managers deal with such key issues as:\n\nSuccessfully integrating KPIs and metrics into managing a project within a business strategy\n\nImportant business dashboard techniques used in monitoring performance\n\nWhat is really important to different stakeholders in a project\n\nManaging resistance to change\n\nNext the book explores the key questions to ask before implementing a dashboard or reporting system. Some of these questions include:\n\nWhat are your needs?\n\nWhat is involved in integration?\n\nWhat's involved in operations and maintenance?\n\nWhat does the system cost?\n\nHow long will the system last?\n\nThroughout the book, helpful illustrations clarify complex concepts and processes.
