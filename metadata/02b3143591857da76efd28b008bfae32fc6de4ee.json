For those who don't...\nCome and taste... :)\n\nThere are 17 albums and 8 singles, including side projects of members of the band\nThe sampling rate is 320kbps when possible. Different rates are signed in the name of the albums folders. Enjoy :)\n\n\nAlbum List:\n\nAsian Dub Foundation LPs\n\n\t1995 - Facts And Fiction\n\t1997 - R.A.F.I\n\t1998 - Conscious Party\n\t1998 - Rafi's Revenge\n\t2000 - Community Music\n\t2001 - Frontline 1993-1997 (rareities and remixes)\n\t2003 - Enemy Of The Enemy\n\t2003 - Keep Banging On The Walls (Live)\n\t2005 - Tank\n\t2007 - Time Freeze (The Best Of 1995-2007)\n\t2008 - Punkara\n\t2011 - A History Of Now\n\n\nAsian Dub Foundation Singles\n\n\t1997 - Naxalite\n\t1998 - Black White\n\t1998 - Buzzin'\n\t1998 - Free Satpal Ram\n\t2000 - New Way, New Life\n\t2001 - Real Great Britain\n\t2002 - Fortress Europe\n\t2003 - 1000 Mirrors\n     \n\nDeeder Zaman\n\n\t2008 - Minority Large - 192\n        \n\nDr. Das\n\n\t2005 - Visionary Underground - Keep the Grime On\n\t2006 - Emergency Basslines - VBR\n\n\nGhetto Priest\n\n\t2003 - Vulture Culture - 192\n\t2006 - Beyond Flesh        \n\n\n(browse all my torrents:\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\nfor private posts:\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&lt;/a&gt;\n)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02b3143591857da76efd28b008bfae32fc6de4ee","amp;dn":"Asian+Dub+Foundation+discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02b3143591857da76efd28b008bfae32fc6de4ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,179,20,53,145,133,125,167,110,253,40,176,8,191,174,50,252,109,228,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
