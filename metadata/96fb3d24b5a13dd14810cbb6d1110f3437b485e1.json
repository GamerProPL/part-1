His voice was noted for its exciting upper register, and tailor-made for the operas of Verdi, Bellini, Donizetti, and Puccini, and as it darkened slightly over the years, for the verismo composers as well. His vocal longevity, which kept him singing youthfully well into his sixties, and still beautifully after that, was a credit to his commanding technique and artistry, and remarkable considering his nearly 40 years of performing. \n\n\nGenre................: Opera\nYear.................: 2013\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Cue, Audiochecker\n\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Nessun Dorma\n02.Che Gelida Manina (Your Tiny Hand Is Frozen)\n03.Questa O Quella\n04.Parmi Veder Le Lagrime\n05.La Donna ÃƒË† Mobile\n06.Una Furtiva Lagrima\n07.La Fleur Que Tu M'avais Jetee\n08.Au Fond Du Temple Saint (Pearl Fishers' Duet)\n09.Vesti La Giubba\n10.Recondita Armonia\n11.E Lucevan Le Stelle\n12.Di Quella Pira\n13.Celeste Aida\n14.O Soave Fanciulla\n15.Tra Voi, Belle\n16.Donna Non Vidi Mai\n17.Ch'ella Mi Creda\n18.Amor Ti Vieta\n19.O Paradiso\n20.M'appari\n21.Ave Maria\n22.O Holy Night\n23.Ingemisco\n24.Brindisi\n25.Nessun Dorma (Original Three Tenors Version)\n26.Che Gelida Manina (1961 First Known Pavarotti Recording)\n\n\nCD2\n\n01.'O Sole Mio\n02.Funiculi Funicula\n03.Torna A Surriento\n04.Mattinata\n05.Nel Blu, Dipinto Di Blu (Volare)\n06.La Mia Canzone Al Vento\n07.Mamma\n08.Santa Lucia\n09.Non To Scordar Di Me\n10.Caro Mio Ben\n11.La Danza\n12.Malinconia\n13.Ma Rendi Pur Contento\n14.La Serenata\n15.Caruso\n16.Il Canto\n17.Buongiorno A Te\n18.Granada\n19.Tu Che M'hai Preso Il Cuor (Dein Ist Mein Ganzes Herz/You Are My Heart's Delight)\n20.Panis Angelicus (With Sting)\n21.Holy Mother (With Eric Clapton)\n22.Peace Wanted Just To Be Free (With Stevie Wonder)\n23.Miss Sarajevo (With Brian Eno, Bono &amp; The Edge)\n24.My Way (With Frank Sinatra)\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96fb3d24b5a13dd14810cbb6d1110f3437b485e1","amp;dn":"Luciano+Pavarotti+-+The+50+Greatest+Tracks+%282013%29+%7BFLAC%7D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96fb3d24b5a13dd14810cbb6d1110f3437b485e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,251,61,36,181,161,61,209,72,16,203,182,209,17,15,52,55,180,133,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
