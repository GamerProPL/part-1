While Atlanta and Houston artists were establishing their cities as Southern strongholds, Ross aimed at putting Miami back in rap's national spotlight. Ross, real name William Roberts, grew up in Carol City, Florida, an impoverished northern suburb of Miami. Influenced by artists like Luther Campbell and the Notorious B.I.G., Roberts formed local rap group the Carol City Cartel and began rapping in the mid-'90s. (He took his rap name from Los Angeles drug kingpin &quot;Freeway&quot; Rick Ross, who ran one of the largest crack cocaine distribution networks in the country during the '80s and early '90s.) Ross had a brief stint on Suave House Records, former label of Eightball &amp; MJG, before he ended up on Miami-based Slip 'N' Slide Records, the label home of Trick Daddy and Trina. During the early to mid-2000s, he became popular and well known locally through touring with Trick Daddy and guest-appearing on a few Slip 'N' Slide releases, but didn't release any solo material until 2006. \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          DiSCOGRAPHY\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPort Of Miami (2006)\nTrilla (Bonus Track Version) (2008)\nDeeper Than Rap (Deluxe Version) (2009)\nCustom Cars &amp; Cycles (2009)\nAttention Deficit (Bonus Track Version) (2009)\nTrilla (Bonus Track Version) (2010)\nMMG Presents: Self Made, Vol. 1 (2011)\nAmbition (Deluxe Version) (2011)\nLincoln Way Nights (Deluxe Version) (2011)\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                            SETTiNGS\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist: Rick Ross | Wale | Stalley | Triple C's\nLabel: Warner Bros.
