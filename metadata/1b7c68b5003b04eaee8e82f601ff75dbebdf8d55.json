Then renderd the first sharpen, then \r\nnoise reduction and then did a final sharpen\r\n\r\nalso adjusted my previous releases edit after i did the sync and missing parts so that it didnt sound so tinny.\r\n\r\nLondon Has Fallen is on its way.\r\n\r\nSCREENS\r\n \nhttp://boltimg.com/image/1ClF \nhttp://boltimg.com/image/1Khb \nhttp://boltimg.com/image/1gBN \nhttp://boltimg.com/image/1wF7 \nhttp://boltimg.com/image/14Tf \nhttp://boltimg.com/image/1Q2O","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b7c68b5003b04eaee8e82f601ff75dbebdf8d55","amp;dn":"Deadpool+2016+HD-TS+1080p+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b7c68b5003b04eaee8e82f601ff75dbebdf8d55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,124,104,181,0,59,4,234,238,142,130,246,1,255,117,219,235,223,141,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
