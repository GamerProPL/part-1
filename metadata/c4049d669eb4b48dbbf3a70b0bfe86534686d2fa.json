It does not hide bad sectors, it really restores them! Hard disk \ndrive is an integral part of every computer. It stores all your information. \nOne of the most prevalent defects of hard drives is bad sectors on the disk \nsurface. Bad sectors are a part of the disk surface which contains not readable, \nbut frequently necessary information. As a result of bad sectors you may have \ndifficulties to read and copy data from your disk, your operating system becomes \nunstable and finally your computer may unable to boot altogether. When a hard \ndrive is damaged with bad sectors, the disk not only becomes unfit for use, but \nalso you risk losing information stored on it. The HDD Regenerator can repair \ndamaged hard disks without affecting or changing existing data. As a result, \npreviously unreadable and inaccessible information is restored.\n\n\nMain benefits\nHard disk drive is an integral part of every computer. It stores all your \ninformation. One of the most prevalent defects of hard drives is bad sectors on \nthe disk surface. Bad sectors are a part of the disk surface which contains not \nreadable, but frequently necessary information. As a result of bad sectors you \nmay have difficulties to read and copy data from your disk, your operating system \nbecomes unstable and finally your computer may unable to boot altogether. When a \nhard drive is damaged with bad sectors, the disk not only becomes unfit for use, \nbut also you risk losing information stored on it. The HDD Regenerator can repair \ndamaged hard disks without affecting or changing existing data. As a result, \npreviously unreadable and inaccessible information is restored.  \n\nHow it works\nAlmost 60% of all hard drives damaged with bad sectors have an incorrectly \nmagnetized disk surface. We have developed an algorithm which is used to repair \ndamaged disk surfaces. This technology is hardware independent, it supports many \ntypes of hard drives and repairs damage that even low-level disk formatting cannot\nrepair. As a result, previously unreadable information will be restored. Because \nof the way the repair is made, the existing information on the disk drive will not \nbe affected!\n\nCan the HDD Regenerator repair your drive?\nAlmost 60 % of damaged hard disks can be repaired by regeneration. You can always \ndownload free demo version and try to regenerate the first found bad sector. \nThe main purpose of the unregistered demo version is to display a report which \ncontains information about the possibility to regenerate the entire disk by means \nof the registered full version. If the first found bad sector has been \nsuccessfully regenerated, you can buy the product to regenerate all bad sectors \non your hard drive. If the first bad sector has NOT been successfully regenerated,\nthen replace your hard disk drive as soon as possible.\n\nImportant notes\nSince the program does not change the logical structure of a hard drive, the \nfile system may still show some sectors marked earlier as 'bad', and other disk \nutilities such as Scandisk will detect logical bad sectors even though the disk \nhas been successfully regenerated and is no longer damaged by physical bad \nsectors. If you want to remove these marks, repartition the hard disk drive.\n\n\nFeatures:\n* Ability to detect physical bad sectors on a hard disk drive surface.\n* Ability to repair physical bad sectors(magnetic errors) on a hard disk surface.\n* The product ignores file system, scans disk at physical level. It can be used \n  with FAT,NTFS or any other file system, and also with unformatted.\n\n\n/Ubehage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4049d669eb4b48dbbf3a70b0bfe86534686d2fa","amp;dn":"HDD+Regenerator+1.71+Pro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4049d669eb4b48dbbf3a70b0bfe86534686d2fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,4,157,102,158,180,180,141,187,243,167,11,11,254,134,83,70,134,210,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
