Photographer and teacher Ben Long shows how to balance the three key parameters that dictate how your camera records light: aperture, ISO, and shutter speed. He'll review exactly what &quot;good&quot; exposure means and where dynamic range comes into play, and explain how you can manipulate exposure using in-camera aids such as Auto ISO and metering modes, and with post-processing software like Photoshop. These techniques will help you understand how your camera &quot;sees&quot; and give you more technical and creative options when shooting","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e91cb9d95433362f8b09ed30a1865090e232afca","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Exploring+Photography%3A+Exposure+and+Dynamic+Range","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e91cb9d95433362f8b09ed30a1865090e232afca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,28,185,217,84,51,54,47,139,9,237,48,161,134,80,144,226,50,175,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
