Yet, as AndrÃ©s ResÃ©ndez illuminates in his myth-shattering The Other Slavery, it was practiced for centuries as an open secret. There was no abolitionist movement to protect the tens of thousands of natives who were kidnapped and enslaved by the conquistadors, then forced to descend into the â€œmouth of hellâ€ of eighteenth-century silver mines or, later, made to serve as domestics for Mormon settlers and rich Anglos.\r\n\r\nResÃ©ndez builds the incisive case that it was mass slavery, more than epidemics, that decimated Indian populations across North America. New evidence, including testimonies of courageous priests, rapacious merchants, Indian captives, and Anglo colonists, sheds light too on Indian enslavement of other Indians â€” as what started as a European business passed into the hands of indigenous operators and spread like wildfire across vast tracts of the American Southwest.\r\n\r\nThe Other Slavery reveals nothing less than a key missing piece of American history. For over two centuries we have fought over, abolished, and tried to come to grips with African-American slavery. It is time for the West to confront an entirely separate, equally devastating enslavement we have long failed truly to see","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:707d8017f8179ab6b3fce82dd5f8b8f7080d694b","amp;dn":"The+Other+Slavery%3A+The+Uncovered+Story+of+Indian+Enslavement+in+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"707d8017f8179ab6b3fce82dd5f8b8f7080d694b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,125,128,23,248,23,154,182,179,252,232,45,213,248,184,247,8,13,105,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
