The band comprised David Byrne (lead vocals and guitar), Chris Frantz (drums and backing vocals), Tina Weymouth (bass and backing vocals) and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar, and backing vocals). Auxiliary musicians also regularly made appearances in concert and on the group's albums. The New Wave style of Talking Heads combined elements of punk, art rock, avant-garde, pop, funk, world music, and Americana. Frontman and songwriter David Byrne contributed whimsical, esoteric lyrics to the band's songs, and emphasized their showmanship through various multimedia projects and performances.\nCritic Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes Talking Heads as being &quot;one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s, while managing to earn several pop hits.&quot; In 2002, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Four of the band's albums appeared on Rolling Stone magazine's 2003 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and the Channel 4 100 Greatest Albums poll listed one album (Fear of Music) at number 76. On a 2011 update of Rolling Stone's &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;, the band was ranked at No. 100\n\nCountry: USA\nGenre: New Wave / post-punk / dance-rock / art punk / experimental rock / funk / pop rock\nQuality: 320 kbps\nAlbum List:\n\n(1977) Talking Heads - Talking Heads 77\n(1978) Talking Heads - More Songs About Buildings and Food\n(1979) Talking Heads - Fear Of Music\n(1980) Talking Heads - Remain in Light\n(1983) Talking Heads - Speaking in Tongues\n(1985) Talking Heads - Little Creatures\n(1986) Talking Heads - True Stories\n(1988) Talking Heads - Naked\n@320 kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2012896c91519c89b7ff9c3022e7782e56d4256e","amp;dn":"Talking+Heads+Studio+Albuns+%40320+kbps+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2012896c91519c89b7ff9c3022e7782e56d4256e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,18,137,108,145,81,156,137,183,255,156,48,34,231,120,46,86,212,37,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
