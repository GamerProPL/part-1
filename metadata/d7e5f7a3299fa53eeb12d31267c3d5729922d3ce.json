Digitally remastered from the original master tapes, road-trip classics like &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads,&quot; &quot;Rocky Mountain High,&quot; and &quot;Back Home Again&quot; are as warm as the singer's lauded tenor. There are no gimmicky re-recorded cuts or disappointing live tracks -- &quot;Thank God I'm a Country Boy&quot; spent its time on the charts in its live incarnation -- and his spotty '80s material is only briefly covered (&quot;Perhaps Love&quot; and &quot;Shanghai Breezes&quot;). For those unwilling to sift through the exhaustive four-CD Country Roads Collection, Song's Best Friend: The Very Best of John Denver is a good buy and a rewarding visit with an old friend.\nAll Music Review by James Christopher Monger\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Leaving On A Jet Plane\n[02] Take Me Home Country Roads\n[03] Sunshine On My Shoulders\n[04] Poems, Prayers And Promises\n[05] The Eagle And The Hawk\n[06] Rocky Mountain High\n[07] Farewall Andromeda (Welcome To My Morning)\n[08] Annie's Song\n[09] Back Home Again\n[10] Sweet Surrender\n[11] Thank God I'm A Country Boy\n[12] I'm Sorry\n[13] Calypso\n[14] Fly Away\n[15] Looking For Space\n[16] Like A Sad Song\n[17] My Sweet Lady\n[18] Perhaps Love - - - PlÃƒÂ¡cido Domingo &amp; John Denver\n[19] Shanghai Breezes\n[20] Wild Montana Skies - - - John Denver &amp; Emylou Harris\n\nPlay Time - 01h:17m:55s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Leaving, On A Jet Plane (Babe, I Hate To Go) [Previously Unreleased On CD]\n[02] The Weight [Previously Unreleased]\n[03] Annie's Song [Previously Unreleased Accoustic Mix]\n[04] Calypso [Previously Unreleased Accoustic Mix]\n[05] Amsterdam [Live At London Palladium]\n\nPlay Time - 00h:18m:25s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 01h:36m:20s\nTotal File Size....................... 247mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
