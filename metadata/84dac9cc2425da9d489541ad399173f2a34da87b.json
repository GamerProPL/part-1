CATIA provides powerful  |*|\n|*| tools for 2D sketching and 3D modelling, extensive support for mold design and  |*|\n|*| machining, and even the possibility of innovation-driven design with product    |*|\n|*| analysis and failure prediction tools. Mechanical Design Suite provides products|*|\n|*| for intuitive specification driven modeling for Solid, Hybrid and Sheetmetal    |*|\n|*| Part design, Assembly design and integrated Drafting.The new Light Manufacturing|*| \n|*| Part Generation product notably enhances productivity and collaboration by      |*|\n|*| allowing users to work concurrently on the same composite part, later merging   |*|\n|*| and synchronizing separately designed stacks into a single manufactured         |*|\n|*| composite part. A new grid-based design methodology automatically generates     |*|\n|*| plies by taking each cellGÃƒÂ¤Ã‚Â¾Ã‚Âµs composite specifications defined during             |*|\n|*| simulation and applying composite design best\n practices.                                     \n\n\n                     Install Notes\n                                  \n1.
