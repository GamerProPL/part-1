With his solo career stalling just as the boyband he'd left for dead a decade earlier reclaimed their place asbiggest pop act, it didn't take a cynic to predict where the reversal of fortunes would lead.\n\nThe issue was never would Robbie return, but what they would do with him when he did. Was there really room in the cosily reformed group for a dysfunctional egomaniac? Could he ever play nicely as part of a band again? It may be a reunion, but the story of Take That's third post-comeback album, their first as a five piece since 1995, is, inevitably, all about Robbie Williams.\n\nTracklist:\n\n   1. The Flood\n   2. SOS\n   3. Wait\n   4. Kidz\n   5. Pretty Things\n   6. Happy Now\n   7. Underground Machine\n   8. What Do You Want From Me?\n   9. Affirmation\n  10. Eight Letters\n\n\nSeed and enjoy folks!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c261ce3eba7e3c96af68b3de543946bc74e610b","amp;dn":"Take+That+-+Progress+%282010%29+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c261ce3eba7e3c96af68b3de543946bc74e610b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,38,28,227,235,167,227,201,106,246,139,61,229,67,148,107,199,78,97,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
