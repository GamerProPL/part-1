Not only has the lyrical and romantic Ã¢â‚¬Å“YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ been one of the most popular tracks of the festival season, the track has also been receiving lots of attention from other djs and producers wanting to put their own spin on the beautiful melody. Safe to say, the crowd favorite during Ultra Miami was definitely Still YoungÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remix (supported by Steve Angello), which you can listen here, but now it will face some stiff competition from the legend, Tiesto, and TwoloudÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remix. Tiesto and TwoloudÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remix kept the melodic foundations of the track, while mixing it up with some trancey treatments to the second drop, adding just a bit more euphoria to the track. You could imagine the crowd will go nuts if the Coachella debutants drop this remix in the desert this weekend. You can catch the exclusive premiere of this remix and GalantisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ interview with Life+Times right here.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1399c27a3d8be20c5dbe0ed995c6f7f6eeaf47df","amp;dn":"Galantis+-+You+%28Tiesto+%26amp%3B+Twoloud+Remix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1399c27a3d8be20c5dbe0ed995c6f7f6eeaf47df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,153,194,122,61,139,226,12,93,190,14,217,149,198,247,246,238,175,71,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
