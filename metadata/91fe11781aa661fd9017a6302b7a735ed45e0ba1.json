Video files are in Xvid.\n\nIt\\'s my first rip, so any CONSTRUCTIVE criticism is appreciated.\n\nDEscriptION:\n\nInsurgentes is the new documentary film about Steven Wilson (Porcupine Tree) directed by Lasse Hoile. Porcupine Tree are currently enjoying massive success across the world with their latest album, The Incident. Insurgentes is a musical road movie that follows the making of his solo record of the same name, and is a portrait of an increasingly rare artist who works with music and media out of love and not for fame and fortune, persisting in making art on his own terms in a world where \\'throw away\\' mentality is increasingly becoming the norm. The film features footage of Wilson with other artists and friends including Mikael Akerfeldt from Opeth, Jonas Renkse from Katatonia, the Israeli superstar Aviv Geffen, and the legendary producer Trevor Horn.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91fe11781aa661fd9017a6302b7a735ed45e0ba1","amp;dn":"Insurgentes%3A+The+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91fe11781aa661fd9017a6302b7a735ed45e0ba1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,254,17,120,26,166,97,253,144,23,166,48,43,122,115,94,212,94,11,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
