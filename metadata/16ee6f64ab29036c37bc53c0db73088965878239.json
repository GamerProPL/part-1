Inviting fans over the Internet, on the street, and even in his family's hometown of Yellow Springs, OH, Chappelle asked filmmaker Michel Gondry to document the event from its inception on through to the performances themselves. The result is Dave Chappelle's Block Party, a concert film that provides not only a sampling of the music on display that September, but also an intimate look at the comedian himself. Gondry's cameras tag along with Chappelle as he visits Ohio, recruits a university marching band to play at the show, and surveys the opinions of Clinton Hill on the show that's about to take place. Along the way, we're introduced to some the comedian's favorite acts, in rehearsals and on-stage: Dead Prez, Jill Scott, Mos Def, the Roots, Erykah Badu, Kanye West, and the surprise reuniting of the Fugees. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 43 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16ee6f64ab29036c37bc53c0db73088965878239","amp;dn":"Dave+Chappelle%5C%27s+Block+Party%282005%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16ee6f64ab29036c37bc53c0db73088965878239","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,238,111,100,171,41,3,108,55,188,83,192,219,115,8,137,101,135,130,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
