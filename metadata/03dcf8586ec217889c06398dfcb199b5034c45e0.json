They found they had a mutual interest in music and sung together in the church choir. It was there that they decided to make a career in music and recorded a demo. The tape came to the attention of producer Teddy Riley who was so impressed he took control of production of their debut album. It's About Time went double platinum, helped by several singles.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Anything                                             [02:49]\n02.I'm so into you                                      [04:39]\n03.Right here                                           [04:38]\n04.Weak                                                 [04:52]\n05.You're always on my mind                             [05:17]\n06.Downtown                                             [05:13]\n07.Coming home                                          [04:22]\n08.Give it to me                                        [04:06]\n09.Blak pudd'n                                          [03:50]\n10.It's about time                                      [04:39]\n11.Think you're gonna like it                           [03:19]\n12.That's what I need                                   [04:28]\n13.SWV (in the house)                                   [03:00]\n14.Weak (A cappella)                                    [01:21]\n15.Right here,human nature remix                        [03:47]\n________\n60:20 min\n 85,7 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03dcf8586ec217889c06398dfcb199b5034c45e0","amp;dn":"SWV-Its_About_Time-%28Retail%29-1992-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03dcf8586ec217889c06398dfcb199b5034c45e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,220,248,88,110,194,23,136,156,6,57,141,252,177,153,181,3,76,69,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
