With our country's entire counter\nterrorism force rushing to action, the culprit is soon apprehended, but the\nwhereabouts of his bombs remain unknown. Heading up the investigation or so\nshe thinks-is FBI agent Helen Brody, an expert in her field, who has only\ntwo days to find the bombs but who, unfortunately, is not making much\nprogress. Then, Brody is forced to work alongside a freelance interrogator,\nknown only as H (Jackson), whose brutal methods are diametrically opposed to\nhers. H crosses lines that no one else will, but since he gets results, he\nhas the full support of the government. With the clock ticking, and the\nmoral compass constantly shifting, Brody-and the audience-must question\ntheir most basic assumptions about fear and paranoia, about strength and\ncruelty, and about right and wrong.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Samuel L Jackson.\n=&gt;-Carrie-Anne Moss.\n=&gt;-Michael Sheen.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Gregor Jordan.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Thriller : Drama.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2010.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.36 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 006 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 37mn.\n=&gt;-Unthinkable................: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/unthinkable/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 1.85:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 688.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1889 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 216 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34f04355a15e7f483e13af7d4184f35b8ede0439","amp;dn":"Unthinkable+-+Samuel+L+Jackson+Thriller+2010+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34f04355a15e7f483e13af7d4184f35b8ede0439","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,240,67,85,161,94,127,72,62,19,175,125,65,132,243,91,142,222,4,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
