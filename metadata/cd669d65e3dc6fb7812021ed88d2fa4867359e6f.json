TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re accustomed to getting anything they want. Anything at all. For Gabe, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s making one particular fantasy come true with a woman who was forbidden fruit. Now sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ripe for the picking...\n\nWhen Gabe Hamilton saw Mia Crestwell walk into the ballroom for his hotelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grand opening, he knew he was going to hell for what he had planned. After all, Mia is his best friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s little sister. Except sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not so little anymore. And Gabe has waited a long time to act on his desires.\n\nGabe has starred in MiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fantasies more than once, ever since she was a teenager with a huge crush on her brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friend. So what if GabeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fourteen years older? Mia knows heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way out of her league, but her attraction has only grown stronger with time. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an adult now, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no reason not to act on her most secret desires.\n\nAs Gabe pulls her into his provocative world, she realizes thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lot she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know about him or how exacting his demands can be. Their relationship is intense and obsessive, but as they cross the line from secret sexual odyssey to something deeper, their affair runs the risk of being exposedÃ¢â‚¬â€and vulnerable to a betrayal far more intimate than either expected.\n\n\n                             Book 1 - Rush\n\n                             Book 2 - Fever\n\n                             Book 3 - Burn\n\n\n                             Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                             Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd669d65e3dc6fb7812021ed88d2fa4867359e6f","amp;dn":"Breathless+Trilogy+Complete+by+Maya+Banks+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd669d65e3dc6fb7812021ed88d2fa4867359e6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,102,157,101,227,220,111,183,129,32,33,237,136,210,250,72,103,53,158,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
