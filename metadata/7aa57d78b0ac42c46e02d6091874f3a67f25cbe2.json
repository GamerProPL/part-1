Samantha, though, is one of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“luckyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ associates. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s offered an opportunity to work at a legal aid clinic for one year without pay, after which there would be a slim chance that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d get her old job back.\n\nIn a matter of days Samantha moves from Manhattan to Brady, Virginia, population 2,200, in the heart of Appalachia, a part of the world she has only read about. Mattie Wyatt, lifelong Brady resident and head of the townÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legal aid clinic, is there to teach her how to Ã¢â‚¬Å“help real people with real problems.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ For the first time in her career, Samantha prepares a lawsuit, sees the inside of an actual courtroom, gets scolded by a judge, and receives threats from locals who arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so thrilled to have a big-city lawyer in town. And she learns that Brady, like most small towns, harbors some big secrets.\n\nHer new job takes Samantha into the murky and dangerous world of coal mining, where laws are often broken, rules are ignored, regulations are flouted, communities are divided, and the land itself is under attack from Big Coal. Violence is always just around the corner, and within weeks Samantha finds herself engulfed in litigation that turns deadly.\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7aa57d78b0ac42c46e02d6091874f3a67f25cbe2","amp;dn":"John+Grisham+-+Gray+Mountain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7aa57d78b0ac42c46e02d6091874f3a67f25cbe2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,165,125,120,176,172,66,196,110,2,214,9,24,116,243,166,127,37,203,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
