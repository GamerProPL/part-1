The three bonded over their love for Frank Zappa, Mahavishnu Orchestra, The Beatles and Harry Nilsson. Those influences would become the seeds for what Thank You Scientist would evolve into today.\n\nTo pinpoint Thank You ScientistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound would be inconceivable. On Maps of Non-Existent Places they hold a virtual master class on musicianship, fusing elements of progressive rock with jazz fusion, classical, metal, psychedelic and pop for a head spinning, mind-blowing listening experience. The seven-piece band, who collectively play some 20 instruments, boasts a hyper-composed sound which is indebted to their experience and formal training in both classical and jazz idioms.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e5ec591ae7cb7f0bc533cdb7358b63a75ee5474","amp;dn":"Thank+You+Scientist+-+Maps+of+Non-Existent+Places","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e5ec591ae7cb7f0bc533cdb7358b63a75ee5474","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,94,197,145,174,124,183,240,188,83,60,219,115,88,182,58,117,238,84,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
