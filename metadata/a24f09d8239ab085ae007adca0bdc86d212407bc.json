In this highly anticipated cookbook, Ken Forkish-owner of the beloved restaurant Ken's Artisan Pizza in Portland, Oregon; the James Beard and IACP Award-winning author of Flour Water Salt Yeast; and one of the most trusted baking authorities in the country-proves that amazing pizza is within reach of any home cook.\r\n\r\nThe Elements of Pizza breaks down each step of the pizza-making process, from choosing a dough to shaping your pie to selecting cheeses and toppings that will work for your home kitchen setup. Forkish offers more than a dozen different dough recipes-same-day &quot;Saturday doughs&quot; that you can make in the morning to bake pizza that night, levain doughs made from a naturally fermented yeast starter, and even gluten-free dough-each of which results in the best, most texturally sublime crust you've ever made at home. His clear, expert instructions will have you shaping pies and loading a pizza peel with the confidence of a professional pizzaiolo. And his innovative, seasonal topping ideas will surprise and delight any pizza lover-and inspire you to create your own signature pies, just the way you like them.\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/shtihl22\r\n\r\n=======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a24f09d8239ab085ae007adca0bdc86d212407bc","amp;dn":"The+Elements+of+Pizza+-+Unlocking+the+Secrets+to+World-Class+Pie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a24f09d8239ab085ae007adca0bdc86d212407bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,79,9,216,35,154,176,133,174,0,122,220,160,189,200,109,33,36,7,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
