You wish you did not have to go outside, but you do. It would be easier to give up. But you donâ€™t. The hardship, the hunger, the thirst. The fear. You keep reminding yourself why you stay alive. Why you do this. Then you hear it. â€œDaddy youâ€™re back.â€ You wifeâ€™s face lights up and you open a bag full of medical supplies. You need not tell her how you got them. You simply enjoy your small victory in this, the harshest of times.
