UK edition.\n\n***Thanks to the original uploader***\n\n\ndescription:\n\nA riveting suspense thriller: a retired cop and a couple of unlikely allies race against time to stop a psycho-loner intent on blowing up thousands...\n\nA cat-and-mouse suspense thriller featuring a retired homicide detective who's haunted by the few cases he left open, and by one in particular - the pre-dawn slaughter of eight people among hundreds gathered in line for the opening of a jobs fair when the economy was guttering out. Without warning, a lone driver ploughed through the crowd in a stolen Mercedes. The plot is kicked into gear when Bill Hodges receives a letter in the mail, from a man claiming to be the perpetrator. He taunts Hodges with the notion that he will strike again.\n\nHodges wakes up from his depressed and vacant retirement, hell-bent on preventing that from happening.\n\nBrady Hartfield lives with his alcoholic mother in the house where he was born. And he's preparing to kill again.\n\nOnly Hodges, with a couple of misfit friends, can apprehend the killer in this high-stakes race against time. Because Brady's next mission, if it succeeds, will kill or maim hundreds, even thousands.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea39483b74867bbfd6387cfcf589394403b172ee","amp;dn":"Stephen+King+-+Mr+Mercedes+%28epub%2C+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea39483b74867bbfd6387cfcf589394403b172ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,57,72,59,116,134,123,191,214,56,124,252,245,137,57,68,3,177,114,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
