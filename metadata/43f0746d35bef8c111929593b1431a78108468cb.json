It covers the usual topics found in an engineering course: solution of equations, interpolation and data fitting, solution of differential equations, eigenvalue problems, and optimization. The algorithms are implemented in Python 3, a high-level programming language that rivals MATLABÃ‚Â® in readability and ease of use.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43f0746d35bef8c111929593b1431a78108468cb","amp;dn":"Numerical+Methods+in+Engineering+With+Python+3%2C+3E+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43f0746d35bef8c111929593b1431a78108468cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,240,116,109,53,190,248,193,17,146,149,147,177,67,26,120,16,132,104,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
