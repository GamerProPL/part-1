His particular tragedy waited until he was primed to lose it all: in one spectacular night, a reckless driver shatters EzraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s knee, his athletic career, and his social life.\n\nNo longer a front-runner for Homecoming King, Ezra finds himself at the table of misfits, where he encounters new girl Cassidy Thorpe. Cassidy is unlike anyone EzraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever met, achingly effortless, fiercely intelligent, and determined to bring Ezra along on her endless adventures.\n\nBut as Ezra dives into his new studies, new friendships, and new love, he learns that some people, like books, are easy to misread. And now he must consider: if oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singular tragedy has already hit and everything after it has mattered quite a bit, what happens when more misfortune strikes?\n\nRobyn SchneiderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Beginning of Everything is a lyrical, witty, and heart-wrenching novel about how difficult it is to play the part that people expect, and how new beginnings can stem from abrupt and tragic endings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7520612c4123480461f3ef0e15d41b9959fa1109","amp;dn":"The+Beginning+of+Everything+-+Robyn+Schneider.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7520612c4123480461f3ef0e15d41b9959fa1109","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,32,97,44,65,35,72,4,97,243,239,14,21,212,27,153,89,250,17,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
