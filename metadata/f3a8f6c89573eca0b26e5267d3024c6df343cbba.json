It also doesn't matter, as Coheed and Cambria rock too hard to be held back by a less than normal quality.\n\nThis discography contains every Coheed and Cambria album to date, including the currently unreleased to the public, Year Of The Black Rainbow. For those who're looking to get into the band, but haven't exactly heard much of them or have mixed feelings, I suggest going ahead and listening to the track &quot;Welcome Home&quot; off of the 2005 album &quot;Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness&quot;. Either download the torrent and listen to it, or check it out onor something. If you don't like that track, chances are Coheed and Cambria aren't for you. Below are the contents of the torrent:\n\nStudio Albums:\nThe Second Stage Turbine Blade || (2002)\nIn Keeping Secrets Of Silent Earth: 3 || (2003)\nGood Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness || (2005)\nGood Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume Two: No World for Tomorrow || (2007)\nYear Of The Black Rainbow || (2010)\n\nBe kind, rewind.\n\nI mean seed. I should be seeding for as long as I have this laptop, as I pretty much never shut it off, but other seeders are always a great help as well. Really helps speed up the download time. I'm also taking requests for album/discography uploads. I have a veeeeery extensive collection of music and am always happy to share the wealth. Just post a comment in my most recent torrent and I'll see what I can do.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3a8f6c89573eca0b26e5267d3024c6df343cbba","amp;dn":"Coheed+and+Cambria+Discography+%282002-2010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3a8f6c89573eca0b26e5267d3024c6df343cbba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,168,246,200,149,115,236,160,178,110,82,103,211,2,76,109,243,67,203,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
