In 1988 he became the first writer in Arabic to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1988.  The prize citation praised Mahfouz &quot;who, through works rich in nuance -- now clear-sightedly realistic, now evocatively ambiguous -- has formed an Arabian narrative art that applies to all mankind.&quot;\n\n\nMahfouz is regarded as one of the first contemporary writers of Arabic literature, along with Tawfiq el-Hakim, to explore themes of existentialism.  A student of philosophy and an avid reader, his works range from reimaginings of ancient myths to subtle commentaries on contemporary Egyptian politics and culture.  Mahfouz's stories are almost always set in the heavily populated urban quarters of Cairo, where his characters, mostly ordinary people, try to cope with the modernization of society and the temptations of Western values.\n\nHis early novels, such RHADOPIS OF NUBIA (1943), were set in ancient Egypt, but he had turned to describing modern Egyptian society by the time he began his most famous work, the epic CAIRO TRILOGY (1956-57).  Its three novels -- PALACE WALK (1956), PALACE OF DESIRE (1957), and SUGAR STREET (1957) -- depict the lives of three generations of different families in Cairo from World War I until after the 1952 military coup that overthrew King Farouk.  The trilogy provides a penetrating overview of 20th-century Egyptian thought, attitudes, and social change.\n\nIn subsequent works Mahfouz offered critical views of the old Egyptian monarchy, British colonialism, and contemporary Egypt.  Several of his more notable novels deal with social issues involving women and political prisoners. The novel CHILDREN OF THE ALLEY (1959) was banned in Egypt for a time because of its controversial treatment of religion and its use of characters based on Muhammad, Moses, and other figures.  Islamic militants, partly because of their outrage over the work, later called for his death, and in 1994 Mahfouz was stabbed in the neck.\n\nOther novels include THE BEGGER (1965), ADRIFT ON THE NILE (1966), and MIRAMAR (1967), all of which depict the decadence of Egyptian society during the Gamal Abdel Nasser era; WEDDING SONG (1981), set among several characters associated with a Cairo theatre company; and the structurally experimental MORNING AND EVENING TALK (1987), which strings together in alphabetical order dozens of character sketches.  Together, his novels, which were among the first to gain widespread acceptance in the Arabic-speaking world, brought the genre to maturity within Arabic literature.\n\nMahfouz's achievements as a short-story writer are demonstrated in such collections as THE TIME AND THE PLACE &amp; OTHER STORIES (1991) and THE SEVENTH HEAVEN (2005).  ECHOES OF AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY (1996) is a collection of parables and his sayings.  ON LITERATURE AND PHILOSOPHY (2016) brings together Mahfouz's early nonfiction writings (most penned during the 1930s), offering a fascinating window not just into the mind of the author himself but the changing landscape of Egypt during that time, from the development of Islam to the struggles between tradition, modernity, and the influences of the West. \n\n\nThis is an updated version of an earlier torrent and includes many new retail editions.
