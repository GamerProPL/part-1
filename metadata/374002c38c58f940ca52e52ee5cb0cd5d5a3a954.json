Cesar&amp;#039;s amazing rehabilitations of aggressive, scared, lazy, compulsive, and jealous dogs captured the national spotlight when his National Geographic Channel (NGC) series Dog Whisperer premiered in September 2004. Regular viewers soon came to realize it wasn&amp;#039;t the dogs but the quirky owners who needed Cesar&amp;#039;s help the most. In January 2006, Dog Whisperer returned for a primetime second season with expanded hour-long episodes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:374002c38c58f940ca52e52ee5cb0cd5d5a3a954","amp;dn":"The+Dog+Whisperer+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"374002c38c58f940ca52e52ee5cb0cd5d5a3a954","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,64,2,195,140,88,249,64,202,82,229,46,229,203,12,213,213,163,169,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
