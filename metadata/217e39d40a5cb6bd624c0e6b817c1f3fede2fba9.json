Each has a favorite in that collection, and none can imagine life without the peace and completion it brings. Though mere acquaintances, they plot a theft of the three pieces between the time they are packed and the time they're loaded onto a plane. First each must obtain a forgery; then, they have to smuggle the forgeries into the museum and find a way to make the switches. The heist is complicated by Roger's intrusive wife - he's promised her a trip to Florida for their anniversary - and George's proclivity for taking his clothes off when standing in front of the warrior statue he loves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:217e39d40a5cb6bd624c0e6b817c1f3fede2fba9","amp;dn":"The+Maiden+Heist+%282009%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"217e39d40a5cb6bd624c0e6b817c1f3fede2fba9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,126,57,212,10,92,182,189,98,76,14,107,129,124,31,63,237,226,251,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
