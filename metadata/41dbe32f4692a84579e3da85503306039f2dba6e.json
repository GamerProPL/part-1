He was born Kenneth Clarke Loggins in Everett, WA in early 1948, and the family later moved to Detroit, and finally to Alhambra, CA when he was in his teens. He initially turned to music as a way of compensating for his extreme shyness, and found that he was, indeed, a talented guitarist and had a voice. For a time in the late '60s he was based in Pasadena, studying at Pasadena City College. At the end of the decade, Loggins passed through the lineup of a band called Gator Creek, who were good enough to get signed to Mercury Records. The group recorded one self-titled album, which was issued in 1970 and included an early version of &quot;Danny's Song,&quot; a track that he later recorded again as part of Loggins &amp; Messina. He also spent time with a short-lived group called Second Helping, and was a member of the stage incarnation of the Electric Prunes during a later phase of that group's history.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.This Is It\n02.Whenever I  Call You Friend\n03.Footloose\n04.Heart To Heart\n05.Danger Zone\n06.Meet Me Half Way\n07.I'm Alright (Theme From 'Caddyshack')\n08.Return To Pooh Corner\n09.Don't Fight It\n10.Forever\n11.Conviction Of The Heart\n12.The Real Thing\n13.For The First Time\n14.Celebrate Me Home\n15.The Rest Of Your Life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                   ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41dbe32f4692a84579e3da85503306039f2dba6e","amp;dn":"Kenny+Loggins+-+Greatest+Hits++%281997%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41dbe32f4692a84579e3da85503306039f2dba6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,219,227,47,70,146,168,69,121,227,218,133,80,51,6,3,159,45,186,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
