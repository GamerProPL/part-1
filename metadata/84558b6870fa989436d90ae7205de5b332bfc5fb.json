He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.  \n\nAlthough Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84558b6870fa989436d90ae7205de5b332bfc5fb","amp;dn":"Steve+Jobs+The+Biography+by+Walter+Isaacson+EPUB+file","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84558b6870fa989436d90ae7205de5b332bfc5fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,85,139,104,112,250,152,148,54,217,10,231,32,93,229,179,50,191,197,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
