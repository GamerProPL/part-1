I found myself working in Wyoming living in a bunk house with a bunch of old cowpokes and ranch hands, and a lot of those guys had grown up in a era before radio had even got to Wyoming. Their idea of an evening was to tell stories and sing songs. I was the kid with the guitar I was the accompaniment.I learned a bunch of those songs and got steeped into that tradition. Itâ€™s a tradition thatâ€™s almost gone. Iâ€™ve been sort of wondering what to do with that, for decades now. About four years ago, I did a webcast with Josh and a bunch of the guys from of The National. I enjoyed playing with them a bunch. They decided that they liked my cowboy tunes with the Grateful Dead, and proposed a project where we do some stuff like that. That proposal kinda rang my bells.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d65cb52d0ec629dbcfd20dacde9c734662e3810e","amp;dn":"Bob+Weir+-+Blue+Mountain+%28HD+24%2F48%29+%282016%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d65cb52d0ec629dbcfd20dacde9c734662e3810e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,92,181,45,14,198,41,219,207,210,13,172,222,156,115,70,98,227,129,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
