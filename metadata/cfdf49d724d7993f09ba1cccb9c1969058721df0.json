After losing hundreds of thousands of dollars back when a beer cost a nickel, he found himself neck-deep in debt. His heiress wife, Livy, took the setback hard. â€œI have a perfect horror and heart-sickness over it,â€ she wrote. â€œI cannot get away from the feeling that business failure means disgrace.â€\r\n\r\nBut Twain vowed to Livy he would pay back every penny. And so, just when the fifty-nine-year-old, bushy-browed icon imagined that he would be settling into literary lionhood, telling jokes at gilded dinners, he forced himself to mount the â€œplatformâ€ again, embarking on a round-the-world stand-up comedy tour. No author had ever done that. He cherry-picked his best storiesâ€”such as stealing his first watermelon and buying a bucking broncoâ€”and spun them into a ninety-minute performance.\r\n\r\nTwain trekked across the American West and onward by ship to the faraway lands of Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, India, Ceylon, and South Africa. He rode an elephant twice and visited the Taj Mahal. He saw Zulus dancing and helped sort diamonds at the Kimberley mines. (He failed to slip away with a sparkly souvenir.) He played shuffleboard on cruise ships and battled captains for the right to smoke in peace. He complained that his wife and daughter made him shave and change his shirt every day","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfdf49d724d7993f09ba1cccb9c1969058721df0","amp;dn":"Chasing+the+Last+Laugh%3A+Mark+Twain%27s+Raucous+%282016%29+Richard+Zack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfdf49d724d7993f09ba1cccb9c1969058721df0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,223,73,215,36,215,153,63,9,186,28,204,185,193,150,144,88,114,29,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
