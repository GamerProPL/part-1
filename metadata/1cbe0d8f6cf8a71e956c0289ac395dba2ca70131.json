The tour dubbed the Prepare for Hell tour will be co-headlined by Korn with King 810 as support. They have also been confirmed, along with several other major acts, to be performing at 2015's Soundwave festival in Australia. A bassist and drummer were added to the band to replace Gray and Jordison respectively with Crahan designing two similar masks for them to wear in music videos and whilst performing on stage. The official video for The Devil In I was released on September 12 featured members wearing slightly modified versions of their older masks with the exception of Taylor who wore a brand new mask. The new drummer and bassist were also briefly shown masked, however their identities have not been released by the band amidst speculation.\n\nUploader Speaks-This is rough with mixed bitrates and one missing track and this is the best you got NOW later ...What else are ya doing anyway?\n\nDiscography\n\nSlipknot (1999)\nIowa (2001)\nVol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses) (2004)\nAll Hope Is Gone (2008)\n.5: The Gray Chapter (2014)\n\n\n\n.5: The Gray Chapter (2014)\n\n\n\n01.XIX\n02.Sarcatastrohe\n03.AOV\n04.The Devil In I\n05.Killpop\n06.Skeptic\n07.Lech\n08.Goodbye\n09.Nomadic\n10.The One That Kills the Least\n11.Custer\n12.Be Prepared for Hell\n13.The Negative One\n\n\n\nThe songs are in various different bitrates, as follows:\n\n1.320\n2.320\n3.320\n4.192\n5.320\n6.128\n7.128\n8.128\n9.128\n10.128\n11.128\n12.128\n13.192\n14.
