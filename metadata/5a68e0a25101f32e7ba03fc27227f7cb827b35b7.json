This has inspired intense research into sustainable energy sources. Biofuels seemed initially promising, but the world soon realized that food-based biofuel has its own dangers. Second-generation biofuels, however, use biomass from crops' inedible partsâ€”such as the stalks and leaves of sugarcaneâ€”offering a far more practical, sustainable, and commercially viable solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this book, researchers from around the world review some of the most important and timely topics related to using sugarcane feedstock for biofuel. After a basic overview, topics such as these are included:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPretreatment methods\r\n\r\nThe use of various microbial technologies, including bacteria and yeast, to enhance biofuel production\r\n\r\nEnvironmental impacts\r\n\r\nEconomic feasibility\r\n\r\nThe viability of electricity being produced side by side with biofuel\r\n\r\n\r\nEssential reading for graduate students and research scientists investigating second-generation biofuels, this book is also recommended for environmentalists, environmental engineers, and microbiologists","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a68e0a25101f32e7ba03fc27227f7cb827b35b7","amp;dn":"Sugarcane+as+Biofuel+Feedstock+-+Advances+Toward+a+Sustainable+E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a68e0a25101f32e7ba03fc27227f7cb827b35b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,104,224,162,81,1,243,46,123,160,63,194,114,39,247,203,130,123,53,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
