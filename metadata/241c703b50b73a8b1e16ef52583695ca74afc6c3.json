The definition of the concept is exactly the same. Re-wrote and revised almost all of Chapter 2.\nPUA tactics are now referred to as Ã¢â‚¬Å“PerformanceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ behaviors towards women. Added explanation of why performance is not confident nor attractive.\nEliminated the idea that men must always be less invested than women for a relationship to be healthy.\nAdded the examples from Vulnerability and Manipulative Women to Chapter 3.\nRevised many examples to minimize the focus on cold approaching in bars/clubs.\nRevised parts of Chapters 6 and 8 to emphasize that rejection represents incompatibility not inadequacy.\nAdded more good places to meet women in Chapter 8.\nDrastically shortened the sections on fitness and nutrition in Chapter 9. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m no expert and god knows you can find more information than youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d ever need online.\nCut out the section about being well-read in Chapter 9.\nDeleted the Stereotypes and Responsibility section from Chapter 10 because it was redundant and repetitive.\nCut out a lot of PUAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ish stuff from Chapter 11.\nRewrote my explanations of flirting in Chapter 11. Instead of describing breaking rapport, I explained sexual tension and how itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s generated. Ultimately I think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a much less theoretical and practical concept than breaking rapport was.\nExpanded a bit on approaching and first impressions in Chapter 12.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postmasculine.com/the-final-models-revision&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postmasculine.com/the-final-models-revision&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:241c703b50b73a8b1e16ef52583695ca74afc6c3","amp;dn":"Models%3A+Attract+Women+Through+Honesty+Final+Revision+by+Mark+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"241c703b50b73a8b1e16ef52583695ca74afc6c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,28,112,59,80,183,58,139,30,22,239,82,88,54,149,202,116,175,198,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
