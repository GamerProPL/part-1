There are some of Tom JobimÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s songs sung by other performers (and The Beatles in Bossa Nova, and also Disney in Bossa Nova). \n\nI put a Roupa Nova's album (Roupa Nova Acoustic, which contains the band's biggest hits in acoustic versions. It's a very good album). Roupa Nova makes extensive use of vocal harmonies. If you like melodic songs, I think you should check it out. (Para quem gosta do RN, mas jÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ possui o AcÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºstico 1, dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ uma olhada pq coloquei outras mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºsicas tb. Destaque: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCriaturas da NoiteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ e ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCarolinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, conhecida na voz de Caetano Veloso).\n\nThere is another folder with more MPB songs (Marisa Monte, Djavan...) \n\nThere are brazilian POP and Rock songs. In this folder, I suggest Skank, Kid Abelha, Ultrage a Rigor and Rita Lee (the brazilian rockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mother). Skank and Ultrage a Rigor are fun bands!!!\n\nIf you like instrumental songs, check the Instrumental folder. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChoroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChorinhoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a brazilian music style (itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a kind of classical samba which was born in 19th century). Choro is played by a trio of flute, guitar and cavaquinho (a small chordophone with four strings), sometimes other instruments like mandolim, clarinet, trumpet and trombone. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s very interesting!! In the same folder there are Almir SaterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s instrumental songs (acoustic guitar solos). He plays a ten string guitar known in Brazil as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œviola caipiraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (something like backwood guitar). ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s very interesting, too.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf1526569f36be518b4977b2a8de88dd9a8e4ccc","amp;dn":"Great+Brazilian+Songs+2+-+Bossa+Nova%2C+MPB%2C+Choro%2C+POP+and+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf1526569f36be518b4977b2a8de88dd9a8e4ccc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,21,38,86,159,54,190,81,139,73,119,178,168,222,136,221,154,142,76,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
