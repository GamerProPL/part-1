This book takes recipes and techniques and puts them under the microscope. How to get the best when shopping? What the preparation and cooking stages are? What to look for? What should it feel and smell like? How to save the day if something isn''t right? What to serve with it? What to do with the leftovers (if there are any)? The result is home cooking at its most perfect. Victoria Blashford-Snell trained at Le Cordon Bleu, runs a highly successful catering company in London, and is a regular cooking teacher and demonstrator in Italy, Somerset, and at London''s Books for Cooks. She has co-authored DK's Hors d'Oeuvres. Austrialia chef Brigitte Hafner writes the weekly recipes for The Sydney Morning Herald's Good Living and Melbourne Age's Epicure sections and with partner James Broadway, runs a popular wine bar and eatery in Melbourne's Fitzroy called The Gertrude Street Enoteca.\n\nDK Publishing 2008\nfull color 546 pages[/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c50e0218149de08ddf2ed00ecc30e6102845e3bb","amp;dn":"The+Illustrated+Kitchen+Bible+-+10cipes+from+around+the+wor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c50e0218149de08ddf2ed00ecc30e6102845e3bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,14,2,24,20,157,224,141,223,46,208,14,204,48,230,16,40,69,227,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
