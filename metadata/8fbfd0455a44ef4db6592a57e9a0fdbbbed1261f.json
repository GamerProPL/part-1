In Everything I Want to Eat, Koslow shares 100 of her favorite recipes for health-conscious but delicious dishes, all of which always use real foodsâ€”no fake meat or fake sugar hereâ€”that also happen to be suitable for vegetarians, vegans, or whomever youÃ¢Â€â„¢re sharing your meal with.\r\n\r\nThe book is organized into seven chapters, each featuring a collection of recipes centered on a key ingredient or theme. Expect to find recipes for dishes Sqirl has become known for, as well as brand-new seasonal flavor combinations, including:\r\n\r\n\r\nRaspberry and cardamom jam\r\nSorrel-pesto rice bowl\r\nBurnt brioche toast with house ricotta and seasonal jam\r\nLamb merguez, cranberry beans, roasted tomato, and yogurt cheese\r\nValrhona chocolate fleur de sel cookies\r\nAlmond hazelnut milk\r\n\r\n\r\nKoslow lives in LA, where everyone is known to be obsessively health-conscious and where dietary restrictions are the norm. People come into Sqirl and order dishes with all sorts of substitutions and modificationsâ€”hold the feta, please, add extra kale. They are looking to make their own healthy adventures. Others may tack breakfast sausage, cured bacon, or OlliÃ¢Â€â„¢s prosciutto on to their order. So Koslow has had to constantly think about ways to modify dishes for certain diets, which in a way has made her a better, more adaptable cook","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fbfd0455a44ef4db6592a57e9a0fdbbbed1261f","amp;dn":"Everything+I+Want+to+Eat+%282016%29+%5BWWRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fbfd0455a44ef4db6592a57e9a0fdbbbed1261f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,191,208,69,90,68,239,77,182,89,42,87,233,160,253,187,190,209,38,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
