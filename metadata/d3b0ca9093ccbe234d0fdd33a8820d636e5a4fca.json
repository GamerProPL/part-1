In their prime, the O'Jays' recordings epitomized the Philly soul sound: smooth, rich harmonies backed by elaborate arrangements, lush strings, and a touch of contemporary funk. They worked extensively with the legendary production and songwriting team of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, becoming the flagship artist of the duo's Philadelphia International label. The O'Jays were equally at home singing sweet love ballads or uptempo dance tunes, the latter of which were \noften mouthpieces for Gamble &amp; Huff's social concerns. Although the O'Jays couldn't sustain their widespread popularity in the post-disco age, they have continued to record steadily all the way up to the present day, modifying their production to keep up with the times. \n\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Lonely Drifter\n02.Lipstick Traces (On A Cigarette)\n03.Stand In For Love (Live Version)\n04.I'll Be Sweeter Tomorrow (Than I Was Today)\n05.There's Someone (Waiting Back Home)\n06.One Night Affair\n07.Deeper (In Love With You)\n08.Back Stabbers\n09.992 Arguments\n10.Love Train\n11.Time To Get Down\n12.Put Your Hands Together\n13.Sunshine (Part 1)\n14.You Got Your Hooks In Me\n15.Now That We Found Love\n16.For The Love Of Money\n17.Give The People What They Want\n18.Survival\n19.Let Me Make Love To You\n20.Love Music\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Livin' For The Weekend\n02.Stairway To Heaven\n03.Family Reunion\n04.Ship Ahoy (2008 Single Version)\n05.Message In Our Music\n06.Darlin' Darlin' Baby (Sweet Tender Love)\n07.The Big Gangster\n08.Use Ta Be My Girl\n09.Brandy (I Really Miss You)\n10.Cry Together\n11.Forever Mine\n12.Sing A Happy Song\n13.Lovin' You\n14.Wind Beneath My Wings\n15.Emotionally Yours (Gospel Version)\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3b0ca9093ccbe234d0fdd33a8820d636e5a4fca","amp;dn":"The+O%5C%27Jays+-+The+Essential+O%5C%27Jays+%282008%29+Mp3+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3b0ca9093ccbe234d0fdd33a8820d636e5a4fca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,176,202,144,147,204,190,35,77,15,221,51,168,130,13,99,110,90,79,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
