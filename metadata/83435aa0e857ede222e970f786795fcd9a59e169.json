It focuses on the shenanigans of the three-strong IT support team located in a dingy, untidy and unkempt basementÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a stark contrast to the shining modern architecture and stunning London views enjoyed by the rest of the organisation. The obscurity surrounding what the company does serves as a running gag throughout the seriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½all that is known is that the company bought and sold ITV and once made part-year profits of &quot;eighteen hundred billion billion&quot;. The team consists of what Douglas Reynholm describes as &quot;a dynamic go-getter (Jen), a genius (Moss) and a man from Ireland (Roy)&quot;\n\n***********************************************************************************\nEPISODE LIST\n------------\nSeason 1\n--------\n1\t&quot;Yesterday's Jam&quot;\n2\t&quot;Calamity Jen&quot;\n3\t&quot;Fifty-Fifty&quot;\n4\t&quot;The Red door&quot;\n5\t&quot;The Haunting of Bill Crouse&quot;\n6\t&quot;Aunt Irma Visits&quot;\nSeason 2\n--------\n1\t&quot;The Work Outing&quot;\n2\t&quot;Return of the Golden Child&quot;\n3\t&quot;Moss and the German&quot;\n4\t&quot;The Dinner Party&quot;\n5\t&quot;Smoke and Mirrors&quot;\n6\t&quot;Men without Women&quot;\nSeason 3\n--------\n1\t&quot;From Hell&quot;\n2\t&quot;Are We Not Men&quot;\n3\t&quot;Tramps Like Us&quot;\n4\t&quot;The Speech&quot;\n5\t&quot;Friendface&quot;\n6\t&quot;Calendar Geeks&quot;\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nAll videos were ripped by both ORGANiC &amp; RiVER (TV rips) and have been organized by GOLDFiSH...\n\n\nVideo Format     - XVID\nVideo Quality    - ~1000kbps\nVideo Resolution - 640 x 352\nFrame Rate       - 25 fps\n   \nSound Quality    - 127kbps\nSound Channels   - 2 (stereo)\n\nSeed, enjoy :)\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83435aa0e857ede222e970f786795fcd9a59e169","amp;dn":"The+IT+Crowd+-+Seasons+1%2C+2+%26+3+%7BGOLDFiSH%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83435aa0e857ede222e970f786795fcd9a59e169","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,67,90,160,232,87,237,226,34,233,112,247,134,121,95,205,154,89,225,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
