You must drive to a timetable on a planned route, whilst obeying traffic rules, and taking care not to upset or injure your passengers. This makes Bus Driver unlike any other driving game - the experience of driving a bus is very different from blazing through a racing circuit.\n\nBus Driver offers twelve different kinds of buses to drive, an expansive city environment with various districts, and thirty routes with varying weather conditions set at differing times of day.\n\n    * 12 buses to drive, very detailed models inspired by real-world buses.\n    * 30 routes arranged into 5 tiers with increasing difficulty.\n    * Multiple duties, such as driving a school bus, transporting tourists, sight-seeing tours, and transportation of prisoners.\n    * High replay value based on sophisticated system of traffic rules and game-play related bonuses.\n    * Varying time-of-day and weather conditions\n    * Large city to drive in, with several districts of varying styles (modern, old-town, suburb, airport, harbour, and more).\n    * Living roads, with intelligent traffic controlled by our AI system.\n    * Non-violent game play, bus game suitable for everybody. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMinimum system requirements:\n------------------------------\n\n    * CPU: 1GHz Pentium III or equivalent\n    * RAM: 256MB\n    * Video Card: OpenGL 1.3 compatible 64MB AGP with hardware T&amp;L (see compatibility)\n    * Hard Disk: 300MB free space\n    * Operating System: Windows 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista with DirectX 9 installed\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nRecommended system:\n-------------------\n    * CPU: 1.5GHz Pentium IV or equivalent\n    * RAM: 512MB\n    * Video Card: OpenGL 1.5 compatible 128MB PCI Express with hardware T&amp;L (see compatibility)\n    * Hard Disk: 300MB free space\n    * Operating System: Windows XP or Vista with DirectX 9 installed\n    * Optional: DirectX compatible sound card\n    * Optional: DirectX compatible game pad or steering wheel \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-MORE OF MY TORRENTS:\n\n                        &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/back1ply&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/back1ply&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-PLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOAD \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69ef6fb68ccbe13fe84193a614676558edd0ec4d","amp;dn":"PC.Game.Bus.Driver.Full+%28ENGLISH%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69ef6fb68ccbe13fe84193a614676558edd0ec4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,239,111,182,140,203,225,63,232,65,147,166,20,103,101,88,237,208,236,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
