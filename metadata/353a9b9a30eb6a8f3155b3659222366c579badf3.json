The Animals had their origins in a Newcastle-based group called the Kansas City Five, whose membership included pianist Alan Price, drummer John Steel, and vocalist Eric Burdon. Price exited to join the Kontours in 1962, while Burdon went off to London. \n\n\nReview by Richie Unterberger allmusic.com\n\nThe title is a bit of a misnomer; this double CD only includes the complete sessions that the Animals recorded with producer Mickie Most in 1964 and 1965. The 40 songs capture the band at their peak, including most of their best and biggest hits: &quot;House of the Rising Sun,&quot; &quot;Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,&quot; &quot;Bring It on Home to Me,&quot; &quot;We Gotta Get Out of This Place,&quot; &quot;I'm Crying,&quot; &quot;It's My Life,&quot; and &quot;Boom Boom.&quot; Most of the rest of the tunes don't match the excellence of these smashes, though they're solid. The great majority of them are covers of vintage R&amp;B/rock tunes by Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, and the like, which aren't quite as durable as reinterpretations from the same era by the Stones and Yardbirds. \n\nTrack Listing:\n\nDisc 1\n\n1.
