Adam Wilbert teaches the basics of relational database design, regardless of whether you are using Access, FileMaker, Open Office, or SQL Server. Learn common database mistakes to look out for, discover how to diagram use cases and requirements to plan your design, and develop a conceptual data model'translating your ideas into components like tables, relationships, queries, and views.\n\nTopics include:\n===============\nWhat is a database management system (DBMS)\nMoving through the database development cycle\nPreventing duplicate, inconsistent, and conflicting data entries\nGathering requirements\nDeveloping relationships\nIdentifying key fields\nFollowing a naming convention\nDeveloping the actual database\n\n\n\nIntroduction 3m 15s\n-------------------\nWelcome 1m 10s\nWhat you should know before watching this course 1m 26s\nUsing the exercise files 39s\n\n1.
