We ingest 8,500 milligrams of salt a day, double the recommended amount, and almost none of that comes from the shakers on our table. It comes from processed food. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no wonder, then, that one in three adults, and one in five kids, is clinically obese. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no wonder that twenty-six million Americans have diabetes, the processed food industry in the U.S. accounts for $1 trillion a year in sales, and the total economic cost of this health crisis is approaching $300 billion a year.\n\nIn Salt Sugar Fat, Pulitzer PrizeÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning investigative reporter Michael Moss shows how we got here. Featuring examples from some of the most recognizable (and profitable) companies and brands of the last half centuryÃ¢â‚¬â€including Kraft, Coca-Cola, Lunchables, Kellogg, NestlÃƒÂ©, Oreos, Cargill, Capri Sun, and many moreÃ¢â‚¬â€MossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s explosive, empowering narrative is grounded in meticulous, often eye-opening research.\n\nMoss takes us inside the labs where food scientists use cutting-edge technology to calculate the Ã¢â‚¬Å“bliss pointÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of sugary beverages or enhance the Ã¢â‚¬Å“mouthfeelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of fat by manipulating its chemical structure. He unearths marketing campaigns designedÃ¢â‚¬â€in a technique adapted from tobacco companiesÃ¢â‚¬â€to redirect concerns about the health risks of their products: Dial back on one ingredient, pump up the other two, and tout the new line as Ã¢â‚¬Å“fat-freeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“low-salt.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He talks to concerned executives who confess that they could never produce truly healthy alternatives to their products even if serious regulation became a reality. Simply put: The industry itself would cease to exist without salt, sugar, and fat. Just as millions of Ã¢â‚¬Å“heavy usersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€as the companies refer to their most ardent customersÃ¢â‚¬â€are addicted to this seductive trio, so too are the companies that peddle them. You will never look at a nutrition label the same way again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c8835b3715c29f825b6d9e64a24267e043375f0","amp;dn":"Salt+Sugar+Fat%3A+How+the+Food+Giants+Hooked+Us+by+Michael+Moss","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c8835b3715c29f825b6d9e64a24267e043375f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,136,53,179,113,92,41,248,37,182,217,230,74,36,38,126,4,51,117,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
