Raleigh, N.C.-based Between the Buried and Me (BTBAM) are such a band and they present their latest exploration, Colors (Victory Records).  \n\nProduced once again by Jamie King (The Human Abstract, Beloved, Through the Eyes of the Dead) BTBAM bring even more complexity and mood from its last release Alaska.\n\nBetween the Buried and Me are challenging listeners to venture into its more complex and textured music. Do not let the mathematical tags scare you. This is a definitely an album that isn?t so out there that you can?t enjoy it. This album is definitely recommended.\n\n\n\n1.
