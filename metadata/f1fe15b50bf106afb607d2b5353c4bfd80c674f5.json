Learn how to make the physical world as programmable as the digital world with Arduino open source electronic prototyping toolkit. With this hands-on introductory workshop video, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to use the Arduino for making projects that can sense and react to the real world.\n\nNo hardware or coding experience is necessary. Arduino expert Philip Lindsay guides you through the process, and shows you cool projects that he and others have created. Once you know the basics, you too could be on your way to creating anything from a build monitoring tool to a cuddly navigation device.\n\n- Download and install the Arduino IDE on Windows, OS X, or Linux\n- Learn the items you need to participate in this hands-on workshop, and get a guided tour of an Arduino board\n- Work with an Arduino sketch (program) to get an LED light to blink at different rates\n- Use an solderless breadboard for assembling a push button input circuit\n- Modify the Arduino sketch to work with multiple LEDS\n- Make your Arduino read numbers that you send from your computer over the USB-to-Serial interface\n- Learn the steps for enabling your Arduino to display messages in text form on an LCD display, using a ready-made shield\n- With this workshop, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll start your journey on a road that leads to robots, home automation, and even space communications Ã¢â‚¬â€ all with the Arduino.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027973.do&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027973.do&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n01.Introduction and Shopping List(Get Started with Arduino A Hands-On Introductory Workshop).mp4\n02.Hands-On One- Installation (Mac OS X).mp4\n03.Hands-On One- Installation (Windows).mp4\n04.Hands-On One- Installation (Linux).mp4\n05.Hands-On One- Blink Sketch.mp4\n06.Project and Hardware Inspiration.mp4\n07.Hands-On Two- Introduction.mp4\n08.Hands-On Two- Assembling the Blink Circuit.mp4\n09.Hands-On Two- Blink Sketch Revisited and Circuit Troubleshooting.mp4\n10.Hands-On Two- Button Input Introduction.mp4\n11.Hands-On Two- Assembling the Button Circuit.mp4\n12.Hands-On Two- Button Input Sketch.mp4\n13.Hands-On Two- Input and Output Combined.mp4\n14.Hands-On Three- Introduction.mp4\n15.Hands-On Three- Assembling the Multiple LED Circuit.mp4\n16.Hands-On Three- Multiple LED Blink Sketch.mp4\n17.Hands-On Three- A Better Blink without Delay.mp4\n18.Hands-On Three- Better Sketches with Loops and Arrays not Copy and Paste.mp4\n19.Hands-On Three- Fading an LED.mp4\n20.Hands-On Three- Reading Numbers from the Serial Monitor.mp4\n21.Hands-On Three- Remembering Information when Powered Off.mp4\n22.Hands-On Four- LCD Display (Bonus Content).mp4\n23.Course Wrap Up and Conclusion.mp4\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1fe15b50bf106afb607d2b5353c4bfd80c674f5","amp;dn":"Get+Started+with+Arduino+A+Hands-On+Introductory+Workshop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1fe15b50bf106afb607d2b5353c4bfd80c674f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,254,21,181,11,241,6,175,182,7,210,181,53,60,75,253,128,198,116,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
