Authors Joshua Piven and David Borgenicht consulted numerous experts in their fields (they&quot;re cited at the end of the book) to discover how to survive various and sundry awful events. Parachute doesn&quot;t open? Your best bet for survival is to hook your arms through the straps of a fellow jumper&quot;s chute--and even then you&quot;re likely to dislocate both shoulders and break both legs. Car sinking in water? Open the window immediately to equalize pressure, then open the car door and swim to the surface. Buried in an avalanche? Spit on the snow--it will tell you which direction is really up. Then dig as fast as you can.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3705990e2b5912244b2d0e7b12d5f7c6802972d8","amp;dn":"The+Worst-Case+scenario+Survival+Handbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3705990e2b5912244b2d0e7b12d5f7c6802972d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,5,153,14,43,89,18,36,75,45,14,123,18,213,247,198,128,41,114,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
