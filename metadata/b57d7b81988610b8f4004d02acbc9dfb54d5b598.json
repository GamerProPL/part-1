Drawing upon forty years of archaeological research, award-winning scholar Toby Wilkinson takes us inside a tribal society with a pre-monetary economy and decadent, divine kings who ruled with all-too-recognizable human emotions.\r\n\r\nHere are the legendary leaders: Akhenaten, the â€œheretic king,â€ who with his wife Nefertiti brought about a revolution with a bold new religion; Their son, Tutankhamun, whose dazzling tomb would remain hidden for three millennia; and eleven pharaohs called Ramesses, the last of whom presided over the militarism, lawlessness, and corruption that caused a political and societal decline. Filled with new information and unique interpretations, The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt is a riveting and revelatory work of wild drama, bold spectacle, unforgettable characters, and sweeping history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b57d7b81988610b8f4004d02acbc9dfb54d5b598","amp;dn":"The+Rise+and+Fall+of+Ancient+Egypt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b57d7b81988610b8f4004d02acbc9dfb54d5b598","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,125,123,129,152,134,16,184,244,0,77,2,172,188,157,251,84,213,181,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
