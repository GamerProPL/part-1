The one person who reached out to her, Jessie, also happens to be part of the popular crowd that lives to torment outsiders like her. But Rachel has something else that separates her from the rest, a secret amazing ability to move things with her mind. Sue Snell, the only survivor of Carrie White's rampage twenty-two years ago, may hold the key to helping Rachel come to terms with her awesome, but unwanted power. But as Rachel slowly learns to trust, a terrible trap is being laid for her. And making her angry could prove to be fatal. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8162e3839482f4cb457802f3d7ab9fc5cca4b253","amp;dn":"The+Rage%3A+Carrie+2+%281999%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8162e3839482f4cb457802f3d7ab9fc5cca4b253","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,98,227,131,148,130,244,203,69,120,2,243,215,171,159,197,204,164,178,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
