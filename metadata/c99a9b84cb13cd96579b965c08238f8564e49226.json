Today,       \n spearfishing is a sports activity in many countries around the world,   \n especially in the UK, around the Mediterranean Sea and in South         \n America. Spearfishers hunt while diving apnea, holding their breath, so \n have to coordinate their energy carefully while monitoring their prey,  \n especially in tactically challenging hunting situations.                \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n INSTALL NOTES\n \n 1.
