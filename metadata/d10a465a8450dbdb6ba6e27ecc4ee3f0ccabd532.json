According to his website, Tomboy was slated for release &quot;near the end of 2010&quot;[5] but the album release was delayed until 2011. Lennox has mentioned Tomboy will be a departure from his signature sound on Person Pitch and Animal Collective's Merriweather Post Pavilion. About the new direction, Lennox said: &quot;I got tired of the severe parameters of using samplers. Thinking about Nirvana and The White Stripes got me into the idea of doing something with a heavy focus on guitar and rhythm.&quot;[5] The album was released in full on April 4th, streaming online,[6] and leaked online on April 5th.\n\n1. \t&quot;You Can Count on Me&quot;   \t2:33\n2. \t&quot;Tomboy&quot;   \t4:55\n3. \t&quot;Slow Motion&quot;   \t4:36\n4. \t&quot;SurferÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Hymn&quot;   \t4:10\n5. \t&quot;Last Night at the Jetty&quot;   \t4:40\n6. \t&quot;Drone&quot;   \t4:01\n7. \t&quot;Alsatian Darn&quot;   \t4:16\n8. \t&quot;Scheherazade&quot;   \t3:53\n9. \t&quot;Friendship Bracelet&quot;   \t5:54\n10. \t&quot;Afterburner&quot;   \t6:50\n11. \t&quot;Benfica&quot;   \t4:11","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d10a465a8450dbdb6ba6e27ecc4ee3f0ccabd532","amp;dn":"Panda+Bear+-+Tomboy+320+kbps+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d10a465a8450dbdb6ba6e27ecc4ee3f0ccabd532","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,10,70,90,132,80,219,219,107,166,226,126,204,78,227,240,204,171,213,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
