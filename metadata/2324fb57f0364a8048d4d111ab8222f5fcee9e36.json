Calculus 7th and Calculus ET 7th both have the same problem set as they both cover the exact same topics, only a little differently as the book titles suggest (problem numbering in each version is different for this reason). In the regular version of calculus, transcendental functions (LOG, EXP, ARC) are covered in a separate chapter *after* the derivative and integration concepts have been introduced. In the early transcendentals (ET) version, transcendental functions are treated along with regular functions as the derivative and integration concepts are being developed. Students in an engineering or physics program need the calculus handling of these special functions concurrently in some other courses of their semester curriculum, so they study them earlier than students in health or administrative sciences.\n\nNOTE1: Student solutions manual (SSM) for Calculus 7th: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9781195/Calculus_7th_edition_Stewart_c2012_Student_Solutions_Manual&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9781195/Calculus_7th_edition_Stewart_c2012_Student_Solutions_Manual&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNOTE2: This ISM will sure be useful with the coming 8th edition (Jan 2015 c2016) of this title as it is expected that some 75% of the problems found in the 7th edition will be recycled in the 8th (excluding Application Problems and Project Problems).\n\n\n***  W A R N I N G  ***\n\nMake sure you understand the perils and pitfalls of using full solutions manuals like this one.\nSee: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10954563/Calculus_Early_Transcendental_Functions_6th_Larson_solutions_ISM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10954563/Calculus_Early_Transcendental_Functions_6th_Larson_solutions_ISM&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2324fb57f0364a8048d4d111ab8222f5fcee9e36","amp;dn":"Calculus%3A+Early+Transcendentals+7th+c2012+Stewart+solutions+ISM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2324fb57f0364a8048d4d111ab8222f5fcee9e36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,36,251,87,240,54,74,128,72,212,209,17,171,130,34,245,252,238,158,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
