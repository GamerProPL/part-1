Well, Schubert drafted a four-movement 7th symphony in E major (D. 729) in August 1821 but, though the work (which comprises 1340 bars) is structurally complete, he only orchestrated the slow introduction and the first 110 bars of the first movement. Thus, it is much more &quot;unfinished&quot; than the 8th and very few orchestras perform it today for that reason. There are at least three completions of the 7th by other composers, most notably John Francis Barnett (1881), Felix Weingartner (1934) and Brian Newbould (1981).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2d8423998347242aac8551a5aa6a6dbc3728921","amp;dn":"CLASSICAL+-+Franz+Schubert%3A+The+Complete+Symphonies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2d8423998347242aac8551a5aa6a6dbc3728921","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,216,66,57,152,52,114,66,170,200,85,26,90,166,166,219,195,114,137,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
