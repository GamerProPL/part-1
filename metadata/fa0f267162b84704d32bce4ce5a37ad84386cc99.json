Ryback [epub]\r\n\r\nIn this brilliant and original exploration of some of the formative influences in Adolf Hitlerâ€™s life, Timothy Ryback examines the books that shaped the man and his thinking.\r\n\r\nHitler was better known for burning books than collecting them but, as Ryback vividly shows us, books were Hitlerâ€™s constant companions throughout his life. They accompanied him from his years as a frontline corporal during the First World War to the final days before his apparent suicide in Berlin.\r\n\r\nWith remarkable attention to detail, Ryback examines the surviving volumes from Hitlerâ€™s private book collection, revealing the ideas and obsessions that occupied Hitler in his most private hours and the consequences they had for our world.\r\n\r\nA feat of scholarly detective work, and a captivating biographical portrait, Hitlerâ€™s Private Library is one of the most intimate and chilling works on Hitler yet written","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa0f267162b84704d32bce4ce5a37ad84386cc99","amp;dn":"Hitler%27s+Private+Library%3A+The+Books+That+Shaped+His+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa0f267162b84704d32bce4ce5a37ad84386cc99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,15,38,113,98,184,71,4,211,43,206,76,229,163,122,216,67,134,204,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
