Grow a Living Wall is the first wall-gardening book to focus exclusively on the needs of home gardeners.\n\nMake your vertical garden environmentally friendly and sustainable. It's easy with author Shawna Coronado's help! One of her themed vertical gardens is stocked mostly with flowers to make it a haven for bees and other pollinators. Other gardens are filled with vegetables and herbs so anyone with an outdoor wall can grow their own food - beautifully! Even more gardens promote aromatherapy or medicinal plants. Some are designed to provide a green net of air filtration near a living area, or to protect exterior walls from exposure to direct sunlight, which helps to keep the indoors cool","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59d6a9c2dd2cc3600bf31e9416fc6a4ea3c92ccc","amp;dn":"Grow+a+Living+Wall%3A+Create+Vertical+Gardens+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59d6a9c2dd2cc3600bf31e9416fc6a4ea3c92ccc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,214,169,194,221,44,195,96,11,243,30,148,22,252,106,78,163,201,44,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
