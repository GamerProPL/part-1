Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\nThere's no official ebook version of this book; existing versions are all amateur productions, though some are good quality. I figured it would be worth having a pdf version that retains all the original formatting, pagination, etc., so I made this one.\n\ndescription:\n\nOne of the 20th centuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enduring works, One Hundred Years of Solitude is a widely beloved and acclaimed novel known throughout the world, and the ultimate achievement in a Nobel Prize-winning career.\n\nThe novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the BuendÃƒÂ­a family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the BuendÃƒÂ­a family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America.\n\nLove and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility - the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth - these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel GarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f94ec34c7bb943b039f6a67848e935fab570a64d","amp;dn":"Gabriel+Garcia+Marquez+-+One+Hundred+Years+of+Solitude+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f94ec34c7bb943b039f6a67848e935fab570a64d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,78,195,76,123,185,67,176,57,246,166,120,72,233,53,250,181,112,166,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
