Until now. The alien artifact working through its program under the clouds of Venus has appeared in Uranus's orbit, where it has built a massive gate that leads to a starless dark.\n\nJim Holden and the crew of the Rocinante are part of a vast flotilla of scientific and military ships going out to examine the artifact. But behind the scenes, a complex plot is unfolding, with the destruction of Holden at its core. As the emissaries of the human race try to find whether the gate is an opportunity or a threat, the greatest danger is the one they brought with them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38c96d673ac1dba4e887d987047cb0abb47e6e90","amp;dn":"+Abaddon%27s+Gate+by+James+S.+A.+Corey+%28The+Expanse+Book+1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38c96d673ac1dba4e887d987047cb0abb47e6e90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,201,109,103,58,193,219,164,232,135,217,135,4,124,176,171,180,126,110,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
