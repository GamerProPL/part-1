Educational : English\n\n\n\nA Huge Collection Of Over 500 Chess Books\n\nOwn the most complete chess library on the net.\n\nThe collection is in PDF and DJVU formats\n\nI have included Foxit (way better than adobe) and DJVU viewers. (You can download your own versions of these programs if you don't trust these. They are free)\n\nI have included a text index.\n\n5 or 6 of the books are in Russian.\n\nThis is a worthwhile torrent to keep alive considering it can all fit on a single DVD, and one needn't spend ages finding individual books. \n\n......so PLEASE SEED UNTIL 2019!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a8bf364a515e7f70185bc46a52b49d39f309409","amp;dn":"Chess+Books+-+A+Complete+Library+of+Over+500+Books","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a8bf364a515e7f70185bc46a52b49d39f309409","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,139,243,100,165,21,231,247,1,133,188,70,165,43,73,211,159,48,148,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
