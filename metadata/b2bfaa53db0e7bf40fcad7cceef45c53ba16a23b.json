The film features Chloe Sevigny, Leo Fitzpatrick, Justin Pierce and Rosario Dawson, most of them in their debut performances. The film is centered on a day in the life of a group of sexually active teenagers in New York City and their unrestrained behavior towards sex and drugs during the era of HIV in the mid-1990s.\n\nKids created considerable controversy upon its release in 1995, and caused much public debate over its artistic merit, even receiving an NC-17 rating from the MPAA. It was later released without a rating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this isn't seeded, I will let it die.  I will only seed those torrents which are desired.  If it is good, and you think other's will like it, please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2bfaa53db0e7bf40fcad7cceef45c53ba16a23b","amp;dn":"KIDS+%281995%29--DVD+rip--vikingsfreak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2bfaa53db0e7bf40fcad7cceef45c53ba16a23b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,191,170,83,219,14,123,244,15,202,215,204,238,244,92,83,186,22,162,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
