Despite the music, Peggy sings the same way she always did, and the songs selected here are also typical although the second album on this twofer contains some Latin songs â€“ Fantastico, Non dimenticar and Ole..\r\nMany of the songs will therefore be familiar to fans of the Great American Songbook and Broadway show tunes, right from the opening Heart (if that title doesnâ€™t mean anything, you may remember the chorus line You gotta have heart). On the street where you live, Surrey with the fringe on top, Hey there, I could have danced all night, The partyâ€™s over, I enjoy being a girl, Come dance with me, Love and marriage, You stepped out of a dream â€“ these are just some of the classic songs here. Peggyâ€™s covers are always distinctive, but the Latin style makes them even more so.\r\nTwo bonus tracks â€“ Till there was you (which has never sounded better than when sung here by Peggy) and Together wherever we go â€“ make this even more desirable than it would have been anyway.\r\nThese albums, while typical in many ways of Peggyâ€™s music, are distinctive simply because of the Latin style. For that reason, this twofer is one of the most important among the many released. (Customer from Amazon)\r\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/2wzU9l6.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n01. Heart    [1:59]\r\n02.
