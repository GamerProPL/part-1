CoreMelt Complete includes ALL 8 CoreMelt products; ImageFlow FxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ V2, PolyChrome TransitionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ V2 TRX, PolyChrome TransitionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ V2 Delta V, Pigment, Gadget, Luminous and Shatter, in total providing you with over 200 GPU accelerated plugins to kick start and floor your workflow.\n\nBack to top\n\nCYCORE SYSTEMS\nCycoreFX HD\nCycoreFX HD is the professional version of CycoreFX that allows for doing compositing and effects work at higher bit depths, HDTV and film. All plug-ins in the HD package support 16 bpc and 34 have 32 bpc support (float). CycoreFX HD also contains 12 additional plug-ins such as the more advanced Rainfall and Snowfall simulators. Rainfall and Snowfall allows to easily and quickly create \\&quot;real-looking\\&quot; rain and snow when there is no time to get into a complex particle generator. The HD package features an impressive total of 73 plug-ins. For more information and for a detailed comparison between CycoreFX HD and the bundled CycoreFX version, visit the website.\n\nCFX Path Tools\nPath Tools is a package containing two powerful plug-ins, Rakka and Wiggle Stroke. These plug-ins are targeted at creating animations based on mask paths. Rakka is a tool for handling multiple repetitions of a layer that can be animated along a mask path. Wiggle Stroke wiggles and repeats a stroke based on a mask path. Both plug-ins offer controls that allows for almost endless combinations to create anything from very basic animations to highly unique effects and background elements, even from just an ellipse or straight line mask path. Path Tools supports 32 bpc color (float). For more information, visit the website.\n\nCFX Sphere Utilities\nCFX Sphere Utilities is a set of four plug-ins designed to deal with spherical maps (equirectangular maps) commonly used to texture 3D spheres or as 3D environments. Animating layers and drawing lines on spherical maps are a breeze when Sphere Utilities handles the spherical transformations required. Animations can then be used directly in After Effects with CC Sphere, or any other plug-in that support spherical mapping, or in any 3D application. Spherical maps are also used as environment maps and for panoramic viewers, which are other sources where this kind of capability is important. Sphere Utilities supports 32 bpc color (float). For more information, visit the website.\n\nBack to top\n\nDIGIEFFECTS\nBuena Depth Cue v2\nStreamlined and strengthened, Buena Depth Cue v2 is the complete set of tools needed for 3D manipulation in After Effects.\n\nMimic Z depth in your compositions in ways that simply can\\'t be done using After Effects depth of field. With a total of 6 effects (Atmosphere, Camera Mapper, Depth, Falloff Lighting, Flipside, and Rack Focus), Buena Depth Cue v2 has capabilities that are simply not available in any other plugin package at any price.\n\nDelirium v2\nWe\\'re keeping only the best effects from the original Delirium package. And, we\\'re adding some new ones.\n\nOriginally developed in 1999, the award-winning Delirium is used by tens of thousands of video professionals worldwide. This is the plugin collection that established the standard for essential visual effects and motion graphics capabilities. Delirium v2 will continue to be a staple in the toolboxes of motion graphics and visual effects artists the world over. Now with 45 effects, this set has helped drive the edge of post production since its introduction and this visual effects favorite continues to add flexibility for new users every day. Now 64-bit compatible.\n\nDamage 2.0\nThe new standard for creating electronic defects in your footage. If you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t hold public office or if you havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t achieved pop stardom just yet, you may find it difficult to ruin your image without help. Damage is dedicated to simulating analog and digital errors and defects in your footage and it now includes two new effects: Destabilize and Overexpose.\n\nCamera Mapper\nCamera Mapper allows you to project your imagery onto multiple 3D layers to create breathtaking 3D matte paintings and expand a 2D image into full 3D perspective.\n\nFreeForm\nIncluded with After Effects CS5.\n\nFreeForm 3D Mesh Warp\nOnly interested in warping, not displacing a layer in true 3D? 3D Mesh Warp adds a third dimension to what you already do with After EffectsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ built-in Mesh Warp tool. Select how many rows and columns you divide the image into, then manipulate the control tangents to create cylinders, curves, ribbons, folding cards, an in finite amount of three dimensional shapes. Note that CS5 users do NOT need to buy this because CS5 includes all the functionality with FreeForm, which is included with After Effects CS5.\n\nFreeForm 3D Displacer\nOnly interested in using a grayscale map to displace a layer in true 3D? 3D Displacer brings true three dimensional displacement mapping to After Effects. Displacement maps can of course be animated, adding e ffects like rippling water or blowing flags in full 3D perspective ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ no faking. Use mesh subdivision to raise and lower the density of your mesh, and anti-aliasing settings to work quickly and then switch to a fully refined result. Note that CS5 users do NOT need to buy this because CS5 includes all the functionality with FreeForm, which is included with After Effects CS5.\n\nFalloff Lighting\nFalloff Lighting provides an enhanced lighting system for After Effects built-in lights from one single menu command. Falloff Lighting acts much more like real world lighting. Reflected light naturally decays or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfalls offÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as surfaces increase distance from the After Effects light.\n\nAged Film\nTurn back the clock with Aged Film and choose which era you set your shot. Priced at only $49, Aged Film is the best value for achieving this effect in todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s post production applications.\n\nAtmosphere\nSimulate atmospheric conditions such as haze and fog in your composition. Now you can add true 3 dimensional atmospheric falloff in After Effects from one single menu command. No more adding semi-transparent solids between your 3D layers to simulate fog or haze!\n\n \n\nBack to top\n\nDIGITAL ANARCHY\nBeauty Box\nIntroducing Beauty Box, the next generation in skin retouching plugins for After Effects, Final Cut Pro, and Premiere. By using advanced techniques like Face Detection, this skin retouching plugin automatically identifIES skin tones while preserving important facial features.

You can visit the Red Giant Software section on this page for product information or visit the Digital Anarchy acquisition FAQ section on the Red Giant Software site.\n\n \n\nBack to top\n\nDIGITAL FILM TOOLS\nComposite Suite Pro\nComposite Suite includes visual effects plug-ins that were until recently, available only in-house at a Los Angeles film effects facility. The Composite Suite plug-ins include everything needed to combine multiple images: color correction, blur, grain, matte manipulation, and edge blending. The set features a well-rounded collection of compositing plug-ins such as Composite, Drop Shadow, Edge Composite, Holdout Composite, Light Wrap, Math Composite, Non-Additive Mix, and Optical Dissolve, as well as specialized tools for combining imagery such as fire, smoke, and explosions. There are also many indispensable and useful tools such as Glows, DVE, Matte Generator, Matte Repair, Film Masks, HDTV Masks, Grain, Blurs, Defocus, Distortion, Deartifact, a variety of color correctors, and Light! for creating natural lighting effects.\n\nPower Matte\nPower Matte is an easy to use interactive image matting tool capable of extracting almost any object in an image ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ even if you are dealing with fine hair detail, smoke, or reflections. This extraction process creates what is known as a matte ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ essentially a black and white cutout. White matte areas are extracted, black areas not, and gray areas in between represent a level of transparency. Once a matte is extracted, the foreground object can be seamlessly composed onto a new background as well as apply filter and image corrections only within the area defined by the matte.\n\nPower Stroke\nDesigned with the creative workflow of colorists, film/video editors, graphic designers and artists in mind, Power Stroke introduces a simple, interactive stroke-based workflow to quickly and intuitively perform targeted adjustments. Instead of meticulously drawing exact masks, using inaccurate matte extractions or hand painting frame to frame, regions of interest are isolated by drawing a few simple and loose After Effects open or closed masks. Masks can be assigned multiple corrections and effects such as color correction, recoloring or desaturation, colorization of black and white images, blur, fill light for dimly lit image areas and diffusion/glow.\n\nZmatte\nzMatte is a full-featured blue and green-screen keyer. Using proprietary matte extraction techniques and 16-bit processing, zMatte quickly and simply creates mattes with minimal parameters even if you are dealing with fine hair detail, smoke, or reflections. It is easy to use, yet provides the needed tools when faced with good, bad, or ugly shots ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ tools such as multiple matte creation, automatic spill suppression, sophisticated matte and edge manipulation, and color correction. Visit the website for more information and a free demo.\n\n \n\nBack to top\n\nTHE FOUNDRY\nCameraTracker\nThe Foundry\\'s camera tracker for After Effects allows you to pull 3D motion tracks and matchmoves without having to leave After Effects. It analyzes the source sequence and extracts the original camera\\'s lens and motion parameters, allowing you to composite 2D or 3D elements correctly with reference to the camera used to film the shot.\n\nYou can now match camera moves within Adobe After Effects\\' 2.5D environment, opening up new, robust options for the placement of composite elements, such as the creation of Fringe / Heroes style \\'in scene\\' titles, insertion of animated design elements, match-moved virtual set extensions, motion-tracked projection mapping and much more.\n\nKronos 5.0: GPU Accelerated Retiming\nThe Foundry has created a Hollywood quality CUDA GPU accelerated retiming plug-in based on their Academy AwardÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®-winning FURNACE algorithms: KRONOS 5.0. Use KRONOS for retiming, speed-ramping, time-remapping and slow-motion effects, plus the addition of realistic motion blur.\n\nRetiming is useful when you have to make something fit an allotted time segment, or want to creatively move in \\&quot;super slow-motion\\&quot;.\n\nRolling Shutter\nRolling shutter effects are commonly found with video cameras employing CMOS image sensors, which record every frame line-by-line from top to bottom of the image, rather than as a single snapshot of a point in time.\n\nAs parts of the image are recorded at different times, fast-moving objects, or objects that pass quickly through frame during camera whip-pans, become distorted with diagonal skews. Other typical distortions include image wobbles created when cameras are hand-held, and exposure problems with flashing or strobing lights.\n\nAlong with being ungainly and unwanted, these image distortions also increase the difficulty of 3D tracking during VFX post production, as the tracking points themselves can be equally affected or not deliver accurate results.\n\nUsing Local Motion Estimation technology, we can individually correct parts of the image that are moving relative to the camera, even if they are moving in different directions or at different speeds.\n\n \n\nBack to top\n\nFRISCHLUFT.COM\nFlair\nFlair brings 8 high quality effects to Adobe After Effects and Photoshop compatible programs. Among them shine, glow and sparkle effects. Of course with 16bit and multi CPU support.\n\nFreshCurves\nCurves are a very versatile and precise color correction tool. The native After Effects version lacks control and accuracy to take full advantage of it. Fresh Curves makes up for these drawbacks so you can get the most out of this basic tool.\n\nLenscare\nLenscare moves depth of field and out of focus generation to post production. If you need high quality camera blurs with the flexibility of 2d post processing, Lenscare is a great choice. It can get you rid of long extra 3d rendering times. The key aspect during the development of these filters was to match the real thing as good as possible. Lenscare is available as plugins for Adobe After Effects and Photoshop compatible programs.\n\nLensfeed\nLensfeed shows a camera\\'s live preview inside After Effects. No still frames but a moving live feed! Lensfeed is implemented as regular After Effects filters so the livefeed is displayed inside compositions and can can be treated like regular footage.\n\nZBornToy\nOur debut product is made to lead a line of tools that introduce a new meaning to depth in compositing. The ZbornToy has the ability to extract a maximum of information out of simple depth images and allows you to not only light and texture them, but to refract backgrounds, cast caustic reflection back onto the background and a whole lot more.\n\n \n\nBack to top\n\nGENARTS\nSapphire Plug-ins\n20/20 vision for your mindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eye.

RE:Fill can replace missing pixels in numerous ways, for example, by selecting the nearest ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ pixel, mirroring pixels around a hole\\'s edge, or cloning from another ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ region. And the good region can even come from another point in time or from another sequence altogether.\n\nRE:Fill is a plug-in that works in both After Effects and Adobe Premiere.\n\nRE:Flex\nRE:Flex brings intuitive morphing and warping directly to After Effects 5.0 or later. Achieve superior results using proprietary and sophisticated technology. RE:Flex is especially easy to learn because it uses the host program\\'s own drawing and masking tools to direct the warping and morphing, so there\\'s no need to learn a whole new user interface.\n\nRE:Flex, which uses RE:Vision\\'s proprietary tracking software, is the first morphing program to combine hand feature matching with automatic image registration.\n\nReelSmart Motion Blur\nAutomatically add more natural-looking motion blur to a sequence using ReelSmart Motion Blur. RE:Vision\\'s tracking technology is at the heart of ReelSmart Motion Blur, so no handwork is involved. Of course, you can add as little or as much blurring as you need, and even remove motion blur. Finally, you can create interesting effects by blurring one sequence by using the motion from another. ReelSmart MotionBlur is useful for the following:\n\nReduce strobing in sequences ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ particularly useful when frame rates of video are changed after digitizing. ReelSmart Motion Blur has fewer artifacts than other methods such as frame blending.\nAutomatically smooth the jerkiness of hand-drawn and scanned animations.\nMotion-blur complex 3D animations when your 3D system takes too much time; in many cases, ReelSmart Motion Blur will be much faster and just as effective.\nMotion-blur one sequence using another sequence\\'s motion for unique effects.\nSharpen image sequences by removing motion blur.\nShade/Shape\nGive your imagery volume and depth without the hassle of 3D modeling. ReelSmart Shade/Shape generates 3D models from your 2D graphical and picture elements using RE:Vision\\'s powerful and proprietary shading-from-shape technology. The models are then lit and rendered in true 3D. Add further detailing to your 3D models by applying reflection and bump maps. As 2D elements merge and split in a sequence, ReelSmart Shade/Shape automatically merges and splits the geometry in an intuitive fashion. Features include automatic 3D model creation, 3D lighting and rendering, bump mapping, environment mapping, and stable and smooth-over-time shading produced for moving imagery.\n\nSmoothKit\nSmoothKit provides the ultimate filter set to smooth your imagery by combining user-directed controls and feature-sensitive methods.\n\nThis set of filters complements the basic blurs provided by host applications. SmoothKit\\'s emphasis is precise control of the filtering process with no compromise on image quality. For example, SmoothKit has a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrealÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ compound blur that exhibits no blocky artifacts. In addition to effects, the SmoothKit toolset can be used to reduce image defects in a much more intelligent manner.\n\nSmoothKit is a plug-in that works in both After Effects and Adobe Premiere.\n\nTwixtor\nTwixtor enables you to speed up, slow down, or use frame-rate conversion on image sequences with visually stunning results. To achieve its unparalleled image quality, Twixtor synthesizes unique new frames by warping and interpolating frames of the original. Features include:\n\nCalculation of motion vectors at each pixel\nWarping and interpolation of frames to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtime warpÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ input footage\nSmart processing of fields in the input and output as appropriate\nStretching of a sequence using a single scaling parameter\nKeyframable retiming for complete control on a frame-by-frame basis\nFrame-rate conversions made easy (supported only in After Effects)\nVideo Gogh\nThe Video Gogh plug-in transforms images and video into painted works of art. Video Gogh is different from other paint filters because it can actually track objects in movies for an unparalleled smooth result. Features include three styles of brush strokes, variably sized strokes, variable distance between strokes (so there can be empty space between strokes), and various translucent brushes. All of the brush stroke effects can be animated, with the ability to leave masked layers unaffected by special effects.
