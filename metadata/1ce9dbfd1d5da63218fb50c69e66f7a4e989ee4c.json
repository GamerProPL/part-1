She did not consider herself a philosopher but had a significant influence on both feminist existentialism and feminist theory.  Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, an autobiography and monographs on philosophy, politics and social issues.  She is best known for her 1949 treatise THE SECOND SEX, a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary feminism, which is here presented in two translations.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n* BRIGITTE BARDOT AND THE LOLITA SYNDROME (Four Square Books, 1960).
