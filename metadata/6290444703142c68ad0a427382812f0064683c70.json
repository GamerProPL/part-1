This works on vista and 7. And it\\\\\\'s always nice to support BioWare, Obsidian Entertainment and Lucas Arts.\n\nPlease seed it if you like it, or leave a comment down below.\n\nNote: Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords can be found on my profile.\n\n- - - - -\n\nREADME.TXT\n\nA guide to installing Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic I and II on Windows Vista/7, by Deep92 aka Crowding.\nContact: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;2665544951424f484166414b474f4a0845494b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; - I actually do read this.\n\n1 ) Load the CD(s) (either the actual ones, or an image/iso file through Daemon tools or alike).\n\n2 ) Right click the disc and press \\\\\\&quot;Explore\\\\\\&quot; or \\\\\\&quot;Open\\\\\\&quot;, so you can see the directories and files on the disc.\n\n3a) Right click \\\\\\&quot;setup.exe\\\\\\&quot; and press \\\\\\&quot;Properties\\\\\\&quot;.\n3b) Select the compatibility tab on top and check \\\\\\&quot;Run this program in compatibility mode for:\\\\\\&quot;. On the dropdown list select \\\\\\&quot;Windows XP (Service Pack 2)\\\\\\&quot;. Also make sure you check the \\\\\\&quot;Run this program as an administrator\\\\\\&quot; box.\n\t*Note: If the option \\\\\\&quot;Run this program as an administrator\\\\\\&quot; is grayed out, it means you\\\\\\'re already logged in as one. This fine, just leave it unchecked if this is the case.\n\n4 ) Run the \\\\\\&quot;setup.exe\\\\\\&quot; and install as you would normally. (Obviously, do not run the game after installation)\n\n5a) There is a folder called \\\\\\&quot;Extras\\\\\\&quot; in these files. Open this and look for \\\\\\&quot;patch.exe\\\\\\&quot;.\n5b) Run this as you ran the installer (step 3a and 3b)\n\n6 ) Now, go to your installation directory. (Standard directory would be \\\\\\&quot;C:\\\\\\\\Program Files\\\\\\\\LucasArts\\\\\\\\SWKotOR\\\\\\&quot; (Or \\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\SWKotOR2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;), I think) Right click it, press \\\\\\&quot;Properties\\\\\\&quot; and uncheck the \\\\\\&quot;Read-only\\\\\\&quot; box. (I\\\\\\'m actually unsure as if this matters, but it can\\\\\\'t hurt to do it, now can it?)\n\n7a) Look for a file called \\\\\\&quot;Mss32.dll\\\\\\&quot; in your installation directory (the root directory, possibly \\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\SWKotOR\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;). Back this one up (either save it somewhere safe, or just rename it)\n\t*Note: A back-up is present in the \\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\Extras\\\\\\\\BACKUPS\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; folder you downloaded, just in case.\n7b) Now look for a file named the same, in the \\\\\\&quot;Extras\\\\\\&quot; folder. \n7c) Move this to your installation directory. When, and if, asked to overwrite, choose to do so.\n\n8a) Go to your installation directory. Back-up or rename \\\\\\&quot;swkotor.exe\\\\\\&quot; (or \\\\\\&quot;swkotor2.exe\\\\\\&quot;).\n\t*Note: A back-up is present in the \\\\\\&quot;\\\\\\\\Extras\\\\\\\\BACKUPS\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; folder you downloaded, just in case.\n\t\n8b) If you\\\\\\'re using the original discs, use the \\\\\\&quot;swkotor.exe\\\\\\&quot; (or \\\\\\&quot;swkotor2.exe\\\\\\&quot;) file in the \\\\\\&quot;Extras\\\\\\&quot; folder.\n\tIf you\\\\\\'re using the images provided with this download, which you probably are, then use the executable from the \\\\\\&quot;No-CD Crack\\\\\\&quot; folder.\n8c) Again, move this to the installation directory. When, and if, asked to overwrite, choose to do so again.\n\n9 ) Right click the new swkotor.exe (or swkotor2.exe) and choose \\\\\\&quot;Properties\\\\\\&quot;. Again, repeat steps 3a and 3b on the compatibility tab.\n\n10) Last, right click \\\\\\&quot;swkotor.exe\\\\\\&quot; (or \\\\\\&quot;swkotor2.exe\\\\\\&quot;) once more. Choose \\\\\\&quot;Send to &gt; Desktop (Create Shortcut)\\\\\\&quot;.\n\t*Note: Important is that you ALWAYS start the game through the swkotor.exe (or swkotor2.exe, you know it by now, right?). The launcher.exe is what it usually starts it with, but it\\\\\\'s not good after all your changes and such. Don\\\\\\'t use it, just don\\\\\\'t.\n\t\nThat\\\\\\'s it. You just succesfully installed your game. Please note that if you used the No-CD Crack, I am unsure of crashes that may occur while you play. The other one may or may not be more stable. I did not test anything, I just wrote this readme because the original posts were a mess.\n\n - - - - - - - -\n\nSpecial thanks to:\n\tAstrotoy7, member from the Lucas Forums - Original writer of the vista/7 fix walkthrough.\n\tQ, member from the Lucas Forums - The one that worked out the details on the above post.
