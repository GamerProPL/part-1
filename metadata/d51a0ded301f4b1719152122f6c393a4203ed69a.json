His exploits as a piano-thumping, egocentric wild man with an unquenchable thirst for living have become the fodder for numerous biographies, film documentaries, and a full-length Hollywood movie. Certainly few other artists came to the party with more ego and talent than he and lived to tell the tale. And certainly even fewer could successfully channel that energy into their music and prosper doing it as well as Jerry Lee. When he broke on the national scene in 1957 with his classic &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On,&quot; he was every parents' worst nightmare perfectly realized: a long, blonde-haired Southerner who played the piano and sang with uncontrolled fury and abandon, while simultaneously reveling in his own sexuality. He was rock &amp; roll's first great wild man and also rock &amp; roll's first great eclectic. Ignoring all manner of musical boundaries is something that has not only allowed his music to have wide variety, but to survive the fads and fashions as well. Whether singing a melancholy country ballad, a lowdown blues, or a blazing rocker, Lewis' wholesale commitment to the moment brings forth performances that are totally grounded in his personality and all singularly of one piece. Like the recordings of Hank Williams, Louis Armstrong, and few others, Jerry Lee's early recorded work is one of the most amazing collections of American music in existence.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Whole Lot Of Shakin' Going On\n02.Great Balls Of Fire\n03.You Win Again\n04.Breathless\n05.High School Confidential\n06.What'd I Say\n07.What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made A Loser Out Of Me)\n08.Another Place Another Time\n09.She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left Of Me)\n10.To Make Love Sweeter For You\n11.Don't Let Me Cross Over\n12.One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart)\n13.She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye\n14.Once More With Feeling\n15.There Must Be More To Love Than This\n16.Me And Bobby McGee\n17.Would You Take Another Chance On Me\n18.Chantilly Lace\n19.Sometimes A Memory Ain't Enough\n20.Drinking Wine Spo-Dee O'Dee\n21.He Can't Fill My Shoes\n22.Middle Age Crazy\n23.Over The Rainbow\n24.Thirty-Nine And Holding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n               \n               ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed.
