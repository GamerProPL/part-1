John Porter (Richard Armitage), the main character of the first series, is captured by Latif's men while trying to figure out Latif's plan. Section 20 sends Michael Stonebridge (Philip Winchester) and Damian Scott (Sullivan Stapleton) to find and rescue Porter and uncover Latif's plans. Their first lead sends the team to a hotel in India, which is later seized by terrorists. Winchester added &quot;[Section 20] are trying to figure out whether or not he has his hands on WMDs or he knows where they are or whether it is a ploy to try and distract everyone from something else he is doing.&quot; The search for Latif also leads Section 20 to other worldwide locations, including Cape Town, Sudan, Kosovo and Vienna.\n\n\nList of Episodes:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=685571#pid685571&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=685571#pid685571&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFormat :\t\tXviD\nFile size:  \t\t550 MiB avg. per episode\nDuration : \t\t58 min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t\t624 pixels\nHeight : \t\t352 pixels\nAspect ratio :  \t16:9\nFrame rate :    \t25 fps\nAudio:  \t\tMP3\nNr. of Files:\t\t10 + 2 Teaser + 1 txt = 13\n\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original file names intact.\nThis pack wouldn't have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++VTV+++scenebalance+++TorrentDay+++eztv+++\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n\n######################  You like your show in one pack?  ########################\n##############################  Here you go!  ###################################\nVISIT THE KABLAM!!! at SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17577761f89d15f1c6abafec0c1cfaf08d0c71f2","amp;dn":"Strike+Back%3A+Project+Dawn+-+Season+2+HDTV+%28XviD%2FMP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17577761f89d15f1c6abafec0c1cfaf08d0c71f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,87,119,97,248,157,21,241,198,171,175,236,12,28,250,240,141,12,113,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
