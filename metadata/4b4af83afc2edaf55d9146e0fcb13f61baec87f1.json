Repeated attempts to have a stable relationship with Karen, also for the sake of their daughter Becca, fail because of their extreme libertarian infidelity. Hank's sexual appetite also infects talent agent Charlie Runkle, who indulges in all kinds of naughtiness too. More 'victims of hormones' contribute to the lustily lust-loaded plot.\n\nThe sixth season is currently on air and features a storyline revolving around Hank penning a musical with a &quot;coked up rock star&quot;. The sixth season features Marilyn Manson as himself, a friend of fellow rockstar Atticus Fetch. Season Six started on January 13, 2013, and had a season finale on March 31st.\n\nIMDb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0904208/\nWikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Californication_(TV_series)\n\n\nAll 12 episodes are full quality 720p HDTV x264 rips.\n\nEnjoy &amp; seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b4af83afc2edaf55d9146e0fcb13f61baec87f1","amp;dn":"Californication+Season+6+Complete+720p+by+TommyJay","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b4af83afc2edaf55d9146e0fcb13f61baec87f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,74,248,58,252,46,218,245,93,145,70,224,252,177,63,97,186,236,135,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
