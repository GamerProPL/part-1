A moody, electro-pop singer/songwriter in the vein of Lorde and Ellie Goulding, Halsey has a resounding voice with just a dusting of grit. Badlands feels so ripped from her personal journalâ€”â€œI write songs about sex and being sad. I will never be anything but honest,â€ reads her Instagram bioâ€”that one connects instantly with her freedom and vulnerability. And when she speaks truth on â€œCastleâ€ and â€œNew Americana,â€ itâ€™s like the graduation speech youâ€™ve always wanted to hear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Castle (4:37)\r\n2. Hold Me Down (3:24)\r\n3.
