They also re-enact scenes from their favorite movies. They were homeschooled by their mother and confined to their sixteenth story four-bedroom apartment in the Seward Park Extension housing project. Their father, Oscar, had the only door key and prohibited the kids and their mother Susanne from leaving the apartment except for a few strictly-monitored trips on the &quot;nefarious&quot; streets. \r\nEverything changed for them when 15-year-old Mukunda decided to walk around the neighborhood in January 2010, against their father's instruction to remain inside. All the brothers then decided to begin exploring Manhattan and the world outside.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/92/The-Wolfpack-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8b/The-Wolfpack-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a4/The-Wolfpack-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/45/The-Wolfpack-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f1/The-Wolfpack-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b1/The-Wolfpack-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e8/The-Wolfpack-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8d/The-Wolfpack-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ad/The-Wolfpack-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ac/The-Wolfpack-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e0/The-Wolfpack-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d3/The-Wolfpack-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video: Bitrate: CRF-22 (~2901 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 90 mins,\r\n * Framerate: 23.974 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.91 GB\r\n * Source: BluRay\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \r\n * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wolfpack en.wikipedia.org]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97fe7bfe67f9c187c9b2e76137a00c2da7df058f","amp;dn":"The+Wolfpack+720p+Bluray+x264+AAC+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97fe7bfe67f9c187c9b2e76137a00c2da7df058f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,254,123,254,103,249,193,135,201,178,231,97,55,160,12,45,167,223,5,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
