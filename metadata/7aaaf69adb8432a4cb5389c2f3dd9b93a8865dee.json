The second section addresses issues relating to\tmind, heart and spirit, with chapters on finding the lover within, keeping the flame alive, sex and shame, sex as improv and creative play, eroticizing safer sex, and fantasy, role play and communication. The third and final section takes up advanced skills and 'special treats,' with chapters on extended female orgasm, non-ejaculatory male orgasm, female ejaculation, 'Bondassage' (a gently kinky form of massage), Tantra and energy sex.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a mix of need-to-know information and Jedi-like capabilities that anyone can learn.Contributors include the legendary porn actress Nina Hartley and her husband, the master dominant Ernest Greene; Joseph Kramer, the creator of Sexological Bodywork; Sheri Winston; the award-winning sex educator and medical professional; Charles Muir, who is widely credited with bringing Tantra to the West; and fourteen other masterful 'sexperts.' isn't only a book about how to have amazing sex.
