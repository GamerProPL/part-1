Unlike many economists who claim there is only one way of 'doing economics', he introduces readers to a wide range of economic theories, from classical to Keynesian, revealing how they all have their strengths, weaknesses and blind spots. By ignoring the received wisdom, and exposing the myriad forces that shape our financial fate, Chang provides the tools that every responsible citizen needs to understand - and address - our current economic woes.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5055234d4b52f12309b54a45057c25c3d6980c17","amp;dn":"Economics%3A+The+User%27s+Guide%3A+A+Pelican+Introduction+%282014%29epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5055234d4b52f12309b54a45057c25c3d6980c17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,85,35,77,75,82,241,35,9,181,74,69,5,124,37,195,214,152,12,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
