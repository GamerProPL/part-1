Sheâ€™s still in the marital home â€“ a dilapidated, priceless London townhouse â€“ but not with John. Instead, sheâ€™s with his brother, the profoundly banal Claude, and the two of them have a plan. But there is a witness to their plot: the inquisitive, nine-month-old resident of Trudyâ€™s womb. Told from a perspective unlike any other, Nutshell is a classic tale of murder and deceit from one of the worldâ€™s master storytellers.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05b3c6159d41524caeafbb9cabdd529ac58b0af1","amp;dn":"Nutshell+-+Ian+McEwan+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI+AZW3%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05b3c6159d41524caeafbb9cabdd529ac58b0af1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,179,198,21,157,65,82,76,174,175,187,156,171,221,82,154,197,139,10,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
