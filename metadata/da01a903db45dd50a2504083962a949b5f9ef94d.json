Domesticated cats, our most familiar furry friends, bring forth a unique blend of trials for artists trying to replicate their features accurately. The incredible range of breeds, colors, sizes and shapes is further enhanced by the never-ending poses each can assume, from sitting and sleeping to working and fighting. Each cat is, at best, an individual, and bringing forth those special aspects of each animal's character will make any artist's drawings come to life. Artist Melvyn Petterson offers advice for capturing the essence of these animals, both young and old, pedigreed and mixed, along with tips for portraying their features accurately, drawing fur in different media, and mastering a range of poses. * A practical guide to capturing one's cat on paper, with easy-to-follow step-by-step instructions * Covers all aspects of drawing cats in different media, including charcoal, graphite pencil, watercolor pencils and oil pastels * Illustrated with an inspiring collection of cat drawings that will appeal to artists and animal lovers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da01a903db45dd50a2504083962a949b5f9ef94d","amp;dn":"Cats%3A+How+to+Draw+Them+%28Pocket+Drawing%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da01a903db45dd50a2504083962a949b5f9ef94d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,1,169,3,219,69,221,80,162,80,64,131,150,42,148,155,95,158,249,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
