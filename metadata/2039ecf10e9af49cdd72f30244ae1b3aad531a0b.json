She published her first book in 1963 and has since published over forty novels, as well as a number of plays and novellas, and many volumes of short stories, poetry, and nonfiction.  She has won many awards for her writing, including the National Book Award, two O. Henry Awards, the National Humanities Medal, the Prix Femina Etranger, the Pushcart Prize, and the PEN/Malamud Award for &quot;a lifetime of literary achievement.&quot;\n\nJohn Updike wrote of her: &quot;She has, I fear, rather overwhelmed the puny, mean-minded critical establishment of this country.  Single-mindedness and efficiency rather than haste underlie her prolificacy; if the phrase 'woman of letters' existed, she would be, foremost in this country, entitled to it.&quot;\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format unless otherwise noted:\n\n\n                                 == Novels ==\n\n* The Accursed (2013)\n* Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart (1990) -- PDF + ePUB\n* Bellefleur (1980)\n* A Bloodsmoor Romance (1982)\n* Black Girl / White Girl (2006) -- PDF + ePUB\n* Blonde (2000) -- PDF\n* Broke Heart Blues (1999)\n* Carthage (2014)\n* Daddy Love (2013)\n* Expensive People (1968)\n* The Falls (2004)\n* A Garden of Earthly Delights (1967)\n* The Gravedigger's Daughter (2007)\n* I'll Take You There (2002) -- PDF + ePUB\n* Little Bird of Heaven (2009)\n* Middle Age: A Romance (2001) -- PDF + ePUB\n* Missing Mom (2005)\n* Mudwoman (2012)\n* My Sister, My Love (2008)\n* The Tattooed Girl (2003) -- PDF\n* We Were the Mulvaneys (1996)\n* Zombie (1995)\n\n\n                             == Short Story Collections ==\n\n* Black Dahlia &amp; White Rose (2012)\n* The Corn Maiden &amp; Other Nightmare (2011)\n* Dear Husband (2009) -- PDF + ePUB\n* Evil Eye: Four Novellas of Love Gone Wrong (2013)\n* Faithless: Tales of Transgression (2001) -- PDF + ePUB\n* Give Me Your Heart: Tales of Mystery and Suspense (2011)\n* High Lonesome: New &amp; Selected Stories, 1966-2006 (2006) -- PDF\n* I Am No One You Know: Stories (2004)\n* Lovely, Dark, Deep (2014)\n* The Museum of Dr. Moses: Tales of Mystery and Suspense (2007) -- PDF\n* Sourland: Stories (2010)\n* Wild Nights!
