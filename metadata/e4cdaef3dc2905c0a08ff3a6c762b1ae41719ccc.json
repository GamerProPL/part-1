Clemens wrote under the pen name Mark Twain and went on to pen several novels, including two major classics of American literature, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. He was also a riverboat pilot, journalist, lecturer, entrepreneur and inventor.\n\nWriting grand tales about Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn, and the mighty Mississippi River, Mark Twain explored the American soul with wit, buoyancy, and a sharp eye for truth. He became nothing less than a national treasure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4cdaef3dc2905c0a08ff3a6c762b1ae41719ccc","amp;dn":"Mark+Twain+E-Book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4cdaef3dc2905c0a08ff3a6c762b1ae41719ccc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,205,174,243,220,41,5,192,160,143,243,166,199,98,177,174,65,113,156,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
