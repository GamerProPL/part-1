Some two and a half years after the release of his Mercury nominated debut album Panic Prevention, Jamie Treays is set to cement his status as one of the UK's most genuine and exciting young musicians with the release of this album. Kings &amp; Queens is exactly the album that Jamie T's admirers hoped he would make... full of the gutter poetry, anger and humor of the first album. But tougher, more focused, more confident... and with even better tunes. Jamie is happy with his work, and typically defiant and self-deprecating in his ambitions for it.\n\nTracks:\n\n01  368\n02  Hocus Pocus\n03  Sticks 'N' Stones\n04  The Man's Machine\n05  Emily's Heart\n06  Chaka Demus\n07  Spider's Web\n08  Castro Dies\n09  Earth, Wind &amp; Fire\n10  British Intelligence\n11  Jilly Armeen\n\nEnjoy, SvC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1fb43d2edd68cb59cbb2780b11264f09e7d5f3a","amp;dn":"Jamie+T+-+Kings+%26+Queens+%5B2009-mp3-vbr%5D+%5BSvC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1fb43d2edd68cb59cbb2780b11264f09e7d5f3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,251,67,210,237,214,140,181,156,187,39,128,177,18,100,240,158,125,95,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
