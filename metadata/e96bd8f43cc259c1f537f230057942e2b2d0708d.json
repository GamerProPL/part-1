It gave him Ã¢â‚¬Å“a lovely sense of power.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nHe started out writing and directing plays for a fringe theater company he formed in London, producing works such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Frankenstein in Love,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The History of the Devil,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Colossus,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a play about his favorite painter, Goya. These plays often delved into the erotic, the fantastical, and the horrific, themes that he would later become known for in his literary work. Many of his plays have been collected in two books, Incarnations and Forms of Heaven.\n\nIn his spare time, Barker wrote short horror fiction, not expecting to be able to sell it. However, the first publisher he showed it to asked for more, and his stories were published in three volumes in 1984, under the title, The Books of Blood. Moderately successful in Great Britain, the Books found wide critical acclaim in the United States, and now appear in over a dozen languages.\n\nAbarat\nAbarat 2_ Days of Magic Nights of War\nAbarat: Absolute Midnight\nAnimal Life\nBooks of Blood Omnibus\nBooks of Blood Vol. 1\nBooks of Blood Vol. 2\nBooks of Blood Vol. 3\nBooks of Blood Vol. 4\nBooks of Blood Vol. 5\nBooks of Blood Vol. 6\nCabal\nClive Barker's Dread Screenplay\nClive Barker First Tales\nClive Barker's Age of Desire\nColdheart Canyon A Hollywood Ghost Story\nComplete Books Of Blood\nCreature\nDark Delicacies: Original Tales of Terror and the Macabre (Anthology)\nDarkness: Two Decades of Modern Horror (Anthology)\nDown Satan\nGalilee\nHellraiser A Screenplay By Clive Barker\nHellraiser Prelude\nImajica II_ The Reconciliation\nImajica I_ The Fifth Dominion\nLost Souls\nThe Mammoth Book of the Best of Best New Horror (Anthology)\nMister B.
