Santagata brings together a vast body of Italian scholarship on Danteâ€™s medieval world, untangles a complex web of family and political relationships for English readers, and shows how the composition of the Commedia was influenced by local and regional politics.\r\n\r\nSantagata traces Danteâ€™s attempts to establish himself in Florentine society as a man of both letters and action. He raises the intriguing possibility that Dante translated an illness, thought by some to be epilepsy, into an intensely physical phenomenology of love in the Vita Nova. Most importantly, Santagata highlights Danteâ€™s constant need to readjust his political stanceâ€•his involvement with the pro-Papacy Guelph faction as well as his network of patronsâ€•in response to unfolding events. Linking these shifts to the changing ethical and political convictions expressed in the Commedia, Santagata reveals the paradoxical achievement of Danteâ€™s masterpiece: a unified, universal poem nonetheless intimately entwined with the day-to-day dealings of its author.\r\n\r\nThe most striking facet of Danteâ€™s personality was a belief in his unique destiny. In every aspect of his lifeâ€•his birth under the sign of Gemini, falling in love with Beatrice, banishment from Florenceâ€•Dante glimpsed the shadow of his fate. This idea, cultivated by the poet in his youth, grew into the conviction that God had invested him with the prophetic mission of saving humanity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4f09ece445ddf929df2503a402656c19a225539","amp;dn":"Dante%3A+The+Story+of+His+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4f09ece445ddf929df2503a402656c19a225539","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,240,158,206,68,93,223,146,157,242,80,58,64,38,86,193,154,34,85,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
