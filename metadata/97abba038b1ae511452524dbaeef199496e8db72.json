Author Ray Villalobos shows how to propagate and register events during the capturing and bubbling phases, cancel an event or default behavior, and respond to clicks, mouse-overs, right-clicks, following the mouse, and loading images. Plus, Ray demos an audio jukebox project and a drag-and-drop game that shows JavaScript desktop and touch events in action.\nTopics include:\n\n    Understanding event registration and propagation\n    Analyzing event properties\n    Creating and removing DOM elements with events\n    Removing an event\n    Canceling and preventing default events\n    Playing media events\n    Handling media pauses\n    Dragging and dropping\n    Adding touch events\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97abba038b1ae511452524dbaeef199496e8db72","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+JavaScript+Events","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97abba038b1ae511452524dbaeef199496e8db72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,171,186,3,139,26,229,17,69,37,36,219,174,239,25,148,150,232,219,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
