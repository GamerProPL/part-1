Her books have enjoyed huge success in many parts of the world, and have sold over 600 million copies.\n\nOne of Blyton's most widely known characters is Noddy, intended for early years readers. However, her main work is the genre of young readers' novels in which children have their own adventures with minimal adult help. Series of this type include The Famous Five (21 novels, 1942Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1963, based on four children and their dog), The Five Find-Outers and Dog (15 novels, 1943Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1961, where five children regularly solve crimes before the local police), as well as The Secret Seven (15 novels, 1949Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1963, a society of seven children who solve various mysteries). She also wrote some lesser known poems and books.\n\nHer work involves children's adventure stories, and fantasy, sometimes involving magic. Her books were and still are enormously popular throughout the Commonwealth and across most of the globe. Her work has been translated into nearly 90 languages and her literary output was of an estimated 800 books over roughly 40 years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46b2f089b13c5bc53eb221e84ae0a916ae2f18da","amp;dn":"Enid+Blyton+E-Book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46b2f089b13c5bc53eb221e84ae0a916ae2f18da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,178,240,137,177,60,91,197,62,178,33,232,74,224,169,22,174,47,24,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
