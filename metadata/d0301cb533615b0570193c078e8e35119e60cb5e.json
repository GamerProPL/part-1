I feel overwhelmed by the information.&quot;\n\n&quot;I've bought all the CBT-style videos and books, and have even been on a course, but I don't feel ready to take the exam and I don't know if I ever will.&quot;\n\nFor every ten students who start out towards the CCNA qualification, nine quit. They don't quit because of laziness but because they became overwhelmed with information and didn't even know where to start. They sat down to study from one of the 'big name' manuals and half an hour later found themselves staring blankly at the same page. Can you imagine how frustrating that feels?\n\nYou see, most authors throw you in at the deep end and expect you to get on with it. They forget that you have a full time job, a long journey back home, family commitments and any number of challenges going on in your life. The last thing you have time for is to write out a detailed study plan with plenty of review sessions.\n\nIf only somebody could tell you what to study each day, every day. If only you could open your study guide and see which bit of theory to read, which lab to do and which exam to take. You could then get on with the task of studying and getting that exam nailed.\n\nThis is where Cisco CCNA in 60 Days comes in. Written in response to feedback from thousands of students using my online CCNA in 60 days program, my classroom courses and my other online Cisco training websites this book is the final piece in the studying puzzle.\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n------------\n\nEvery day you read your theory module, you review yesterdays lesson, do a lab and then answer some review questions.\n\nThe next day you do the same until you reach the review sessions where you cement all your knowledge with more labs and review as well as some practice exams. If that wasn't enough, you have a cram guide to read daily and an online Subnetting review site to really hone your subnetting skills.\n\nAt the 30 day mark you can take your CCENT exam and move into your ICND2 study sessions or just take your CCNA exam at the end of 60 days. If you fall behind no problem, just pick up where you left off.\n\nHaving a problem with motivation and distractions? No problem, just read the detailed goal setting guide to turbo boost your productivity and motivation.\n\n\nWHAT'S COVERED?\n---------------\n\nEvery subject Cisco want you to know for your exams is covered with labs, theory, exams, reviews and crams. From RIP to OSPF, from VLSM to CIDR, IPv4 to IPv6, STP to CDP. Every exam topic is covered in detail many times over.\n\nJust when you think you are ready you are hit with challenge labs and more exams to ensure you are more than ready for the tricky Cisco exams. There are over 60 labs in total. Some with careful explanations and some you have to work out for yourself","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0301cb533615b0570193c078e8e35119e60cb5e","amp;dn":"Cisco+CCNA+in+60+Days+-+Paul+William+Browning+-+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0301cb533615b0570193c078e8e35119e60cb5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,48,28,181,51,97,91,5,112,25,60,7,142,142,53,17,158,96,203,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
