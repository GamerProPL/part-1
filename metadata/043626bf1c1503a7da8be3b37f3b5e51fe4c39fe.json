Over time, the story grew to encompass the Iraq invasion. The rise of ISIS. The refugee crisis. A volatile political climate that had its roots in the 1970s. It became a &quot;giant jigsaw puzzle&quot; that required some serious editorial muscle.\r\n\r\nIt involved some index cards, laying out a bunch of pages on the floor and walking around them,&quot; Silverstein said. &quot;It involved a lot of pounding our heads on the tables trying to figure out the math of how this would lead to that.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe result, a tale that spans decades, 40,000 words and an entire issue of The New York Times Magazine, was published this morning. Titled &quot;Fractured Lands: How the Arab World Came Apart,&quot; the five-part saga is unusual in its scope, a sweeping chronicle told through the eyes of six characters spread across five different countries.\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/shtihl22\r\n\r\n=======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:043626bf1c1503a7da8be3b37f3b5e51fe4c39fe","amp;dn":"The+New+York+Times+Magazine+August+14+2016+True+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"043626bf1c1503a7da8be3b37f3b5e51fe4c39fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,54,38,191,28,21,3,167,218,139,227,179,127,59,94,81,254,76,57,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
