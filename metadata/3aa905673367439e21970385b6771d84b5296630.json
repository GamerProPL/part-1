Though barely out of high school, the four Oakland\n MCs bring an energy and consistency far beyond their years. \n They cast themselves as bemused observers, relating tales of\n urban violence, girls, and sucka MCs with cleverness and    \n exuberance. The production features sample piled upon       \n sample, creating a sun-soaked funk more lively and eclectic \n than the West Coast&amp;#039;s usual P-Funk-styled beats but without \n the gloom of East Coast hip-hop. In 1993, Souls of Mischief \n along with fellow Hieroglyphics Del the Funky Homosapien    \n and Casual gave notice that there was more out West than    \n languid G-funk. Indeed, the fluidity of Souls of Mischief&amp;#039;s \n rhymes and the freshness of their voice make 93 &amp;#039;Til        \n Infinity a startling debut and a hip-hop classic.           \n - Christopher Witt of All Music Guide                       \n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.hieroglyphics.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.hieroglyphics.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.....:.\n\n imagine. an off-shoot of one of the mp3 scene&amp;#039;s major\n releasing groups; developed with a different standard\n and set of ideals.  as a reaction to  the mp3 scene&amp;#039;s\n increasing  competition  and  hostility, imagine  was\n founded with a more focused intention; the music.\n\n each member&amp;#039;s devotion to music is not by unrewarding\n pride in the fastest sites, quickest advance release,\n or most releases, but by their own personal desire to\n promote the diffusion in music.\n\n thinking of joining? all we ask for is the sharing of\n your musical knowledge &amp; desire to contribute quality\n recordings and commentaries at your leisure--mutually\n benefiting yourself and other enthusiasts. if you too\n are fed up with competitive, time-consuming  nonsense\n that the mp3 scene can bring out, you may be ready to\n sit back, relax, and imagine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3aa905673367439e21970385b6771d84b5296630","amp;dn":"Souls_of_Mischief--93_til_Infinity-1993-i","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3aa905673367439e21970385b6771d84b5296630","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,169,5,103,51,103,67,158,33,151,3,133,182,119,29,132,181,41,102,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
