The series serves as a canonical continuation of the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and follows the events of that show's final televised season. It is produced by Joss Whedon, who wrote the first arc, &quot;The Long Way Home&quot;. The first issue was released on March 14, 2007.\n\nThe series was originally supposed to consist of about 25 issues, but series editor Scott Allie stated that they were already &quot;up to about 50, could go a little higher&quot;, before it was finally decided that the series would have a 40-issue run. On September 24, 2009, Joss Whedon announced the series would continue into Season Nine. While Allie and Whedon discussed the potential for a spin-off limited series to play out side-stories too far outside of Season Eight's narrative, only a Tales of the Vampires follow-up, a Willow one-shot and a Riley one-shot were released.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_season_eight&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_season_eight&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-season-eight/49-18201/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-season-eight/49-18201/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba7f15d92643d53bf03e1a158b03d5b523eac402","amp;dn":"Buffy+the+Vampire+Slayer+Season+8+%282007-2011+Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba7f15d92643d53bf03e1a158b03d5b523eac402","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,127,21,217,38,67,213,59,240,62,26,21,139,3,213,181,35,234,196,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
