Those who rebel against the coalition take on a purely militant view, coming to the opinion that the only way to bring peace is by ultimately crushing all who oppose them - especially xenos.\r\nFor the first time in their history, the war creates a schism in the Advent Unity. The loyalists seek to continue their policy of revenge against the Traders, and to assimilate all others to the Unityâ€™s influence. However, others amongst the Advent suspect that a corrupting influence from within has diverted the Unity from its proper destiny.\r\nThe divide created in the Vasari Empire is less pronounced, but just as severe to their people. With the Vasari now practically frantic to move on to new space, the loyalist faction abandons cooperation and decides to take the resources they need by any means necessary. Having accepted the need to work together, the rebel faction feels that their best chance for survival is to work with the other races and bring them along to flee the approaching enemy.\r\nTake the battle for galactic supremacy to its ultimate level in Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion â€“ a standalone RT4X game that combines the tactics of real-time strategy with the depth of the 4X genre (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate).\r\nNew Factions Decide whether to play as a Loyalist or Rebel â€“ each unlocks new technologies, ships and play styles for each race.\r\nNew Titan Class Warships: Mighty titans enter the fray of the war to tip the scales of power. Each faction may field their own unique titan, drawing upon unique strengths and abilities on the battlefield.\r\nNew and Updated Capital Ships: A new capital ship joins the fleet for each race to offer even more tactical options. Additionally, all existing capital ships have been upgraded to four levels for their abilities, allowing players to focus their ships along specific strengths.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Vista SP2 / 7 SP1 / 8 / 10 \r\nProcessor: 3 GHz Intel Pentium 4 Processor or Equivalent\r\nMemory: 2 GB Available System Memory\r\nGraphics: 256 MB Video Card w/Pixel Shader 3.0 Support (Radeon X1650 / GeForce 6800* or Better)\r\nDirectX 9.0c\r\n5 GB Hard Disk Space\r\nDirectX 9.0c Compatible Sound Card\r\nMouse, Keyboard\r\n\r\nRecommended system requirements - Windows: Vista SP2 / 7 SP1 / 8 / 10 \r\nProcessor: Intel Core i5/i7 Processor or Equivalent \r\nMemory: 4 GB Available System Memory\r\nGraphics: 1 GB Video Card w/Pixel Shader 3.0 Support (Radeon X3000 / GeForce 8000 Series or Better)\r\nDirectX 9.0c\r\n5 GB Hard Disk Space\r\nDirectX 9.0c Compatible Sound Card\r\nMouse, Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac78829cbb86552fff66f5f45eba2d59d2c582e9","amp;dn":"Sins+of+a+Solar+Empire%3A+Rebellion+-+Ultimate+Edition+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac78829cbb86552fff66f5f45eba2d59d2c582e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,120,130,156,187,134,85,47,255,102,245,244,94,186,45,89,210,197,130,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
