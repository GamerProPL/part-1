It is to help you win games of Magic: the Gathering. The book, if taken to heart, helps you achieve this by teaching you mental &quot;tricks&quot; or mental &quot;habits&quot;, for lack of a better term.  Good readings, and I hope this &quot;top deck&quot; was what you were hoping for. -- IvoryMask","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caeab2a137f022918b4ee169397bdb3f01bb34f5","amp;dn":"Next+Level+Magic+by+Patrick+Chapin+Magic+the+Gathering%2C+MtG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caeab2a137f022918b4ee169397bdb3f01bb34f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,234,178,161,55,240,34,145,139,78,225,105,57,123,219,63,1,187,52,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
