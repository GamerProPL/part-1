It's jazz mixed with Hip Hop, and in much the same way Us3 would do it at about the same time. So what we have is producer/rapper Easy Mo Bee mixing hip hop drums and samples while Miles Davis played the horn, and yes, three tracks contain lyrics too. The problem with the lyrics I have is that they are pretty lame and mostly praise Miles, but I guess it's his album anyway.\r\nThere was 6 tracks recorded with Miles before he died and 2 done post-humous. \r\nThe production is so well done that one can't tell which is which and I'll live it to the listener to find out. \r\nI like this kind of jazz and although critics hated this album I think, for the time, it was something new and fresh and even fans of St Germain may get a kick out of the instrumental ones","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d4f1e4663789fd2c2ee5cc7d667abcd1e2ad8ac","amp;dn":"Miles+Davis+-+Doo-Bop+%5BFlac%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d4f1e4663789fd2c2ee5cc7d667abcd1e2ad8ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,79,30,70,99,120,159,210,194,238,92,199,214,103,171,205,30,42,216,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
