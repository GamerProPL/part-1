The man does a phenomenal job, giving each character a different voice and singing  ::SINGING:: every song. Definitely the best reading of The Hobbit I&amp;#039;ve heard, and I think the only one on TPB right now. Nothing beats an old British guy reading literature.\n\nThe 219 .mp3 tracks are split up between ten folders (for the ten cds they&amp;#039;re ripped from), and each track is labeled according to its chapter.\n\nTotal listening time is just over eleven hours. Hope you enjoy as much as I do.\n\nxoxo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e61f717788f4134c172a97b26627e7e095d3fd6","amp;dn":"JRR+Tolkien%5C%27s+The+Hobbit+Audiobook+with+Rob+Inglis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e61f717788f4134c172a97b26627e7e095d3fd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,97,247,23,120,143,65,52,193,114,169,123,38,98,126,126,9,93,63,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
