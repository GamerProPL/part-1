While she continued to sell records in healthy numbers into the 21st century, she expanded her activities as an actress in film and on the legitimate stage, and particularly on television, where she starred in a long-running situation comedy. Such diversification made her the greatest crossover star to emerge from country music since Dolly Parton. \n\n\nGenre................: Country\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Nash Icon\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Lossless Audiochecker, ACCURIP Log\n\n01.Going Out Like That\n02.Enough (Featuring Jennifer Nettles)\n03.She Got Drunk Last Night\n04.Livin' Ain't Killed Me Yet\n05.That's When I Knew\n06.I'll Go On\n07.Until They Don't Love\n08.Promise Me Love\n09.Just Like Them Horses\n10.Love Somebody\n11.Love Land\n12.Pray For Peace\n13.Whatever Way It Hurts The Least (Bonus Track)\n14.More Than Just Her Last Name (Bonus Track)\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:587423c9dde060e86ba4aa9564713d41c6289c4e","amp;dn":"Reba+McEntire+-+Love+Somebody+%28Deluxe%29+%282015%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"587423c9dde060e86ba4aa9564713d41c6289c4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,116,35,201,221,224,96,232,107,164,170,149,100,113,61,65,198,40,156,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
