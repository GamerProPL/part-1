The normally quiet South coast suddenly witnessed a huge crowd. People gathered to watch a dead sperm whale, washed up onto the shore. The whale had no visible wounds on its body, nor was it old enough to die. As people speculated about the whale's abnormal death, an autopsy revealed the shocking truth. The whale had ingested almost 17 kg of plastic into its stomach, and severe indigestion had killed it. This tragic incident is an indication of how Man harms his own environment, and fellow creatures. It's time for mankind to take remedial measures to protect our environment, and green technology is probably the most effective one. It strives to meet human needs without hurting nature.\nThis issue of 'Tell Me Why,' will give you an insight into green technology - the key to a better future.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s7.postimg.org/pb9p8rs7f/Green_Technology_Tell_Me_Why_106.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s7.postimg.org/pb9p8rs7f/Green_Technology_Tell_Me_Why_106.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee429d449ffd8a6c3582c45f65103dcedb19fbcf","amp;dn":"Green+Technology+%28Tell+Me+Why+%23106%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee429d449ffd8a6c3582c45f65103dcedb19fbcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,66,157,68,159,253,138,108,53,130,196,95,101,16,61,206,219,25,251,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
