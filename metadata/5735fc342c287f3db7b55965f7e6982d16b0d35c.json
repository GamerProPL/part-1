Walas (Gordon and Breach, 1995).pdf\r\n\r\nReactors are the basic equipment in any chemical plant. This collection of solved problems in elementary chemical reaction kinetics describes their process design from an engineer's point of view. Each chapter begins with a brief statement of definition and theory accompanied by original problems and others modified from existing literature. The book covers numerical techniques, analysis of rate data, sizes and performances of ideal reactors, residence time distributions and performance of non-ideal models, solid catalyzed reactions, behavior of porous catalysts, and reactions between multiple phases including biochemical processes. The problems, numbering over 1000, are classified into 54 categories. Solutions are mostly presented as graphs or tables with some key theoretical developments given in problem form","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5735fc342c287f3db7b55965f7e6982d16b0d35c","amp;dn":"Chemical+Reaction+Engineering+Handbook+of+Solved+Problems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5735fc342c287f3db7b55965f7e6982d16b0d35c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,53,252,52,44,40,127,61,183,181,89,101,247,230,152,45,22,176,211,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
