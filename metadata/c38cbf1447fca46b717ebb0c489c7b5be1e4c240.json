Fox [epub]\r\n\r\nOn 1 June 1666 a large but outnumbered English fleet engaged the Dutch off the mouth of the Thames in a colossal battle that was to involve nearly 200 ships and last four days. False intelligence had led the English to divide their fleet to meet a phantom threat from France and although the errant squadron rejoined on the final day of the battle, it was not enough to redress the balance.
