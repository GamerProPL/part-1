As the era of the nation-state draws quickly to a close, the rules of warfare evolve even more rapidly. More and more nations become increasingly dependent on Private Military Companies (PMCs) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ elite mercenaries with a lax view of the law. The Reykjavik Accords further legitimize their existence by authorizing their right to serve in every aspect of military operations. There goes the neighborhood...\n\nTom Clancy's H.A.W.X. is primed to revolutionize the way we think about combat in the sky. Cutting-edge technology, devastating firepower, and intense dogfights award this new title a deserving place in the prestigious Tom Clancy Franchise. Soon, flying at Mach 3 becomes a right, not a privilege.\n\n*ENHANCED REALITY SYSTEM (E.R.S.) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ E.R.S. is in-game technology that helps turn novice aviators into elite pilots of the future. The Enhanced Reality System is the core of the H.A.W.X. flight experience: aircraft interception trajectories, incoming missile detection, anti-crash system, damage assessment, tactical map, and weapons trajectory control. E.R.S. also allows players to issue orders to their squadron and other units, making this system as iconic to HAWX as the Cross-Com system is to Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced WarfighterÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®! \n*ASSISTANCE MODE ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Players can ease into their flight missions and gain a level of comfort with the use of the assistance mode. Once employed, players can take full advantage of their technological support through the E.R.S and gain maximum piloting security. If the situation calls for the player to unleash the full potential of the aircraft, the assistance mode can be switched off and all safety features will be deactivated. This comes with increased risks, but allows the player advanced dogfighting maneuvers and stunning third-person views. \n*REVOLUTIONARY MULTIPLAYER ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ For the first time ever in the air-combat genre, players will be able to experience the entire solo campaign in four-player co-op with seamless JUMP IN/JUMP OUT functionality. In PVP mode, players can challenge each other in intense dog-fighting sessions and find out who's the top gun. Winning players are rewarded with experience points and money to unlock more weapons. \n*REALISM AND TECHNOLOGY ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Players have the opportunity to take the throttle of over 50 famous aircrafts, and take them over real world locations &amp; cities in photo-realistic environments created with the best commercial satellite data on the civilian market.\n\n==============================================================================\nGAMEPLAY TYPE: Combat Flight Action\n\n==============================================================================\nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:\n\n*Processor: IntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® PentiumÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 4 2.0 GHz, or AMD Athlon XP 2000+ or higher (Intel Core 2 Duo 6320 / AMD Athlon X2 4000+ or higher recommended)\n*Memory: 1 GB (Windows XP) (2 GB recommended), 2 GB Windows Vista\n*Graphics: 128 MB DirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“compliant, Shader 2.0ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“enabled video card (256 MB DirectX 10.0ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“compliant video card or DirectX 9.0ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“compliant card with Shader Model 3.0 or higher recommended) (see supported list*)\n*DirectX Version: DirectX 9.0 or 10.0 libraries (included)\n*Sound: DirectX 9.0ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“compliant sound card\n*Peripherals Supported: Windows-compliant keyboard, mouse, optional controller (Xbox 360Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Controller for Windows recommended)\n*Multiplayer: Broadband connection with 128 kbps upstream or faster / LAN connection\n*Supported Video Cards at Time of Release:\nShader Model 2.0: NVIDIAÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® GeForceÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 59xx, ATIÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® RADEONÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® X8xx / 9800\nShader Model 3.0 / 4.0: NVIDIAÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® GeForceÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 6/7/8/9 series, ATIÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® RADEONÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® X1300XT / X1650-1950/HD 2000/3000/4000 series, ATIÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Crossfire, NVIDIA SLI\n*Joysticks supported: Gembird Dual Force GamePad, Logitech Dual Action, Logitech Extreme 3D, LOGITECH EXTREME 3D PRO, LOGITECH FREEDOM 2.4 CORDLESS JOYSTICK, Logitech Rumblepad 2, Mad Catz, SAITEK AVIATOR, SAITEK CYBORG EVO, SAITEK CYBORG EVO FORCE, SAITEK CYBORG ST 90 JOYSTICK, Saitek FPS, Saitek P2600 Rumble, Saitek P880, Saitek X52 Flight Control System, Sony Analog Controller (with Dual PSX-USB Adaptor), THRUSTMASTER AFTERBURNER II, Thrustmaster Dual Trigger, Thrustmaster Dual Trigger Force, Thrustmaster FireStorm Dual Analog 3, Thrustmaster FireStorm Dual Power 3 Gamepad, Thrustmaster HOTAS Cougar Joystick, Thrustmaster RunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢NÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Drive, Thrustmaster RunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢NÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Drive 3-in-1 Rumble Force, Thrustmaster T.Flight Stick X, Thrustmaster T-Mini, THRUSTMASTER TOP GUN FOX 2 PRO, TRUST PREDATOR, TRUST QZ 501 PREDATOR, Xbox360 Controller.\nOther controllers may work but functionality may vary.\n\n==============================================================================\nGAMESPOT RATING: 7.6\n\n==============================================================================\nINSTRUCTIONS\n==============================================================================\n(1) Run Setup.bat\n(2) Run desktop shortcut when installation is completed\n(3) Have phun :)\n\n==============================================================================\nRIP NOTES\n\n* If you find any issues with running the game, download DirectX at:\n   &lt;a href=&quot;
