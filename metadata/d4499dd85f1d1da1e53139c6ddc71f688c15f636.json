She is currently in the midst of divorce proceedings and the apartment, though near an excellent school for her daughter, is all she can afford. From the time she arrives, there are mysterious occurrences and there is a constant drip from the ceiling in the only bedroom. There are also noises coming from the apartment directly above hers, though it would appear to be vacant. Is the apartment haunted or is there a simpler explanation?\n\nInfo: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382628/\nRelease Date: 8 July 2005 (USA)\nGenre: Drama | Horror | Thriller\nStars: Jennifer Connelly, Ariel Gade, John C.
