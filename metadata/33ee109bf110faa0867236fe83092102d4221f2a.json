Will Rick take the book to his grave or will the negotiation have a bitter end? Next, things get whimsical when two sculptures from Dr. Seuss' unorthodox taxidermy collection are brought in. Will Rick's heart grow two sizes or will he say, &quot;Green eggs and scram&quot;? And later, a tear-gas baton forces its way into the shop. Will Corey think it's a riot or will he be blinded by the price?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33ee109bf110faa0867236fe83092102d4221f2a","amp;dn":"Pawn+Stars+S13E07+Death+and+Taxidermy+WEB-DL+x264-JIVE%5Bstate%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33ee109bf110faa0867236fe83092102d4221f2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,238,16,155,241,16,250,160,134,114,54,254,131,9,33,2,212,34,31,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
