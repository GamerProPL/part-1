Then came SuperFreakonomics, a documentary film, an award-winning podcast, and more.\n\nNow, with Think Like a Freak, Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner have written their most revolutionary book yet. With their trademark blend of captivating storytelling and unconventional analysis, they take us inside their thought process and teach us all to think a bit more productively, more creatively, more rationallyÃ¢â‚¬â€to think, that is, like a Freak.\n\nLevitt and Dubner offer a blueprint for an entirely new way to solve problems, whether your interest lies in minor lifehacks or major global reforms. As always, no topic is off-limits. They range from business to philanthropy to sports to politics, all with the goal of retraining your brain. Along the way, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn the secrets of a Japanese hot-dog-eating champion, the reason an Australian doctor swallowed a batch of dangerous bacteria, and why Nigerian e-mail scammers make a point of saying theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re from Nigeria.\n\nSome of the steps toward thinking like a Freak:\n\nFirst, put away your moral compassÃ¢â‚¬â€because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to see a problem clearly if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve already decided what to do about it.\nLearn to say Ã¢â‚¬Å“I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t knowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€for until you can admit what you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t yet know, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s virtually impossible to learn what you need to.\nThink like a childÃ¢â‚¬â€because youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll come up with better ideas and ask better questions.\nTake a master class in incentivesÃ¢â‚¬â€because for better or worse, incentives rule our world.\nLearn to persuade people who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to be persuadedÃ¢â‚¬â€because being right is rarely enough to carry the day.\nLearn to appreciate the upside of quittingÃ¢â‚¬â€because you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t solve tomorrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s problem if you arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t willing to abandon todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dud.\nLevitt and Dubner plainly see the world like no one else. Now you can too. Never before have such iconoclastic thinkers been so revealingÃ¢â‚¬â€and so much fun to read.\n\nReview\n\nIn one of the many wonderful moments in Think Like a Freak, Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner ask the question: Who is easier to foolÃ¢â‚¬â€kids or adults? The obvious answer, of course, is kids. The clichÃƒÂ© is about taking candy from a baby, not a grown man. But instead of accepting conventional wisdom as fact, the two sit down with the magician Alex StoneÃ¢â‚¬â€someone in the business of fooling peopleÃ¢â‚¬â€and ask him what he thinks. And his answer? Adults.\n\nStone gave the example of the staple of magic tricks, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“double lift,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ where two cards are presented as one. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how a magician can seemingly bury a card that you have selected at random and then miraculously retrieve it. Stone has done the double lift countless times in his career, and he says it is kidsÃ¢â‚¬â€overwhelminglyÃ¢â‚¬â€who see through it. Why? The magicianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s job is to present a series of cuesÃ¢â‚¬â€to guide the attention of his audienceÃ¢â‚¬â€and adults are really good at following cues and paying attention. Kids arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. Their gaze wanders. Adults have a set of expectations and assumptions about the way the world works, which makes them vulnerable to a profession that tries to exploit those expectations and assumptions. Kids donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know enough to be exploited. Kids are more curious. They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t overthink problems; theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re more likely to understand that the basis of the trick is something really, really simple. And most of allÃ¢â‚¬â€and this is my favoriteÃ¢â‚¬â€kids are shorter than adults, so they quite literally see the trick from a different and more revealing angle.\n\nThink Like a Freak is not a book about how to understand magic tricks. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what Dubner and LevittÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first two booksÃ¢â‚¬â€Freakonomics and SuperFreakonomicsÃ¢â‚¬â€were about. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about the attitude we need to take towards the tricks and the problems that the world throws at us. Dubner and Levitt have a set of prescriptions about what that attitude comes down to, but at its root it comes down to putting yourself in the mind of the child, gazing upwards at the double lift: free yourself from expectations, be prepared for a really really simple explanation, and let your attention wander from time to time.\n\nThe two briefly revisit their famous argument from their first book about the link between the surge in abortions in the 1970s and the fall in violent crime twenty years later. Their point is not to reargue that particular claim. It is to point out that we shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t avoid arguments like that just because they leave us a bit squeamish. They also tell the story of the Australian doctor Barry Marshall, who overturned years of received wisdom when he proved that ulcers are caused by gastric bacteria, not spicy food and stress. That idea was more than heretical at first. It was absurd. It was the kind of random idea that only a child would have. But Dubner and LevittÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s point, in their utterly captivating new book, is that following your curiosityÃ¢â‚¬â€even to the most heretical and absurd endÃ¢â‚¬â€makes the world a better place. It is also a lot of fun.\n\nReviews\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Utterly captivating.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Malcolm Gladwell, New York Times bestselling author of Blink, The Tipping Point, and David and Goliath)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Over nine entertaining chapters [Levitt and Dubner] demonstrate how not to fall into hackneyed approaches to solving problems and concretely illustrate how to reframe questions.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (New York Daily News)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Compelling and fun.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (New York Post)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This book will change your life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Daily Express (London))\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Good ideas... expressed with panache.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Financial Times)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“An interesting and thought-provoking read.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (The Horn)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Their most revolutionary book yet.
