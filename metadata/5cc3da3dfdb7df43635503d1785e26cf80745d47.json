Together, these are the tools that will reshape the way we think about fitness and this book will stand as the definitive guide to targeting the key muscles that men and women want to develop and tone.\n\nThe beauty of these tools is that they are simple, inexpensive, and can be used in a small space so readers can exercise in the convenience of their homes. Most important is that they allow the freedom to use a full range of motion, unlike the rigid, limiting structure of weight machines. No longer restrained by the typical up/down motion of barbells and machines, readers can become strong in any direction. And sanctioned by MenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Health, this book demonstrates with large color photos more than 150 strength exercises that incorporate the three key movementsÃ¢â‚¬â€pushing, pulling, and swingingÃ¢â‚¬â€that make up the perfect full-range-of-motion workout. Because it emphasizes building functional strength for real-world application and total-body fitness Men's Health Push, Pull, Swing by Myatt Murphy, CSCS will appeal to beginners as well as fitness buffs, especially those who enjoy CrossFit style workouts.\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/03d1/a2cb280.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cc3da3dfdb7df43635503d1785e26cf80745d47","amp;dn":"Men%27s+Health+Push%2C+Pull%2C+Swing%3A+The+Fat-Torching-+Myatt+Murphy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cc3da3dfdb7df43635503d1785e26cf80745d47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,195,218,61,253,183,223,67,99,85,3,209,120,94,38,207,128,116,93,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
