Simple to use and program, it can be embedded in innovative projects and has been used to build Internet-connected dog treat dispensers, low-res plotters, cell phoneÃ¢â‚¬â€œoperated coffeemakers, and a solar-powered computer.\n\nThis course shows how to obtain, configure, and do simple tasks with a Raspberry Pi. Mark Niemann-Ross shows you how to play sounds, boot up a GUI, program simple tasks, install software, and begin to explore hardware control with GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output).\nTopics include:\n\n    Buying a Raspberry Pi\n    Connecting hardware\n    Installing the Raspbian OS\n    Working with frequently used Linux commands\n    Setting up VNC to control the Raspberry Pi remotely\n    Playing a sound\n    Building a simple webcam website\n    Controlling a device with GPIO in Python\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:630798fb0c5fb4c25ad720c1c7bbce15449fd1cc","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Up+and+Running+with+Raspberry+Pi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"630798fb0c5fb4c25ad720c1c7bbce15449fd1cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,7,152,251,12,95,180,194,90,215,32,193,199,187,206,21,68,159,209,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
