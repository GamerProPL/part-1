Its innovative pedagogical features, which encourage students to understand, apply, and synthesize content, reinforce the principles of general chemistry and provide the ideal platform for later studies.\nThe new tenth addition boasts a number of improvements, including expanded coverage of organic chemistry, as well as a consistent 3-part structure (Analyze Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Solve Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Assess) for every worked example. All of the student-favourite, pedagogically rich elements of this textbook have returned in the tenth edition with renewed focus, including 10 to 25 new questions per chapter and updated integrative examples that all follow the Practice Example A and Practice Example B format.\n\nAbout the Authors\nRalph H. Petrucci\nRalph Petrucci received his B.S. in Chemistry from Union College, Schenectady, NY, and his Ph.D. from the University of WisconsinÃ¢â‚¬â€Madison. Dr. Petrucci joined the planning staff of the new California State University campus at San Bernardino in 1964. There, in addition to his faculty appointment, he served as Chairman of the Natural Sciences Division and Dean of Academic Planning before retiring from teaching.\nF. Geoffrey Herring\nGeoff Herring received his B.Sc. and his Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry, both from the University of London. He is currently a Professor in the Department of Chemistry of the University of British Columbia, Vancouver.\nJeffry D. Madura\nJeffry D. Madura received his B.A. from Thiel College and his Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry from Purdue University. He is currently Professor and Chair in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry of Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, PA.\nCarey Bissonnette\nCarey Bissonnette received his B.Sc. in Chemistry from the University of Waterloo, Ontario and his Ph.D. in Theoretical Chemistry from the University of Camridge.
