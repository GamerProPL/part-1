Tolkien, and high-resolution colour images of all of TolkienÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illustrations for the book, many of which are also included in their earlier black-and-white versions and can be revealed by a simple swipe of the screen.\n \nA Foreword by Christopher Tolkien, complete with illustrations including manuscript pages and unused drawings, examines the writing of the book. This Enhanced eBook also includes recently discovered audio recordings of J.R.R. Tolkien reading excerpts from The Hobbit, including the dwarvesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ party song, the account of their capture by the three trolls, and Bilbo BagginsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s creepy encounter with the hideous Gollum.\n \nBilbo Baggins enjoys a quiet and contented life, with no desire to travel far from the comforts of home. Then one day the wizard Gandalf and a band of dwarves arrive unexpectedly and enlist his servicesÃ¢â‚¬â€as a burglarÃ¢â‚¬â€on a dangerous expedition to raid the treasure-hoard of Smaug the dragon. Bilbo's life is never to be the same again.\n \nThe Hobbit was an instant success when it was first published in 1937, and 75 years later Tolkien's epic tale of hobbits, elves, dwarves, goblins, magic and adventure has lost none of its appeal.\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61864c6ec9ad2cce674b0ad16ea97e60c183b43d","amp;dn":"The+Hobbit+-+Enhanced+Edition+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61864c6ec9ad2cce674b0ad16ea97e60c183b43d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,134,76,110,201,173,44,206,103,75,10,209,110,169,126,96,193,131,180,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
