It was founded in 1923 and for decades dominated by Henry Luce, who built a highly profitable stable of magazines. A European edition (Time Europe, formerly known as Time Atlantic) is published in London and also covers the Middle East, Africa and, since 2003, Latin America. An Asian edition (Time Asia) is based in Hong Kong. The South Pacific edition, which covers Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands, is based in Sydney, Australia. In December 2008, Time discontinued publishing a Canadian advertiser edition.\r\n\r\nTheyÃ¢Â€â„¢re turning the web into a cesspool of aggression and violence. What watching them is doing to the rest of us may be even worse\r\n\r\nUpdated, August 18\r\n\r\nThis story is not a good idea. Not for society and certainly not for me. Because what trolls feed on is attention. And this little bitâ€“these several thousand wordsâ€“is like leaving bears a pan of baklava.\r\n\r\nIt would be smarter to be cautious, because the InternetÃ¢Â€â„¢s personality has changed. Once it was a geek with lofty ideals about the free flow of information. Now, if you need help improving your upload speeds the web is eager to help with technical details, but if you tell it youÃ¢Â€â„¢re struggling with depression it will try to goad you into killing yourself. Psychologists call this the online disinhibition effect, in which factors like anonymity, invisibility, a lack of authority and not communicating in real time strip away the mores society spent millennia building. And itÃ¢Â€â„¢s seeping from our smartphones into every aspect of our lives.\r\n\r\nThe people who relish this online freedom are called trolls, a term that originally came from a fishing method online thieves use to find victims. It quickly morphed to refer to the monsters who hide in darkness and threaten people. Internet trolls have a manifesto of sorts, which states they are doing it for the â€œlulz,â€ or laughs. What trolls do for the lulz ranges from clever pranks to harassment to violent threats. ThereÃ¢Â€â„¢s also doxxingâ€“publishing personal data, such as Social Security numbers and bank accountsâ€“and swatting, calling in an emergency to a victimÃ¢Â€â„¢s house so the SWAT team busts in. When victims do not experience lulz, trolls tell them they have no sense of humor. Trolls are turning social media and comment boards into a giant locker room in a teen movie, with towel-snapping racial epithets and misogyny.\r\n\r\nTheyÃ¢Â€â„¢ve been steadily upping their game. In 2011, trolls descended onmemorial pages of recently deceased users to mock their deaths. In 2012, after feminist Anita Sarkeesian started a Kickstarter campaign to fund a series of YouTube videos chronicling misogyny in video games, she received bomb threats at speaking engagements, doxxing threats, rape threats and an unwanted starring role in a video game called Beat Up Anita Sarkeesian. In June of this year, Jonathan Weisman, the deputy Washington editor of the New York Times, quit Twitter, on which he had nearly 35,000 followers, after a barrage of anti-Semitic messages. At the end of July, feminist writer Jessica Valenti said she was leaving social media after receiving a rape threat against her daughter, who is 5 years old.\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/shtihl22\r\n\r\n=======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8a2c074f69a3611de3ea0319301be2d57b8d656","amp;dn":"Time+Magazine+USA+-+August+29+2016+True+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8a2c074f69a3611de3ea0319301be2d57b8d656","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,162,192,116,246,154,54,17,222,62,160,49,147,1,190,45,87,184,214,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
