The integration of Natural, Eastern, and Western medicines offers a clearer insight into many crucial factors that affect health and healing rather than just one particular system. Dr. Haasâ€™s approach is to move people into the positive aspects of the â€˜Disease-Health Continuumâ€™ with better energy, vitality and creativity, helping to create positive actions for our planet and for human beings in general. Many years in the making, this book completes the Staying Healthy trilogy that began with Staying Healthy with the Seasons (1981, 2003) and continued with Staying Healthy with Nutrition (1992, 2006)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9af3255e3adbb6371c6df975714e6a4536f6d726","amp;dn":"Staying+Healthy+with+NEW+Medicine+%282016%29+%28Epub%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9af3255e3adbb6371c6df975714e6a4536f6d726","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,243,37,94,58,219,182,55,28,109,249,117,113,78,106,69,54,246,215,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
