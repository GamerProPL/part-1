The album was produced Audiohammer Studios by Mark Lewis.\n\nBassist Alex Webster said &quot;I think it's turning out to be kind of a dark-sounding album. Which, you know, it's a death metal album, so, of course, it should be kind of dark and eerie sounding anyway, but I think this one a little more than normal. That was kind of the direction the songwriting went in.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sadistic Embodiment&quot; was officially released on the YouTube channel of Metal Blade Records on July 1 2014. &quot;The Murderer's Pact&quot; was streamed via Loudwire.com on September 8 2014.\n\nContentsTrack listing\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;High Velocity Impact Spatter&quot;   \t4:06\n2. \t&quot;Sadistic Embodiment&quot;   \t3:17\n3. \t&quot;Kill or Become&quot;   \t3:50\n4. \t&quot;A Skeletal Domain&quot;   \t3:38\n5. \t&quot;Headlong into Carnage&quot;   \t3:01\n6. \t&quot;The Murderer's Pact&quot;   \t5:05\n7. \t&quot;Funeral Cremation&quot;   \t3:41\n8. \t&quot;Icepick Lobotomy&quot;   \t3:16\n9. \t&quot;Vector of Cruelty&quot;   \t3:25\n10. \t&quot;Bloodstained Cement&quot;   \t3:41\n11. \t&quot;Asphyxiate to Resuscitate&quot;   \t3:47\n12. \t&quot;Hollowed Bodies&quot;   \t3:05\nReception\nProfessional ratings\nReview scores\nSource \tRating\nAll About The Rock \t8.5/10 stars\nMetalSucks \t3/5 stars\nSputnik Music \t4/5 stars\n\nWriting for All About The Rock, former Internal Bleeding frontman Frank Rini said about A Skeletal Domain: &quot;This new release sees Cannibal Corpse bringing forth more blast beats, but also incorporating some truly dark guitar melodies, making this a sinister sounding and evil album in parts&quot;.\nPersonnel\n\n    George &quot;Corpsegrinder&quot; Fisher (Vocals)\n    Alex Webster (Bass)\n    Pat O'Brien (Guitar)\n    Rob Barrett (Guitar)\n    Paul Mazurkiewicz (Drums)\n\nNew from Cannibal Corpse 320k mp3  Seed so others can enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:148cbb0d7d75d18ba5566a69513fb02c021ae100","amp;dn":"Cannibal+Corpse+-+A+Skeletal+Domain++mp3++320k+++2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"148cbb0d7d75d18ba5566a69513fb02c021ae100","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,140,187,13,125,117,209,139,165,86,106,105,81,63,176,44,2,26,225,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
