Scranton also pointed to the close resemblance between the keywords and component elements of Dogon cosmology and those of ancient Egypt, and the implication that ancient cosmology may also be about actual science.\r\n\r\nSacred Symbols of the Dogon uses these parallels as the starting point for a new interpretation of the Egyptian hieroglyphic language. By substituting Dogon cosmological drawings for equivalent glyph-shapes in Egyptian words, a new way of reading and interpreting the Egyptian hieroglyphs emerges. Scranton shows how each hieroglyph constitutes an entire concept, and that their meanings are scientific in nature. Using the Dogon symbols as a â€œRosetta stone,â€ he reveals references within the ancient Egyptian language that define the full range of scientific components of matter: from massless waves to the completed atom, even suggesting direct correlations to a fully realized unified field theory","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53fe9f97fcd71e6fdb69020a9215c35fe017d673","amp;dn":"Sacred+Symbols+of+the+Dogon%3A+Advanced+Science+in+Hieroglyphs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53fe9f97fcd71e6fdb69020a9215c35fe017d673","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,254,159,151,252,215,30,111,219,105,2,10,146,21,195,95,224,23,214,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
