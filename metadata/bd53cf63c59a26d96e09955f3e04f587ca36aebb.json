In most cases, their achievements can be attributed to hard work and natural talent. But some will take drugs to enhance their performance. Written by top biochemist Chris Cooper, Run, Swim, Throw, CHEAT explains how people have cheated in the past, how they cheat now, and how they will cheat in the future. \r\n\r\nFrom anabolic steroids to human growth hormone and the blood booster EPO, Cooper separates the truth from the hype, revealing what works and what doesn't work. More disturbing, the book argues that science has barely touched the surface of performance enhancement; there are many, many drugs yet to be discovered. Future developments are limited only by our imagination, research funding, and, of course, ethics.\r\n\r\nMoreover, recent findings of genetic enhancements on animals show it is possible to create super animals that far outperform their peers, suggesting that the top human athletes of the future may get there via gene manipulation. Cooper also argues that drug testing is of necessity imperfect and the rules arbitrary. And it cannot succeed, as it will always fight a losing battle between doper and tester. But the alternative - free access to all chemical tools - is not necessarily desirable. Just because a war cannot be won, does not mean that surrendering will lead to better sport","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd53cf63c59a26d96e09955f3e04f587ca36aebb","amp;dn":"Run%2C+Swim%2C+Throw%2C+Cheat%3A+The+Science+Behind+Drugs+in+Sport","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd53cf63c59a26d96e09955f3e04f587ca36aebb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,83,207,99,197,154,38,217,110,9,149,95,62,4,245,135,202,54,174,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
