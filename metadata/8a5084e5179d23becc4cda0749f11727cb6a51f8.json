Picking up the pseudo-mysticism and Native American obsessions of the Doors, the guitar-orchestrations of Led Zeppelin, and the three-chord crunch of AC/DC, while adding touches of post-punk goth rock, the Cult gained a dedicated following in their native Britain with mid-'80s singles like &quot;She Sells Sanctuary&quot; before breaking into the American metal market in the late '80s with &quot;Love Removal Machine.&quot; Though the group managed one Top Ten in America with 1989's Sonic Temple, the band was plagued with off-stage tensions and problems that prevented them from retaining their popularity. The Cult split in 1995 following a pair of unsuccessful records, but returned on an occasional basis for new records - always anchored by vocalist Ian Astbury and guitarist Billy Duffy.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.She Sells Sanctuary\n02.Fire Woman\n03.Lil' Devil\n04.Spiritwalker\n05.The Witch\n06.Revolution\n07.Wild Hearted Son\n08.Love Removal Machine\n09.Rain\n10.Edie (Ciao Baby)\n11.Heart Of Soul\n12.Love\n13.Wild Flower\n14.Go West\n15.Ressurection Joe\n16.Sun King\n17.Sweet Soul Sister\n18.Earth Mofo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****                 \n\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a5084e5179d23becc4cda0749f11727cb6a51f8","amp;dn":"The+Cult+-+Pure+Cult+%5BBest+Of+%5D+%281993%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a5084e5179d23becc4cda0749f11727cb6a51f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,80,132,229,23,157,35,190,204,76,218,7,73,241,23,39,203,106,81,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
