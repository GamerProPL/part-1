VMware vSphere 5.1 is based on the ESXi hypervisor architecture, a thin purpose-built hypervisor that does not depend on a general purpose operating system, which does away with the requirement of persistent storage. So we can now store it on a dedicated compact storage device, drastically reducing the hypervisor install footprint to less than 150MB.\n\n&quot;VMware ESXi 5.1 Cookbook&quot; explores every aspect of VMware administration. We will learn to configure and to administer vSphere including high availability (HA), distributed resource scheduler (DRS), fault tolerance (FT), vMotion , svMotion, virtual machine provisioning, update manager, and distributed virtual switches. We will also explore advanced level operations with lots of tips and tricks to ease your job.\n\n&quot;VMware ESXi 5.1 Cookbook&quot; offers a comprehensive understanding of new features released with vSphere 5.1 and how it enhances your VMware virtual environment.
