Although his first nine novels were in Russian, he rose to international prominence as a writer of English prose.  He was a finalist for the National Book Award for Fiction seven times, but never won.\n\nLOLITA (1955) is his most famous novel and often considered his finest work in English.  It exhibits the love of intricate word play, classical allusion, and synesthetic detail characteristic of his work in general.  One of the best guides to the complexities of the novel is Alfred Appel's revised edition of THE ANNOTATED LOLITA, also included here.\n\nIn addition to a generous selection of Nabokov's novels and short fiction, this collection includes his famous autobiographical memoir (SPEAK, MEMORY); drama (the recently-published TRAGEDY OF MR. MORN); interviews and reviews (STRONG OPINIONS); and his SELECTED LETTERS.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format -- almost exclusively retail-quality -- unless otherwise indicated:\n\n* ADA, OR ADOR: A Family Chronicle (Vintage, 1990).\n\n* THE ANNOTATED LOLITA (Vintage, 2011).
