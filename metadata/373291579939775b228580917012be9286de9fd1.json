With a pop art collage of musical styles, oblique and ironic lyrics, and postmodern arrangements incorporating samples, drum machines, live instrumentation and sound effects, Beck has been hailed by critics and the public throughout his musical career as being amongst the most creative and idiosyncratic musicians of the 1990s and 2000s alternative rock.\n\nHe rose to underground popularity with his early works, which combined social criticism (as in &quot;MTV Makes Me Want to Smoke Crack&quot; and &quot;Deep Fried Love&quot;) with musical and lyrical experimentation. He first earned wider public attention for his breakthrough single &quot;Loser,&quot; a 1994 hit.\n\nBeck has cited The Cars, Bob Dylan, Mantronix, Gary Wilson, Pussy Galore, Willie Dixon, Bill Broonzy, and Sonic Youth among his influences. Two of Beck&amp;#039;s most popular and acclaimed recordings were Odelay (1996) and Sea Change (2002). Odelay was awarded Album of the Year by American magazine Rolling Stone and by UK publications NME and Mojo. Odelay also received a Grammy nomination for Best Album.\n\n\n\n=================================================================\nArtist    -  Beck        \nAlbum     -  various                                          \nGenre     -  alternative                                             \nLabel     -  various\nYear      -  1988 - present                                            \nTracks    -  n/a                                               \nPlaytime  -  n/a\nFile Type -  .mp3\nSize      -  1.11 GB\nkbps      -  VBR / 192 or higher / 256 AVG\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy.
