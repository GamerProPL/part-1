And yet they made it back home. This visceral new series for National Geographic fuses gripping personal testimony and high-octane dramatizations with haunting present day actuality filming of real life war heroes who walk among us. To be trapped behind enemy lines is every soldier's worst nightmare: a situation they all train for, few experience and even fewer survive. In each film, we witness how one person's contribution to the war effort becomes a pure battle for survival. This is modern warfare boiled down to the ground level fight for life. These are stories about overcoming incredible odds in some of the most hostile environments on earth.\r\nWith a focus on contemporary American stories there are pilots shot down in hostile territory, army units who strayed into the kill zone, and Special Forces on covert operations that spiral dramatically out of control. In all cases, our protagonists find themselves fighting for their lives - miles from safety. These aren't passive prisoners waiting to be saved. These are modern war heroes who take their survival into their own hands and go to extraordinary lengths to get out alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  The Real Black Hawk Down \r\nTwo Black Hawk helicopters are shot down during a deadly battle in Mogadishu between U.S. forces and Somali militia; the pilot of the downed helicopter and two soldiers involved reunite to recount the details.\r\n\r\n2)  Colombia Vice \r\nDEA agents McCullough and Martinez are kidnapped from their hotel in Colombia and driven into the jungle, where they are shot and separated while trying to escape; Martinez and McCullough recount the terrifying ordeal in heart-pounding detail.\r\n\r\n3)  To Hell and Back \r\nA group of U.S. Green Berets are pinned down by the Taliban in the Shok Valley, Afghanistan; two of the soldiers recount how they managed to survive for seven hours until they could be evacuated.\r\n\r\n4)  The One that Got Away \r\nEight British Special Air Services soldiers are dropped behind enemy lines during the Gulf War, but the mission goes terribly wrong and within days, three men are dead and four are captured; the sole survivor recounts his experience.\r\n\r\n5)  Stealth Fighter Down \r\nFor the first and only time, a U.S. stealth bomber is shot down; the pilot manages to eject and spends seven hours pinned behind enemy lines waiting for a daring helicopter rescue team to find him.\r\n\r\n6)  Memories of Hell \r\nThe first U.S. Navy pilot to be shot down and captured during the Vietnam War is also the first to escape; he opens up about the reconnaissance mission gone wrong and his near-death journey to freedom.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/33/No-Man-Left-Behind-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c8/No-Man-Left-Behind-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/dd/No-Man-Left-Behind-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/22/No-Man-Left-Behind-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7c/No-Man-Left-Behind-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/80/No-Man-Left-Behind-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2a/No-Man-Left-Behind-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/96/No-Man-Left-Behind-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/70/No-Man-Left-Behind-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b2/No-Man-Left-Behind-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9a/No-Man-Left-Behind-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2d/No-Man-Left-Behind-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/26/No-Man-Left-Behind-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1c/No-Man-Left-Behind-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d1/No-Man-Left-Behind-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/dc/No-Man-Left-Behind-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video: Bitrate: CRF-21 (~4026 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 44 mins,\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.28 GB average\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://channel.nationalgeographic.com/no-man-left-behind/video-gallery/?sort=recent&amp;filter=episodes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:952a6818ba22fd166d3fe015b32826ae4be4a937","amp;dn":"No+Man+Left+Behind+Series+1+1of6+The+Real+Black+Hawk+Down+720p+x","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"952a6818ba22fd166d3fe015b32826ae4be4a937","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,42,104,24,186,34,253,22,109,63,224,21,179,40,38,174,75,228,169,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
