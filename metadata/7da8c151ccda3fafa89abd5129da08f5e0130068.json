Tough all tag names are very organized, and all album covers are included.\n\n-*-\nSorry guys, but right now I can&amp;#039;t seed at high speeds. So I ask for your patience till we have nuff seeders.\n-*-\n\n\n\nAbout the band (text extracted from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seatbelts):\n\nThe Seatbelts (ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â·ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â¼ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‹â€ ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â«ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ ShÃƒâ€žÃ‚Â«toBerutsu?, also known as Seat Belts or SEATBELTS) were a Japanese blues/jazz band led by composer and instrumentalist Yoko Kanno. The name of the band, according to the fictional description given in the anime series Cowboy Bebop, derives from how the performers wear seatbelts to be safe while they play hardcore jam sessions.\nThe band performed the whole soundtrack of the anime series Cowboy Bebop and produced a total of seven albums and one live DVD. Their style is very diverse and ranges from straightforward big band jazz, blues, acoustic ballads, hard rock, country, funk to electronic, hip-hop and experimental compositions/elements.\nSince the band was focused mostly on instrumental work, The Seatbelts had no lead singer. However, Steve Conte (from The Contes and Crown Jewels) and Mai Yamane participated and sung on many of their songs. The lyrics of these songs were written mainly by Tim Jensen and Yoko Kanno herself. Singers Soichiro Otsuka and Gabriela Robin (rumored to be a pseudonym for Kanno) were responsible for the backing vocals on songs such as &quot;Blue&quot;.\nAfter a few years in hibernation, The Seatbelts regrouped in 2004 to perform the soundtrack for the second Cowboy Bebop video game, which is currently available in Japan. They all disbanded once they released the last album.\nMany of the members of The Seatbelts have also worked with Kanno and with each other on other projects as well, and some have even gone on to compose their own work. For example, guitarist Tsuneo Imahori also played guitar on the soundtracks for Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and Wolf&amp;#039;s Rain (both of which were composed by Kanno), as well as composing the soundtracks for Trigun and Gungrave.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7da8c151ccda3fafa89abd5129da08f5e0130068","amp;dn":"Cowboy+Bebop+OST%5C%27s+%28The+Seatbelts%29+-+All+CD%5C%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7da8c151ccda3fafa89abd5129da08f5e0130068","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,168,193,81,204,218,63,175,168,154,189,81,41,218,8,245,224,19,0,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
