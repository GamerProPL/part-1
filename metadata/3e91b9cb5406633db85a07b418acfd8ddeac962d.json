Different functions and protection components are available as part\nof Kaspersky Internet Security to deliver comprehensive protection.\n\nInstall notes: See included NFO file\n\nComputer Protection\n\nProtection components are designed to protect the computer against known and new threats, network attacks, fraud, and spam and other unsolicited information. Every type of threat is handled by an individual protection component (see the description of components in this section). Components can be enabled or disabled independently of one another, and their settings can be configured. In addition to the constant protection provided by the security components, we recommend that you regularly scan your computer for viruses. This is necessary in order to rule out the possibility of spreading malicious programs that have not been discovered by protection components, for example, because of a low security level set, or for other reasons. To keep Kaspersky Internet Security up to date, you need to update the databases and software modules used by the application. Some specific tasks that should be executed occasionally (such as removal of traces of a user's activities in the system) are executed using advanced tools and wizards. The following protection components stand guard over your computer in real time:\n\nFile Anti-Virus - File Anti-Virus prevents infection of the computer's file system. The component starts upon startup of the operating system, continuously remains in the computer's RAM, and scans all files bei ng opened, saved, or launched on your computer and all connected drives. Kaspersky Internet Security intercepts each attempt to access a file and scans the file for known viruses. The file can only be processed further if the file is not infected or is successfully treated by the application. If a file cannot be disinfected for any reason, it will be deleted. A copy of the file will be moved to Quarantine at that.\n\nMail Anti-Virus - Mail Anti-Virus scans incoming and outgoing email messages on your computer. The email is available to the addressee only if it does not contain dangerous objects.\n\nWeb Anti-Virus - Web Anti-Virus intercepts and blocks the execution of scripts on websites if they pose a threat. Web Anti-Virus also monitors all web traffic and blocks access to dangerous websites.\n\nIM Anti-Virus - IM Anti-Virus ensures the safe use of Internet pagers. The component protects information that comes to your computer via IM protocols. IM Anti-Virus ensures safe operation of various applications for instant messaging.\n\nApplication Control - Application Control logs actions performed by applications in the system, and manages applications' activities based on which group the component assigns them to. A set of rules is specified for each group of applications. These rules manage the applications' access to various operating system resources.\n\nFirewall - The Firewall ensures the security of your work in local networks and on the Internet. The component filters all network activities using rules of two types: rules for applications and packet rules.\n\nNetwork Monitor - Network Monitor is designed for monitoring network activity in real time.\n\nNetwork Attack Blocker - Network Attack Blocker loads at operating system startup and tracks incoming network traffic for activities characteristic of network attacks. Once an attempt to attack your computer is detected, Kaspersky Internet Security blocks any network activity of the attacking computer towards your computer.\n\nAnti-Spam - Anti-Spam integrates into the mail client installed on your computer and scans all incoming email messages for spam. All messages containing spam are marked with a special header. You can configure Anti-Spam to handle spam messages in a particular way (for example, delete them automatically or move them to a special folder).\n\nAnti-Phishing - Anti-Phishing allows checking URLs to find out if they are included in the list of phishing ones. This component is built into Web Anti-Virus, Anti-Spam, and IM Anti-Virus.\n\nAnti-Banner - Anti-Banner blocks ad banners on websites and in application interfaces.\n\nSafe Money - Safe Money provides protection of confidential data when using online banking services and payment systems, and prevents theft of assets when making online payments.\n\nParental Control - Parental Control is designed to protect children and teenagers from threats related to computer and Internet usage. Parental Control allows you to set flexible restrictions on access to web resources and applications for different users depending on their age. Parental Control also allows viewing statistical reports on activities exerted by controlled users.\n\nWHAT'S NEW\n\nKaspersky Internet Security provides the following new features:\n- To increase security of applications, Trusted Applications mode has been added.
