Later in life, he also wrote plays and essays. His two most famous works, the novels War and Peace and Anna Karenina, are acknowledged as two of the greatest novels of all time and a pinnacle of realist fiction. Many consider Tolstoy to have been one of the world's greatest novelists. Tolstoy is equally known for his complicated and paradoxical persona and for his extreme moralistic and ascetic views, which he adopted after a moral crisis and spiritual awakening in the 1870s, after which he also became noted as a moral thinker and social reformer.\nHis literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him in later life to become a fervent Christian anarchist and anarcho-pacifist. His ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as The Kingdom of God Is Within You, were to have a profound impact on such pivotal twentieth-century figures as Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.&quot; (Wikipedia)\n\n\n&quot;Even in translation, Tolstoy's voice comes through as clear and captivating.\nI started with War and Peace. I was hesitant to tackle this book's infamous length, but War and Peace proves that long does not necessarily mean arduous. I was drawn into world of 1805 in less than a page. From the first few lines of dialog, I felt I knew the characters engaged in the opening conversation, and I was anxious to learn more. It may have a lot of pages to turn, but War and Peace is a page turner, nonetheless.\nSo far, I have read War and Peace, Anna Karenina, and several of the included short stories and essays. I cannot get over how modern and fresh the writing feels 100 years after the author's death.\nIn addition to the sheer entertainment provided by the included fiction, this volume also includes seminal non-fiction writings that shaped the thinking of 20th century figures such as Mahatma Ghandi and Martin Luther King.\nI highly recommend this book.&quot; (Amazon Reviewer)\n\n\n\nThe works of Tolstoy in one giant collection with an active table of contents.\n\nAnna Karenina\nThe Awakening\nBethink Yourselves\nBoyhood\nThe Cause of it All\nChildhood\nA Confession\nThe Cossacks\nThe Death of Ivan Ilych\nFamily Happiness\nFather Sergius\nThe First Distiller\nThe Forged Coupon\nFruits of Culture\nKingdom of God is Within You\nA Letter to a Hindu\nThe Light Shines in Darkness\nThe Live Corpse\nMaster and Man\nOn the Significance of Science and Art\nThe Power of Darkness\nRedemption and Two Other Plays\nResurrection\nThoughts Evoked By the Census of Moscow\nTolstoy on Shakespeare\nWar and Peace\nWhat Men Live By\nWhat to Do?\nYouth","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2521ba596cb47671d12c92eeccd2f847b57006c2","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Works+of+Leo+Tolstoy.epub+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2521ba596cb47671d12c92eeccd2f847b57006c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,33,186,89,108,180,118,113,209,44,146,238,204,210,248,71,181,112,6,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
