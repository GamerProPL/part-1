Executive produced by Timbaland, it sees a selection of previously unreleased Jackson songs reworked by in-vogue producers such as Rodney Jerkins, StarGate, Jerome &quot;J-Roc&quot; Harmon, and John McClain. The album, said to have a slick and contemporary sound, features contributions from Mary J. Blidge, D'Angelo, and the Time's Jesse Johnson. [This Deluxe Edition includes a second disc containing the original versions of the songs and two documentary clips.] ~ John D.
