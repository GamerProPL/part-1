It is , in my opinion the best recording of the Bach Brandenburg I ever heard. It was never put out in CD (not in my country anyhow) Hope you like it as much as I Do. May it bring you as much pleasure as it brings me. Putting aside the Pirate Bay controverscy, my mission is to remaster vinyl LPs into mp3...those of which never were put out in CD...once the records are gone, the music is gone forever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e91cab719188c7577eb29a4ec55692be9659ad3f","amp;dn":"Bach+Brandenburg+Concertos+%28RCA+Victor%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e91cab719188c7577eb29a4ec55692be9659ad3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,28,171,113,145,136,199,87,126,178,154,78,197,86,146,190,150,89,173,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
