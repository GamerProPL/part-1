Titan, an independent republic, was originally colonized from Earth three generations earlier. Duncan's initial challenge is to prepare, physically and intellectually, for the 500-million-mile trip to Earth. Once there, he is caught up in a sweep of new experiences, including the social and political whirl in Washington, a strange visit to a carefully preserved ancient city once prominent in the 20th century, and a search for and meeting with a woman he loved since she visited Titan years before.\n\n\nRead by Roger Brown\nFormat: MP3\n\n\n============\n============\n[Tape rip]\n============\n============","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0723984f6307938e1b479afdab87f42cc4cdd817","amp;dn":"Arthur+C.+Clarke+-+Imperial+Earth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0723984f6307938e1b479afdab87f42cc4cdd817","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,35,152,79,99,7,147,142,27,71,154,253,171,135,244,44,196,205,216,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
