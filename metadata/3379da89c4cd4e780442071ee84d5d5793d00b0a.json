In his gripping and controversial new work, New York Times bestselling author Steven Pinker shows that despite the ceaseless news about war, crime, and terrorism, violence has actually been in decline over long stretches of history. Exploding myths about humankind's inherent violence and the curse of modernity, this ambitious book continues Pinker's exploration of the essence of human nature, mixing psychology and history to provide a remarkable picture of an increasingly enlightened world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3379da89c4cd4e780442071ee84d5d5793d00b0a","amp;dn":"Steven+Pinker+%28Epub%29The+Better+Angels+Of+Our+Nature++%5BQwerty80%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3379da89c4cd4e780442071ee84d5d5793d00b0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,121,218,137,196,205,78,120,4,66,7,30,232,77,93,87,147,208,11,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
