After three albums on independent labels earned the band a reputation as one of the formative influences on American alternative rock, creative tension led to Mascis firing Barlow, who turned to Sebadoh and Folk Implosion. His replacement, Mike Johnson came aboard for four major-label albums. Murph eventually quit, with Mascis taking over drum duties on the band's albums. Dinosaur Jr. disbanded in 1997, and the original lineup reformed in 2005, releasing three albums as of 2012.\nMascis's drawling vocals and distinct guitar sound, hearkening back to 1960s and '70s classic rock and characterized by high gain, extensive use of feedback and distortion, were highly influential in the alternative rock movement of the 1990s.\nSource:Wikipedia\n\n\n\nCountry: USA\nGenre: Alternative Rock\nQuality: 320 kbps\nAlbum List:\n\nDinosaur Jr\n\n(1985) Dinosaur Jr. - Dinosaur\n(1987) Dinosaur Jr. - You're Living All Over Me\n(1988) Dinosaur Jr. - Bug\n(1991) Dinosaur Jr. - Green Mind\n(1993) Dinosaur Jr. - Where You Been\n(1994) Dinosaur Jr. - Without A Sound\n(1997) Dinosaur Jr. - Hand It Over\n(2007) Dinosaur Jr. - Beyond\n(2009) Dinosaur Jr. - Farm\n(2012) Dinosaur Jr. - I Bet On Sky\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:907c0d1903c7d8a3d0bb37c421de750282f64a4e","amp;dn":"Dinosaur+Jr+%5BStudio+Albums+%40+320kbps%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"907c0d1903c7d8a3d0bb37c421de750282f64a4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,124,13,25,3,199,216,163,208,187,55,196,33,222,117,2,130,246,74,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
