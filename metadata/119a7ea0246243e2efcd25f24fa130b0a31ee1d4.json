For most of the last half of the 20th century, he was the superstar CEO's go-to guru, counseling everyone from Alfred Sloan to Andy Grove. And not in the fuzzy-headed, inspirational, bromide-spouting guru sense you see today. Drucker had no time for discussing who moved your cheese, and his insights were distinctive for being simultaneously crystalline yet deeply contrarian Ã¢â‚¬â€ and, frequently, a generation ahead of their time. Just one example: He was talking about the rise and importance of &quot;knowledge workers&quot; in the 1970s, when the phrase was a good two decades from common parlance. With 30 books to choose from, it's probably best to start with The Essential Drucker, a potent 26-piece collection selected by Drucker himself in 2001 as a comprehensive representation of his life's work. \n\n\nNote by uploader: The same book was uploaded by a PB user with username &quot;Qwerty80&quot;. That book had non-readable formatting. It was without any headings, paragraphs, bullet points and anchor texts. \n\nI've spent a whole day just to clean it up and make it readable. I want to thank &quot;Qwerty80&quot; for the availability of this book. It's a must read for anyone interested in Business, Economy, Sociology etc\n\nPlease Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:119a7ea0246243e2efcd25f24fa130b0a31ee1d4","amp;dn":"The+Essential+Drucker+%282001%29%2C+by+Peter+Drucker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"119a7ea0246243e2efcd25f24fa130b0a31ee1d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,154,126,160,36,98,67,226,239,205,37,242,79,161,48,176,163,30,225,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
