Heinlein, first published (in abridged form) as a serial in The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction (October, November 1959, as &quot;Starship Soldier&quot;) and published hardcover in December 1959.\n\nThe first-person narrative is about a young soldier from the Philippines named Juan &quot;Johnnie&quot; Rico and his exploits in the Mobile Infantry, a futuristic military service branch equipped with powered armor. Rico's military career progresses from recruit to non-commissioned officer and finally to officer against the backdrop of an interstellar war between mankind and an arachnoid species known as &quot;the Bugs&quot;. Rico and the other characters discuss moral and philosophical aspects of suffrage, civic virtue, juvenile delinquency, capital punishment, and war.
