Happy DJing!\n\nTRAKTOR PRO 2.6.6 introduced an issue which corrupts Playlists by removing the following content:\n\n-All Remix Sets\n\n-All tracks which the Relocate function is used for (either manually or by using the Consistency Check)\n\n-All tracks contained in a folder which is imported using the function Import Folder as Playlist\n\nNote that the tracks and Remix sets are only removed from the Playlists, not your Track Collection.  Native Instruments has now released TRAKTOR PRO 2.6.7., which fixes this issue. Unfortunately, the fix required the full deactivation of Metadata Sync with TRAKTOR DJ for this version. We strongly recommend 2.6.6 users to update to version 2.6.7 to avoid potential data loss. Version 2.6.6 has been withdrawn from Service Center and the Update Manager.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7100d87418897a0411f1d801c617844beaba7dd","amp;dn":"Traktor+Scratch+Pro+v2.6.7+Build+R337+MAC+OSX+w%2FCrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7100d87418897a0411f1d801c617844beaba7dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,16,13,135,65,136,151,160,65,31,29,128,28,97,120,68,190,171,167,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
