A People's History has become a major success and was a runner-up in 1980 for the National Book Award. It has been adopted for reading in some high schools and colleges across the United States and has been frequently revised, with the most recent edition covering events through 2005. In 2003, Zinn was awarded the Prix des Amis du Monde Diplomatique for the French version of this book, Une histoire populaire des Etats-Unis. Over one million copies have been sold.\n\nIn a 1998 interview, Zinn said he had set ''quiet revolution'' as his goal for writing A People's History. ''Not a revolution in the classical sense of a seizure of power, but rather from people beginning to take power from within the institutions. In the workplace, the workers would take power to control the conditions of their lives.''\n\n\nRunning Time: 34:12:51\n\n\nChapter 1  Columbus the Indians and Human Progress \nChapter 2  Drawing the Color Line \nChapter 3  Persons of Mean and Vile Condition\nChapter 4  Tyranny is Tyranny \nChapter 5  A Kind of Revolution \nChapter 6  The Intimately Oppressed \nChapter 7  As Long As Grass Grows or Water Runs \nChapter 8  We Take Nothing By Conquest Thank God \nChapter 9  Slavery Without Submission Emancipation Without Freedom \nChapter 10 The Other Civil War\nChapter 11 Robber Barons and Rebels\nChapter 12 The Empire and the People\nChapter 13 The Socialist Challenge\nChapter 14 War is the Health of the State\nChapter 15 Self-Help in Hard Times\nChapter 16 A People's War?\nChapter 17 'Or Does It Explode?'\nChapter 18 The Impossible Victory: Vietnam\nChapter 19 Surprises\nChapter 20 The Seventies: Under Control?\nChapter 21 Carter-Reagan-Bush: The Bipartisan Consensus\nChapter 22 The Unreported Resistance\nChapter 23 The Clinton Presidency\nChapter 24 The 2000 Election and the 'War On Terrorism'\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://photo.goodreads.com/books/1161517606l/2767.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://photo.goodreads.com/books/1161517606l/2767.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcd60768a9eb59cfa71eca4f5645ba34a3bebb0b","amp;dn":"Howard+Zinn+-+A+People%5C%27s+History+of+the+United+States+%5BUnabridg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcd60768a9eb59cfa71eca4f5645ba34a3bebb0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,214,7,104,169,235,89,207,167,30,202,79,86,69,186,52,163,190,187,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
