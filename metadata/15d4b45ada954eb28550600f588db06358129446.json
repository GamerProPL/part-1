BAFTA Award winner and Academy Award nominee Tomasz Baginski brings this key historical event to life, setting the stage for the story told in The Witcher 2. \n\n-------------------------------- \n-------------------------------- \n\nThe player is Geralt of Rivia, a professional monster slayer, a witcher. Entangled in the political turmoil that engulfed Temeria, Geralt helped quell the rebellion of the Order of the Flaming Rose. Soon after, he saved King Foltest?s life when the monarch was attacked by a witcher-like assassin. He continues to protect the king, serving as his bodyguard as Foltest strives to bring peace to his kingdom. The Order?s last bastions have yielded to the royal army, yet one more task remains - the Baroness La Valette announced her secession from the realm, and her fortress must be taken. A month after the attempted assassination, Foltest?s armies stand at the gates of La Valette Castle, preparing for a final assault. Still at Foltest?s side, Geralt is among them, unable to begin his personal quest to discover the mysterious assassin?s origin and identity? \n\n-------------------------------- \n-------------------------------- \n\nVersion: 3.0.1.17 \nFrom GOG.com \n-- DRM Free \n\nSFV checks of all the files are inside the &quot;misc&quot; folder. \nThe GOG.com extras are inside the &quot;extras&quot; folder. \nThe game installation files are in the &quot;setup&quot; folder. \n\nMin requirements: \n\nOS: Windows XP/Vista/7 \nProcessor: Intel 2.2 GHz Dual-Core or AMD 2.5 GHz Dual-Core \nMemory: 1.5 GB (Win XP), 2GB (Win Vista/Win 7) \nGraphics: GeForce 8800 (512 MB) or Radeon HD3850 (512 MB) \nHard Drive: 16GB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15d4b45ada954eb28550600f588db06358129446","amp;dn":"Witcher+2+Enhanced+Edition+GOG.com","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15d4b45ada954eb28550600f588db06358129446","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,212,180,90,218,149,78,178,133,80,96,15,88,141,176,99,88,18,148,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
