A visionary financier&amp;#039;s biotechnology company has succeeded in cloning these extinct reptiles. Fifteen different species, presumably incapable of breeding, are now placidly roaming around, but Jurassic Park&amp;#039;s resident mathematician, an expert in chaos theory, predicts that the animals&amp;#039; behavior is inherently unstable. When a rival genetics firm attempts to steal frozen dinosaur embryos, things go haywire. Two cute American kids, eight-year-old Tina and 11-year-old Tim, a safari guide from Kenya and a Denver paleontologist set things aright--almost. Though the dinosaurs here are more interesting than the people, Crichton ( The Andromeda Strain ) ingeniously interweaves details of genetic engineering, computer wizardry and current scientific controversy over dinosaurs to fashion a scary, creepy, mesmerizing techno-thriller with teeth. It can be read as a thought-provoking fable about technological hubris and the hazards of bioengineering.\n\n\nPLEASE SEED WHEN YOU FINISH THE DOWNLOAD.\n\nEnjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79982db0ae158a61c49bc5b6c00183c86ab4be3f","amp;dn":"Jurassic+Park+-+Michael+Crichton+%5BAudiobook%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79982db0ae158a61c49bc5b6c00183c86ab4be3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,152,45,176,174,21,138,97,196,155,197,182,192,1,131,200,106,180,190,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
