The film is adapted from the novel Falling Angel by William Hjortsberg, and is generally faithful to the novel with the exceptions being the introduction of a child of Epiphany Proudfoot conceived at a voodoo ceremony by &quot;the Gods&quot;, and that the novel never leaves New York City, whereas the film opts for a New Orleans ending, and has a more somber tone.A highly atmospheric film, Angel Heart combines elements of film noir, hard-boiled detective stories and horror.\n\nThe movie opens in January, 1955. Mickey Rourke plays Harry Angel, a seedy private investigator in New York City. Louis Cyphre (De Niro) hires Angel to locate Johnny Favorite, a popular big band crooner who was severely injured in World War II and hospitalized with profound neurological trauma. Cyphre discovers that the hospital may have falsified Favorite&amp;#039;s records and wants Angel to find out what happened, as Favorite owed a debt to Cyphre.But there&amp;#039;s more to the case than initially appears, as the debt in question is Favorite&amp;#039;s soul, and Cyphre is not human ? his very name, Louis Cyphre, is a play on words, sounding like Lucifer when said out loud. His true objective is strongly hinted at by a scene in which Cyphre carefully shells and salts a hard-boiled egg before slowly biting down into it with obvious relish ? after remarking that in many cultures it represents the soul.\n\nAngel Heart gained attention and controversy even before its release. Bonet was previously known for her role on the family-oriented The Cosby Show, and her extended, graphic and blood-drenched love scene with Rourke required being trimmed of several seconds to secure the film an &amp;#039;R&amp;#039; rating on initial release.\n\nDirected by Alan Parker \nProduced by Elliott Kastner\nAlan Marshall \nWritten by Novel:\nWilliam Hjortsberg\nScreenplay:\nAlan Parker \nStarring Mickey Rourke\nRobert De Niro\nLisa Bonet\nCharlotte Rampling \n\nRelease date(s) March 6, 1987 \nRunning time 113 minutes\n\nFormat.......................: NTSC\nResolution...................: 624 x 352\nCodec........................: XviD, 2 Pass mode\nBitrate......................: Avg. 900 kBit/s\nFormat.......................: MP3\nChannels.....................: 2 Channels (Surround Stereo)\nSampleRate...................: 48000 Hz\nBitrate......................: 128 kBit/s\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46e762dccd7225a4a918dc0d8ca283738afb3aa4","amp;dn":"Angel+Heart+%281987%29+%5BDVDrip+%28XviD%29%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46e762dccd7225a4a918dc0d8ca283738afb3aa4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,231,98,220,205,114,37,164,169,24,220,13,140,162,131,115,138,251,58,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
