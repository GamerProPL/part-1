It has since been recognized as one of the most influential records in the history of popular music and one of the best albums of the 1960s, including songs such as &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot; and &quot;God Only Knows&quot;. Pet Sounds was created several months after Brian Wilson had quit touring with the band in order to focus his attention on writing and recording. In it, he wove elaborate layers of vocal harmonies, coupled with sound effects and unconventional instruments such as bicycle bells, buzzing organs, harpsichords, flutes, Electro-Theremin, dog whistles, trains, Hawaiian-sounding string instruments, Coca-Cola cans and barking dogs, along with the more usual keyboards and guitars.\nAlthough Pet Sounds was met with strong sales abroad, reaching number two in the UK, it charted lower in the US than the majority of the band's preceding albums, peaking at number ten on the Billboard 200. Its initial release was not awarded gold certification by the RIAA until 2000 despite eligibility since midÃ¢â‚¬â€œ1967. A heralding album in the emerging psychedelic rock style, Pet Sounds has been championed and emulated for its dramatic and revolutionary baroque instrumentation. It has been ranked at number one in several music magazines' lists of greatest albums of all time, including New Musical Express, The Times and Mojo Magazine. It was ranked number two in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list\n\n\nTracklist:\n01 Wouldn't It Be Nice (Stereo Mix).flac\n02 You Still Believe In Me (Stereo Mix).flac\n03 That's Not Me (Stereo Mix).flac\n04 Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder) (Stereo Mix).flac\n06 I'm Waiting For The Day (Stereo Mix).flac\n07 Let's Go Away For Awhile (Stereo Mix).flac\n08 Sloop John B (Stereo Mix).flac\n09 God Only Knows (Stereo Mix).flac\n10 I Know There's An Answer (Stereo Mix).flac\n11 Here Today (Stereo Mix).flac\n12 I Just Wasn't Made For These Times (Stereo Mix).flac\n13 Pet Sounds (Stereo Mix).flac\n14 Caroline No (Stereo Mix).flac\n15 Hang On To Your Ego (mono).flac\n\n\nGeneral:\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Psychedelic rock, baroque pop, psychedelic pop\nSource:CD \nFormat : FLAC/tracks+.cue\n\nAudio\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 883 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nWriting library : libFLAC 1.2.1 (UTC 2007-09-17)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af20418ec75efd2dcb032e36233c92edaee06b2e","amp;dn":"%282001%29+The+Beach+Boys+-+Pet+Sounds+%28Remaster+Stereo%29+%5BFLAC%2B.cue%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af20418ec75efd2dcb032e36233c92edaee06b2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,32,65,142,199,94,253,45,203,3,46,54,35,60,146,237,174,224,107,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
