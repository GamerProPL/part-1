Last Ride\n\nLee Fields is a bona-fide, 100%, unadulterated, pure, gut-bucket soul singer. His &quot;legendary&quot; status owes to his undeniably solid series of rare 7&quot; singles (and one LP) recorded and released on his own independent labels in the 70s. Madlib recently jacked his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFlim FlamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ drums for the TV on the Radio remix he produced. Now, the New York label/production team Truth &amp; Soul currently in the studio with Aloe Blacc are ready to bring him to light with a brand new album of beat-heavy, deep soul ballads that will show soul-revivalists the world over what real soul is.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨Recorded over four years, Lee Fields &amp; The Expressions have successfully created a unique and personal sound that can hold court with the bands they set out to emulate. However, what theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve created in the process goes beyond just a carbon copy of a sweet soul music from the 60's and early 70's.  The formula has remained the same but the style has been adapted for the ears of youngsters whose experiences with soul began with Amy, not Al, Otis and Marvin. Thirty years of retrospection has colored this cross-generational melding of the minds. It sounds odd on paper, but the results are classic: hip hop-reared record collectors come full circle to produce an album of beautiful soul music with one of the progenitors who made it all possible.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:347481de1d72a48733142fe6786c9e6ee2793bc5","amp;dn":"Lee+Fields+%26+The+Expressions+-+My+World+%282009%29+%5B320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"347481de1d72a48733142fe6786c9e6ee2793bc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,116,129,222,29,114,164,135,51,20,47,230,120,108,158,110,226,121,59,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
