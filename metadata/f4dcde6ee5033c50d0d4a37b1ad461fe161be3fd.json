It is also a much bigger game and a classic RPG at heart, with a complex scenario based on time travel, dozens of characters with their own backgrounds and ambitions and vastly different gameplay styles that are linked to the story and the playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions.\n\nFull of humor and references to classic games, the aptly named Evoland 2, A Slight Case of Spacetime Continuum Disorder brings a truly epic and extraordinary adventure, unlike anything youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever played before!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4dcde6ee5033c50d0d4a37b1ad461fe161be3fd","amp;dn":"Evoland+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4dcde6ee5033c50d0d4a37b1ad461fe161be3fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,220,222,110,229,3,60,80,208,212,163,123,26,212,97,254,22,27,227,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
