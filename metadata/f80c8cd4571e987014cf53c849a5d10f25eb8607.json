His 2012 album, Black Radio won the Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Album at the 55th Grammy Awards. Glasper's music can be described as &quot;experiments with space, rhythm and chord textures&quot;, creating a vast array of sound. He has said that he tries to make the music flow in a way more like a hip-hop beat, trying to always leave the music open for someone to rap over.\n\n01 Lift Off (feat.
