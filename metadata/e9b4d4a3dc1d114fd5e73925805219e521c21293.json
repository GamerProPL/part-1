The 12-song set was recorded over this year in New York with the Budos BandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tommy Brenneck and in Nashville, with the Black KeysÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ drummer Patrick Carney. Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Our main influences [this time] are pretty traditional,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ bassist Jared Swilley tells Rolling Stone. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roots music.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nThe band promised earlier that thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more of a southern rock and country vibe within Rainbow, but the Black LipsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ wild side is certainly prevelant.\nBoys in the Woods is an ode to Lynyrd Skynyrd and growing up in Atlanta that Swilley says is about Ã¢â‚¬Å“doing bathtub drugs and drinking bathtub gin.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Others were written the day they were recorded and one in particular, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Smiling,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ chroniclesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nSwilleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brief stay in prison last year. Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½[That song is] about how going to jail sucks, because the florescent lights make it hard to sleep, and you have to share five cigarettes with ten other guys all ducking in a corner smoking cigarettes,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“[And] how you have to call your mom to bail you out. I wanted to write a song about Gucci Mane but I ended up writing it about myself.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nOver the last 15 years, the Black Lips have remained successful due to a committed ethic to non-stop touring and a constant desire to change things up in the studio. But as they forge on, recording hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t become routine by any means. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think making records gets any easier,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Swilley says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It almost seems like the first one is the easiest because you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really used many ideas at that point so almost everything is new to you.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9b4d4a3dc1d114fd5e73925805219e521c21293","amp;dn":"Black+Lips+-+Underneath+the+Rainbow+%282014%29+MP3%40320kbps+Beolab170","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9b4d4a3dc1d114fd5e73925805219e521c21293","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,180,212,163,220,29,17,79,213,231,57,37,128,82,25,229,33,194,18,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
