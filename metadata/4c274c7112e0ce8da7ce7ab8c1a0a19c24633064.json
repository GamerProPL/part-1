Hall - The Secret Destiny of America - pdf [TKRG]\r\n\r\nManly P Hall was a phenomenon, famous in the inter-war years for his mysteriously-acquired and voluminous knowledge of a wide swathe of esoteric subjects, everything from Tarot to the Teachings of Kabbalah, from Pythagorean Mathematics to the esotericism of the plays of Shakespeare. In 'The Secret Destiny of America', Hall reveals how shadowy mystical orders lay behind the seemingly fortuitous birth of the United States. Bringing together such forgotten fragments of history as Akhenaton's monotheism, Christopher Columbus' true identity, the London prophecy delivered the year of Washington's birth, and the 'Mysterious Stranger' who swayed the signers of the Declaration of Independence, Manly P Hall gives a surprisingly plausible account of the American nation as an occult experiment in enlightened self-government and religious Liberty","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c274c7112e0ce8da7ce7ab8c1a0a19c24633064","amp;dn":"Manly+P.+Hall+-+The+Secret+Destiny+of+America+-+pdf+%5BTKRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c274c7112e0ce8da7ce7ab8c1a0a19c24633064","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,39,76,113,18,224,206,141,167,206,122,184,193,160,161,156,36,99,48,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
