These chapters emphasize the relationship between problems encountered with the use of feed water, the processes developed to address them, the operation of the required plants and solutions actually implemented. This compendium will assist designers, engineers and investigators to select the process and plant configuration that are most appropriate for the particular feed water to be used, for the geographic region considered, as well as for the characteristics required of the treated water produced. This survey offers a comprehensive, hierarchical and logical assessment of the entire desalination industry. It starts with the worldwide scarcity of water and energy, continues with the thermal - and membrane-based processes and, finally, presents the design and operation of large and small desalination plants. As such, it covers all the scientific, technological and economical aspects of this critical industry, not disregarding its environmental and social points of view. One of InTech's books has received widespread praise across a number of key publications. Desalination, Trends and Technologies (Ed. Schorr, M. 2011) has been reviewed in Corrosion Engineering, Science &amp; Technology Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the official magazine for the Institute of Materials, Minerals &amp; Mining, and Taylor &amp; Francis's Desalination Publications. Praised for its Ã¢â‚¬Å“multi-faceted content [which] contributes to enrich it,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and described as Ã¢â‚¬Å“an essential companion...[that] enables the reader to gain a deeper understanding of the desalination industry,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ this book is testament to the quality improvements we have been striving towards over the last twelve months","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0146dac351f21e3cd4d6640eaac962bd456f54ce","amp;dn":"Desalination%2C+Trends+and+Technologies+-+Michael+Schorr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0146dac351f21e3cd4d6640eaac962bd456f54ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,70,218,195,81,242,30,60,212,214,100,14,170,201,98,189,69,111,84,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
