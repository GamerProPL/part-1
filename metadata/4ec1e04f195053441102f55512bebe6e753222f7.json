But one night things take a bad turn when Derek unintentionally offends Odette, who then refuses to marry him if he can&amp;#039;t prove that he loves her for who she is and not just her beauty. Odette and her father are then attacked by Lord Rothbart, a vengeful sorcerer who was cast out of William&amp;#039;s kingdom when he plotted against the king.
