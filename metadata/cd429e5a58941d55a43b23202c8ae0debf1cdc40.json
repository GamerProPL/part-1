A band comprised of the four Sierota siblings, the California-based Echosmith includes lead singer Sydney, guitarist/vocalist Jamie, bassist/vocalist Noah, and drummer Graham. Working with producer Mike Elizondo and songwriter Jeffery David, the band's freshman effort is impressively filled out with radio-ready songs that combine U2's chiming guitars, Fleetwood Mac's harmonies, and Killers-style neo-new wave production. In that sense, Echosmith will also draw favorable comparisons to such similarly inclined acts as Paramore, Kitten, and Britain's Two Door Cinema Club. Cuts like the romantic title track, the sparkling &quot;Let's Love,&quot; and the bubbly &quot;Come with Me&quot; are all infectious and smartly produced, and tend to stick in your head long after the album ends. There is a brilliant lightness to these songs -- nothing ever feels too thought-out. While this doesn't lend a ton of depth to the album, with the members of Echosmith barely in their twenties and lead singer Sydney just sixteen, it only seems logical to assume that there's room for growth. And based on Talking Dreams, that growth will be a pleasure to witness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd429e5a58941d55a43b23202c8ae0debf1cdc40","amp;dn":"Echosmith+-+Talking+Dreams+%28Deluxe%29+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd429e5a58941d55a43b23202c8ae0debf1cdc40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,66,158,90,88,148,29,85,164,59,35,32,44,138,224,222,191,28,220,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
