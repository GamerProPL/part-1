It is April 1912,  \n                    and news arrives of the sinking of the Titanic  \n                    with the loss of Downton's heir James and his  \n                    son Patrick. The Dowager Countess Violet hopes  \n                    that the title and estate will pass on to the  \n                    current Earl Robert's oldest daughter Mary, who  \n                    was in line to marry Patrick. But Robert, whose  \n                    wife Cora's money is intimately tied up in the  \n                    estate, decides not to name Mary his heir, and  \n                    after discovering that a distant cousin is set  \n                    to inherit instead, invites the young man to  \n                    Downton. Meanwhile, new valet John Bates is  \n                    given a hard time by the staff as an old war  \n                    injury threatens his job at the stately home.  \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                        Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45cb8716faedc1035b4364cfa95198cb5f500953","amp;dn":"Downton.Abbey.S01E01.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45cb8716faedc1035b4364cfa95198cb5f500953","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,203,135,22,250,237,193,3,91,67,100,207,169,81,152,203,95,80,9,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
