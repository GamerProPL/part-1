Since antispyware removal is a much more difficult task than simply detecting it, it comes as no surprise that this softwareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s detection capabilities supersede its removal performance. The antispyware software also frequently updates to ensure it can continue to protect your PC against emerging threats as well.\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find little beyond this antispyware toolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s malware protection. While top-tier antispyware software works hard to protect all points of entry on your PC, Spyware Doctor primarily focuses on potential browser exploits. To keep your PC even safer, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to see the software also scan email attachments and removable media such as USB drives for potential threats. Doing so may help boost the softwareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s overall performance.\n\nAlso missing from Spyware DoctorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s functionality is the ability to run reports. While not necessary for effective malware protection, reporting options would likely widen the softwareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s appeal to include advanced users who prefer manual, hands-on PC protection and are interested to know more about the nature of found threats.\n\nIf you run into trouble either installing or running the software, Spyware Doctor is supplemented with decent help and support. Its manufacturer, PC Tools, provides online documentation and a knowledgebase that you can peruse. You can also contact the company via live chat or email, but no phone support is available.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperating Systems Supported:\n\nMicrosoft Windows 7 (32bit, 64bit)\nWindows Vista SP1+ (32bit, 64bit)\nWindows XP SP2+ (32bit)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCOMMENTS ARE APPRECIATED\nKEEP SEEDING!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a65ee27cb94e8910ee5ba7d77fedc3eb804166d4","amp;dn":"Spyware+Doctor+2012+%2B+Serial%7E%7E%28TIMETHIEF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a65ee27cb94e8910ee5ba7d77fedc3eb804166d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,94,226,124,185,78,137,16,238,91,167,215,127,237,195,235,128,65,102,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
