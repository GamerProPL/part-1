I see you're reading the back of my book. This tells me that you either:\nA) are hoping to find a brief summary of what to expect from a how-to book by Sterling Archer, the world's greatest secret agent, or B) don't know how books work.\n\nIf your answer was &quot;A,&quot; your best bet is probably the table of contents, which is where you'll find the &quot;contents&quot; of this book listened in a convenient, easy-to-read &quot;table&quot; format. So maybe go check that out for a minute and then come back here. I'll wait...\n\nPretty cool, right? What other book will teach you how to dress properly and how to drive an elephant? How to field strip an AK-47 properly and how to haggle with a Thai prostitute--in her own native tongue? How to pilot an airboat and how to make about a million delicious cocktails, including a Molotov one? How to kill a guy and how to prepare a fabulous brunch? Plus how to do tons of other stuff that I forgot, but that is nonetheless probably in this book (which, to be honest, I really only kinda skimmed).\n\nSo if you want to learn more about how to be more--or at all--like Sterling Archer, the world's greatest secret agent, quit smearing your greasy fingerprints all over this book and buy it. For one thing, I really need the royalties. For another thing, the last time I checked, this wasn't a damn library.\n\n(Note: If your answer was &quot;B,&quot; this probably isn't the book you want to start with.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d97e8cc8a10fa571df1a934619bd7a39216b5410","amp;dn":"Sterling+Archer%2C+How+to+Archer%2C+The+Ultimate+Guide+to+Espionage%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d97e8cc8a10fa571df1a934619bd7a39216b5410","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,126,140,200,161,15,165,113,223,26,147,70,25,189,122,57,33,107,84,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
