The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound, rooted in blues and psychedelia on their early albums, has earned them recognition as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music.\r\n\r\nRolling Stone magazine described them as &quot;the heaviest band of all time&quot;, &quot;the biggest band of the Seventies&quot;, and &quot;unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history&quot;. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995; the museum's biography of the band states that they were &quot;as influential&quot; during the 1970s as the Beatles were during the 1960s.\r\n\r\nLed Zeppelin remain one of the most bootlegged artists in the history of rock music. analogkid agrees completely.\r\n\r\nYear:\t2016\r\nStyle:\tHard Rock\r\nCountry:\tUnited Kingdom\r\nFormat:\t320 mp3\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\nAdded:4-\t\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTracks: \r\n\r\n   CD1\r\n01.
