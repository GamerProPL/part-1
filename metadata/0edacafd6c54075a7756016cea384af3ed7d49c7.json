Jimmy Somerville's soaring tenor may take some getting used to, but the songs, many of them dealing with homophobia and alienation (none more eloquently than &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot;), are compelling vignettes about the vagaries of life as a gay man. \r\nCynics predisposed to dismissing entire genres of music based on trendiness or a limited appeal (&quot;dance music is for dancing, not listening&quot;) miss the point in lumping this in with more mindless forays into techno or neo-disco. \r\nAs the Pet Shop Boys (the world's greatest disco band) proved a few years later, you can have substantive content and wrap it up in a compelling, visceral, dance-oriented package. Few bands understood this better, or earlier, than Bronski Beat. (AMG)\r\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/pZiDYO0.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n01. Why?    [4:04]\r\n02. Ain't Necessarily So    [4:43]\r\n03.
