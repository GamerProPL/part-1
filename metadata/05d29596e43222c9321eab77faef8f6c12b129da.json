Those achievements are all the more astonishing given the fact that the group barely held together through the estimated 800 hours it took to record DÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  Vu and scarcely functioned as a group for most of that time. DÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  Vu worked as an album, a product of four potent musical talents who were all ascending to the top of their game coupled with some very skilled production, engineering, and editing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05d29596e43222c9321eab77faef8f6c12b129da","amp;dn":"Crosby%2C+Stills%2C+Nash+%26+Young+-+Deja+Vu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05d29596e43222c9321eab77faef8f6c12b129da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,210,149,150,228,50,34,201,50,30,171,119,250,239,143,108,18,177,41,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
