As the leading textbook of modern orthopaedics for over 50 years, this book is a testament to the late Alan Apley's skills as a teacher, and the care and forethought he brought to the presentation of the content.\n\nThe current authors have developed and extended this foundation to produce a thoroughly modern textbook of orthopaedic surgery, bringing contemporary expertise while retaining the book's characteristic philosophy and approach. They are joined by a selection of expert contributors from around the world who provide added material on a wide variety of subjectsÃ¢â‚¬â€ including radiology, open fractures, neuromuscular disorders, and inflammatory arthropathies.\n\nThis ninth edition echoes its predecessors in following Apley's approach to the orthopaedic patient. As before, the work is divided into three sections: General Orthopaedics, Regional Orthopaedics, and Fractures and Joint Injuries. The material has been fully updated and revised and includes more than 1,000 illustrations.\n\nApley's System's wide readership of practicing orthopaedic surgeons, postgraduate trainees and residents in orthopaedics and general surgery, A&amp;E specialists, and physiotherapists is evidence of the authors' ability to instruct and inspire. The book is a truly fitting introduction to modern-day orthopaedics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3c43dfcd5dee1d44e400ecafd7f10326d70651e","amp;dn":"Apley%26rsquo%3Bs+System+of+Orthopaedics+and+Fractures+9th+Ed+%5BPDF%5D%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3c43dfcd5dee1d44e400ecafd7f10326d70651e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,196,61,252,213,222,225,212,78,64,14,202,253,127,16,50,109,112,101,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
