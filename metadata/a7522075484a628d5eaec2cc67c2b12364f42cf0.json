Then Fuseling's Fantasy Clutter Books, Scrolls, and accessories is here for you!  This massive set includes an epic array of individual props, smart props, multi prop groupings, multiple material presets for every prop, and a ton of shaders! This set gives you the tools to add a lot or add a little.  The individual props are optimized with geometry where it's needed and less where it's not, so you can add many of them to a scene. The multi prop groupings let you quickly add, in three different color schemes each, a range of options from small groupings of props all the way up to an entire room's worth. With lots of attention to detail, including open and closed versions of all of the books and scrolls, furniture to go with the props, and morphs for many of the props, this fun set can help set your fantasy scenes apart!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7522075484a628d5eaec2cc67c2b12364f42cf0","amp;dn":"DAZ3D+-+FSL+Fantasy+Clutter+Books+Scrolls+%26amp%3B+Accessories","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7522075484a628d5eaec2cc67c2b12364f42cf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,82,32,117,72,74,98,141,94,174,194,204,103,194,177,35,100,244,44,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
