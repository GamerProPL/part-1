From his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, to years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime- ridden city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a legendary school of magic, The Name of the Wind is a masterpiece that transports readers into the body and mind of a wizard. It is a high-action novel written with a poet's hand, a powerful coming-of-age story of a magically gifted young man, told through his eyes: to read this book is to be the hero.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a8d02fef7eed7045b710236a7e34752f2f181a9","amp;dn":"The+Name+of+the+Wind++by+Patrick+Rothfuss+%5BePub%5D+-+Traitor+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a8d02fef7eed7045b710236a7e34752f2f181a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,141,2,254,247,238,215,4,91,113,2,54,167,227,71,82,242,241,129,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
