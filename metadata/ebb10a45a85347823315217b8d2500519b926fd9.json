Gladwell argues that the true story of success is very different, and that if we want to understand how some people thrive, we should spend more time looking around them-at such things as their family, their birthplace, or even their birth date. And in revealing that hidden logic, Gladwell presents a fascinating and provocative blueprint for making the most of human potential.\n\nIn The Tipping Point Gladwell changed the way we understand the world. In Blink he changed the way we think about thinking. In OUTLIERS he transforms the way we understand success.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebb10a45a85347823315217b8d2500519b926fd9","amp;dn":"Outliers+-+Malcolm+Gladwell.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebb10a45a85347823315217b8d2500519b926fd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,177,10,69,168,83,71,130,51,21,33,123,141,37,0,81,155,146,111,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
