It's a soundtrack and plays like a \n\nsoundtrack, with many cuts from current stars and new artists (several \n\nassociated with Eminem's fledgling Shady imprint), plus a couple of previously \n\nreleased tracks, most of it very high quality, whether it's a hard-hitting \n\nJay-Z, a sultry Macy Gray, or Taryn Manning's Boomkat's sexy slow burn &quot;Wasting \n\nMy Time.&quot; Sure, there's a couple of tracks that fall flat -- Young Zee and Obie \n\nTrice feel strained -- but it all flows well, and it's all strong. But it's \n\nalso all overshadowed by four blindingly great new songs from Eminem (four and \n\na half, if you count his show-stealing appearance on D-12's &quot;Rap Game&quot;), all \n\nillustrating a step forward from The Eminem Show, even if they work a familiar \n\npseudo-biographical ground. What impresses is not just the wordplay and \n\ndelivery, but the music itself -- fuller, richer than anything on his previous \n\nrecords, appropriately cinematic in scope and pushing Eminem toward new \n\nheights. The opening track and first single &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; is easily equaled \n\nby the title song with its layered pianos, while &quot;Rabbit Run&quot; is nearly as \n\ngood. Hearing these, it's hard not to greedily hunger for a full album of this, \n\nbut the soundtrack is excellent as is and these new Eminem cuts make it a \n\nnecessary purchase.\nTracks:\n\n   1.
