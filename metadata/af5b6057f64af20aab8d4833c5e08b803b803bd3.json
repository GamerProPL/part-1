The band has had numerous personnel changes, but its core lineup of Haynes, Leary, and drummer King Coffey has been consistent since 1983. Teresa Nervosa served as second drummer from 1983 to 1985, 1986 to 1989, and 2009. The band has also employed a variety of bass players, most notably Bill Jolly and Jeff Pinkus.\n\nRooted in the 1980s hardcore punk scene, Butthole Surfers quickly became known for their chaotic and disturbing live shows, black comedy, and a sound that incorporated elements of psychedelia, noise, punk rock and, later, electronica, as well as their use of sound manipulation and tape editing. The Buttholes have a well-reported appetite for recreational drugs, an evident influence on their sound.\n\nAlthough they were respected by their peers and attracted a devoted fan base, Butthole Surfers had little commercial success until 1996's Electriclarryland. The album contained the hit single &quot;Pepper&quot; which climbed to number one on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart that year\n\n1983 - Butthole Surfers EP &amp; Live PCPPEP (2 Disc)\n\n1985 - Psychic...
