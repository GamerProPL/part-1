Mixing his bad-boy good looks with an appealing blend of pop hooks, punk attitude, and a dance beats, Idol quickly rocketed to stardom, before hard living derailed his career and almost proved fatal. Born William Michael Albert Broad on November 30, 1955, in Middlesex, England, the youngster relocated with his family for a brief spell to New York, before returning back to England. After a stint at Sussex University only last a year, Broad found himself as part of a group of teen punk rockers who befriended and followed the Sex Pistols, known as &quot;the Bromley Contingent&quot; (a member of this colorful group of characters was Siouxsie Sioux, eventual leader of Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees).\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Dancing With Myself (EP Version)\n02.Mony Mony (2001 Digital Remaster)\n03.Hot In The City (2001 Digital Remaster)\n04.White Wedding Part 1 (2001 Remaster)\n05.Rebel Yell (1999 Digital Remaster)\n06.Eyes Without A Face (1999 Remaster)\n07.Flesh For Fantasy (1999 Digital Remaster)\n08.Catch My Fall (1999 Digital Remaster)\n09.To Be a Lover (2001 Digital Remaster)\n10.Don't Need A Gun (Single Edit)\n11.Sweet Sixteen (2001 Digital Remaster)\n12.Cradle Of Love (2001 Digital Remaster)\n13.L.
