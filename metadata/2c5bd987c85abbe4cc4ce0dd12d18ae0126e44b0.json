Even after a string of hits, the singer never quite managed to break into the mainstream, although he seemed poised for international stardom during the late '60s/early '70s. The singer was born in St. Catherine, Jamaica, on April 1, 1948, with the less prosaic name James Chambers. His talent was evident from childhood, and he began his career appearing at local shows and parish fairs. Feeling ready for the big time at the age of 14, he moved to Kingston and took the surname Cliff to express the heights he intended on reaching. Cliff recorded two unsuccessful singles before he was spotted by Derrick Morgan, who brought him to Leslie Kong. His first single for the budding producer, &quot;Hurricane Hattie,&quot; was an instant hit. Unusually, Cliff remained with Kong until the producer's death; most Jamaican artists flit from studio to studio. The singer's loyalty was rewarded, however, by a string of follow-up hits. In the early years, the pair helped set the ska scene alight, both in Jamaica and in Britain, where the singer's singles were picked up by Island Records. &quot;Miss Jamaica,&quot; &quot;King of Kings,&quot; &quot;One Eyed Jacks,&quot; and &quot;Pride and Passion&quot; have since become classics of the original ska era.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tReggae\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Vietnam.mp3\n02.Born To Win.mp3\n03.My Love Is Solid As A Rock.mp3\n04.Don't Let It Die.mp3\n05.Many Rivers To Cross.mp3\n06.On My Life.mp3\n07.Music Maker.mp3\n08.My People.mp3\n09.Wonderful World, Beautiful People.mp3\n10.Fundamental Reggay.mp3\n11.I Want To Know.mp3\n12.Actions Speak Louder Than Words.mp3\n13.Sufferin' In The Land.mp3\n14.Under The Sun, Moon And Stars.mp3\n15.House Of Exile.mp3\n16.Every Tub.mp3\n17.Come Into My Life.mp3\n18.Oh Jamaica.mp3\n19.I've Been Dead 400 Years.mp3\n20.Give A Little, Take A Little.mp3\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c5bd987c85abbe4cc4ce0dd12d18ae0126e44b0","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Cliff+-+The+Best+Of+%282001%29+Reggae+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c5bd987c85abbe4cc4ce0dd12d18ae0126e44b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,91,217,135,200,90,187,228,204,76,224,221,18,209,138,224,18,110,68,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
