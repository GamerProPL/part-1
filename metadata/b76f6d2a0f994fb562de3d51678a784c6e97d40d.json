Police psychoanalyst Dr. Michael Glass is called for examining Tramell, and is intrigued by the seductive and manipulative woman. On the other hand , his friend Det. Roy Washburn is sure Tramell is guilty. Tramell asks Glass to treat her for her 'risk addiction' problem, and with each therapy session , Glass gets more and more suspicious about her intentions. As more and more murders are committed, including that of Glass's ex-wife, Glass becomes obsessed with proving Tramell's guilt even though the evidence is contradictory .                \r\n\r\nYear: 2006                \r\nDirector: Michael Caton-Jones                \r\nWriters: Leora Barish, Henry Bean, Joe Eszterhas                \r\nStars: Stan Collymore, Sharon Stone, Neil Maskell, David Thewlis, Jan Chappell, David Morrissey, Terence Harvey, Hugh Dancy, Ellen Thomas, Mark Sangster                \r\nGenres: Crime, Drama, Mystery, Thriller                \r\nLanguage: English                \r\n\r\nRELEASE.....................: Basic.Instinct.2.2006.720p.BluRay.x264.VPPV\r\nVIDEO.......................: 1000 kbps  \r\nCODEC.......................: x264\r\nRESOLUTION..................: 1280x534                \r\nFRAME RATE..................: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.......................: 2 Channel / AAC / 192kbps                \r\nFILE SIZE / FORMAT..........: 977 MiB / MP4\r\nSOURCE......................: BluRay                \r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nPoster:  \nhttp://snap.vppv.la/basic-instinct-2/2006/basic-instinct-2-2006-poster.jpg               \r\n\r\nWarning!!!
