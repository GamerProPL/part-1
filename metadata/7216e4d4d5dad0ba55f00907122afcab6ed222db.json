Johnny Depp stars as Ichabod Crane, a seemingly hapless constable from New York City who is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to solve the mystery of the decapitations that are plaguing the town. Crane is a bumbling sort, with a tremendous faith in science over mysticism, and he comes up against town secrets, bewitching women, and a number of bodies missing heads. Christina Ricci is Katrina Van Tassel, the offbeat love interest who alternately charms and frightens Crane.\n\n  Starring: Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien.\n\n  Directed by: Tim Burton.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 45min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 704 x 416\n\n  Frame Rate: 29fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7216e4d4d5dad0ba55f00907122afcab6ed222db","amp;dn":"Sleepy+Hollow+%281999%29+%28Johnny+Depp%2C+Christina+Ricci%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7216e4d4d5dad0ba55f00907122afcab6ed222db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,22,228,212,213,218,208,186,85,240,9,7,18,42,252,171,110,210,34,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
