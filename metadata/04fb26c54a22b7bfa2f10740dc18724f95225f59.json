A master of realistic fiction, he is widely considered one of the world's greatest novelists.\n\nThis collection includes two translations of each of his great novels, WAR AND PEACE (1869) and ANNA KARENINA (1877).  Also featured are SEBASTOPOL SKETCHES (1855), based on his experiences in the Crimean War, and a large selection of his short stories and novellas, by multiple translators, including &quot;The Death of Ivan Ilyich&quot;, &quot;The Kreutzer Sonata&quot;, &quot;Family Happiness&quot;, and &quot;Hadji Murad&quot;.  The shorter fiction, written over a period of more than half a century, reflect every aspect of Tolstoy's art and personality, covering his experiences as a soldier in the Caucasus, his married life, his passionate interest in the peasantry, his cult of truth and simplicity, and his growing preoccupation with religion.\n\nA CONFESSION (1882) is a brief autobiographical story of the author's struggle with a mid-life existential crisis of melancholia.\n\n\nAll the following books are in ePUB format except CONFESSION:\n\n* ANNA KARENINA (Barnes &amp; Noble, 2003).
