They part ways after sharing a hot meal, and Reacher checks out a quiet town surrounded by countryside serene enough to cool even his raging wanderlust. But not for long. First the trail is suddenly and inexplicably closed. Then the military police show up in force. Maybe itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a drill. Or maybe itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s troubleÃ¢â‚¬â€the kind of trouble that always finds Reacher, no matter how far he travels off the beaten path.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:808eb9155989baba219ae63f89e1114707fcd2ba","amp;dn":"Not+a+Drill+by+Lee+Child+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"808eb9155989baba219ae63f89e1114707fcd2ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,142,185,21,89,137,186,186,33,154,230,63,137,225,17,71,7,252,210,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
