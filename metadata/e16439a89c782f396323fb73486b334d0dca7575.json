Permanent Activation\nQ: It is this permanent?\nA: Until now for Windows 6,7,8,8.1 it will automatic reactivate it often, so yes.\n\n3. Pro WMC/Core\nQ: It only activate for 30 days or 45 days?\nA: It is not posible in real kms activate a ProWMC/Core, but thanks to the emulator is posible activate it for 30 days in W8 and 45 days for W8.1\n\n4. Virus:\nQ:My antivirus alert like crazy!\nA:If you downloaded the file from another location, we dont know what other people do with the file. The file here only has false positives.\n\n5. Online/Offline:\nQ: I need internet connection?\nA: No.\n\n6. TAP Driver\nQ: I noticed Tap-Windows 9.9.2 appear in my programs.

Do this app will broke my license? \nA: The app is designed to check a permanent activation either windows or office and avoid it. Older versions was buggy, but the main idea of this app is be smart and take the right choice without any intervention.\n\n11. Custom Driver\nQ: what is the difference between signed and unsigned driver? \nA: Regular users can use the normal KMSpico install that include a signed TAP-Driver for W8.1 without any problems. Users using another VPN's like OpenVPN will have a conflict and normal install will unistall any previous tap driver, to avoid that I build a custom driver that only work in windows test mode because it is not signed, since i dont have $200 US for sign this custom driver, then it is an unsigned.\n\n\n[center][b][size=150][color=blue]Microsoft Toolkit[/color][/size][/b][/center]\n\nTorrent Downloaded From\n\n\n[center][b][size=200]Installation Steps[/size][/b]\n[/center]\n\n* you need .net Frame work 4.0 or 4.5 to run Microsoft Toolkit 2.4.9.\nyou can download it from here.\n\nFramework 4.5.1[/url]\n\n1.
