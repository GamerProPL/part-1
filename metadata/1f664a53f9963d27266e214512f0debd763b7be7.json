Skateboarders Telly and Casper hang out, shoplift, do drugs and seduce girls. Jennie follows the pair across the city, desperate to confront them with a terrible truth. Written by Harmony Korine (?GUMMO?), ?KIDS? is an unflinching depiction of the beauty and tragedy of youth, a story of a single day in which everything and nothing will change.\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n'If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE'\n\n... simply search for 'freakyflicks' \n*************************************** \n************** FREAKYFLICKS ************* \n***************************************\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f664a53f9963d27266e214512f0debd763b7be7","amp;dn":"Kids+%28Larry+Clark%2C+1995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f664a53f9963d27266e214512f0debd763b7be7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,102,74,83,249,150,61,39,38,110,33,69,18,240,222,189,118,59,123,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
