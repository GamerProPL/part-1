Use your favorite burning program to create your disc. If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have one, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d recommend ImgBurn as simple and easy to use.\n\nIf you want the files on your computer and arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sure how to get them there without burning the DVD first, look up Daemon tools. This can be used to mount the iso file as a virtual drive on your computer, from which you can rip and convert as normal. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6995e4bb15f086cfa7b5f0e1c5eb3dd16c6b2157","amp;dn":"Insanity+disc+3+Cardio+Power+%26amp%3B+Resistance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6995e4bb15f086cfa7b5f0e1c5eb3dd16c6b2157","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,149,228,187,21,240,134,207,167,181,240,225,197,235,61,209,108,107,33,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
