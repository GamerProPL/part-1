Adapted by screenwriter Jonathan Harvey from his own stage play, Beautiful Thing tells how teenage loner Jamie falls for next-door neighbour Ste, one of the tough kids who bullies him at school. Amazingly, he finds his feelings reciprocated, and the two progress to a tender, tentative affair. Sidestepping conventional notions of working-class homophobia, the film succeeds in presenting its central relationship not as anything startlingly different, but simply as a teenage romance--with all the joy and heartbreak it implies--that happens to be between two 15-year-old guys. Problems of brutality and deprivation are acknowledged but never allowed to dominate, and under the influence of love even the harsh walkways and terraces of the estate take on a sunlit glow.\n\nMAKE YOUR OWN KIND OF MUSIC!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:353b009b17aa288203cdc950c8a44f4ea297eca5","amp;dn":"Beautiful+Thing+%281996%29+Gay+Int.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"353b009b17aa288203cdc950c8a44f4ea297eca5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,59,0,155,23,170,40,130,3,205,201,80,200,164,79,78,162,151,236,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
