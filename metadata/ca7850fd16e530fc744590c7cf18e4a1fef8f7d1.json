You'll have a choice of stories to follow and have the opportunity to defend the colony, take control over how the colony is built up, and eliminate the werewolves.

Help!\nA: Google is your friend. This pirated version will CTD for most of the same reasons the bought version will. There are many mods that help prevent CTD.\n\nQ: Is this version Large Address Aware?\nA: Yes I already have applied the Large Address Aware patch (AKA 4gb patch) for you. You should no longer CTD when it needs more than 2gb of memory.\n\nQ: Have you applied the the Morrowind Code Patch or Timeslip's Exe optimization?\nA: No, since you may desire to configure these settings yourself. The only modifications I have applied is a generic CD-check removal and the 4gb LAA patch, which should not conflict with any other patches you may wish to apply.\n\nQ: I can't apply the Morrowind Code Patch on this!\nA: Grab my Morrowind Code Patch kit here:\n\nQ: Will this work with MSGO?\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Is this version moddable?\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: I cannot get mods to work.
