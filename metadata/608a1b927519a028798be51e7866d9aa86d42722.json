This discography consists of all studio albums, EP's, cd singles, 7 inch, and more that I could find. All has the album art included. All cd singles and 7 inch have multiple tracks on each. No bootlegs, real deal stuff. I have spent much time trying to get this put together, went to many different tracker and p2p sites to find it all. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.\n\np.s.... for those of you that are obsessed with perfection(aka OCD)... fair warning to you, not all files are the same kpbs due to the fact that this came from many different sources. NO file is less then 192kbps and most of it is at 256kbps and higher. All of it is MP3 format, if you want it to be something else, convert it yourself.\n\n==========================================\n\nPlease seed for others\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n==========================================\n\n\nStudio albums:\n\nShowbiz\nOrigin of Symmetry\nAbsolution\nBlack Holes &amp; Revelations\n\n\n\nEP's:\n\nMuse\nMuscle Museum\nRandom 1-8\nPlug In Baby\nNew Born\nDead Star/In Your World\n\n\n\nCD singles/7inch:\n\nUno\nSunburn\nUnintended\nBliss\nHyper Music/Feeling Good\nTime Is Running Out\nHysteria\nSing for Absolution\nButterflies and Hurricanes\nSupermassive Black Hole\nStarlight\nKnights of Cydonia\nInvincible\n\n\n\nOther albums:\n\nH.A.A.R.P.
