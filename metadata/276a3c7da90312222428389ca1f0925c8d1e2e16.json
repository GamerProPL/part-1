Please seed at a decent speed.\n\n\n\nI'm Alan Partridge is a BBC situation comedy starring Steve Coogan, of which two series of six episodes each were produced ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the first in 1997 and the second in 2002. The series followed the titular Alan Partridge, a failed television presenter whose previous exploits had featured in the chat-show parody Knowing Me, Knowing You... with Alan Partridge, and who is now presenting a programme on local radio in Norwich.\n\nBoth series were written by Peter Baynham, Coogan and Armando Iannucci; supporting Coogan were Felicity Montagu as his faithful, mouse-like personal assistant, Lynn Benfield; Simon Greenall as Geordie Travel Tavern handyman/BP garage attendant Michael; and Phil Cornwell as disc jockey (DJ) Dave Clifton.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:276a3c7da90312222428389ca1f0925c8d1e2e16","amp;dn":"I%5C%27m+Alan+Partridge+Season+1%2C+2+Complete+%2B+Extras+DVDRip+TSV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"276a3c7da90312222428389ca1f0925c8d1e2e16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,106,60,125,169,3,18,34,36,40,56,156,161,240,146,92,141,30,46,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
