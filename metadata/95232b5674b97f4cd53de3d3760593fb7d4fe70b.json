Jew and American? How can we claim our own identities when our lives are linked so closely to othersâ€™? These are the questions at the heart of Jonathan Safran Foerâ€™s first novel in eleven yearsâ€“a work of extraordinary scope and heartbreaking intimacy.\r\nUnfolding over four tumultuous weeks in present-day Washington D.C., Here I Am is the story of a fracturing family in a moment of crisis. As Jacob and Julia and their three sons are forced to confront the distances between the lives they think they want and the lives they are living, a catastrophic earthquake sets in motion a spiraling conflict in the Middle East. At stake is the very meaning of homeâ€“and the fundamental question of how much life one can bear.\r\nShowcasing the same high-energy inventiveness, hilarious irreverence, and emotional urgency that readers and critics loved in his earlier work, Here I Am is Foerâ€™s most searching, hard-hitting, and grandly entertaining novel yet. It not only confirms Foerâ€™s stature as a dazzling literary talent but reveals a mature novelist who has fully come into his own as one of the most important writers of his generation.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95232b5674b97f4cd53de3d3760593fb7d4fe70b","amp;dn":"Here+I+Am+-+Jonathan+Safran+Foer+%5BEN+EPUB%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95232b5674b97f4cd53de3d3760593fb7d4fe70b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,35,43,86,116,185,127,76,213,61,227,211,118,5,147,251,125,79,231,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
