History went on without him - Russian Premier\n    Romanov signed a historic peace treaty with the Allies and the free\n    world remained free. Now it&amp;#039;s Yuri&amp;#039;s turn to make history, and wreak\n    vengeance on his foes.\n    \n    In hidden bases and underground labs, Yuri has been perfecting his own\n    means for his turn at world domination. Refining his mind-control\n    technologies, he&amp;#039;s created an army of terrors, from mind-controlling\n    tanks to long-range psychics, whose brains are their biggest weapons.\n    After all, a mind is a terrible thing to waste.\n    It&amp;#039;s time for Yuri&amp;#039;s Revenge.\n    \n\n    Game Features:\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    Play as Allies or Soviets, and take on Yuri in Hollywood, Egypt --\n    even the moon - in 14 new solo campaign missions.\n    \n    Put your heads together and take on Yuri as a team in 10 co-op\n    missions split into 4 campaigns.\n    \n    Three new neutral Tech Buildings offer novel ways to beef up your\n    forces.\n    \n    Experiment with new tactics such as mass mind-control, unit-capturing,\n    anti-psychic troops, and power draining.\n    \n    The Red Menace is more menacing than ever with 2 new units and 2 new\n    structures.\n\n    More infos at: http://westwood.ea.com/\n\n        \n    Install Notes:\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    Unrar, burn, install (enter a random serial when asked), copy crack &amp; play.\n    \n    This is an addon to Red Alert 2 - so you need that game of course.\n  \nÃ‚Â· ? ?Ã‚Â·-????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????-Ã‚Â·? ?

You have one or more\n    talents in:\n    \n    - supplying unreleased NEW games (maybe you work at a game/util\n      magazine, newspaper, game press/marketing company, distributor,\n      publisher, duplicator, tv/radio show, warehouse, shop etc.).\n      You do not need a fast internet connection for the above!\n    \n    - supplying unreleased NEW store games &amp; have a fast UPLOAD connection\n      like 200k+, and time to spare on weekday mornings. Of course we\n      shall reimburse you for the costs of the games you buy.\n    \n    - you are a cracker with lots of experience in Cracking/Debugging/ASM\n      &amp; C/C++. You also can code tools to automatically remove commercial\n      protections like SafeDisc 2 or Securom or VOB or Laserlok or\n      Copylok. You will need advanced knowledge of PE File Formats.\n \n    - coding tools in C/C++/ASM (you have HARD CORE in depth knowledge\n      of the Win32-API, you can code by given specifications etc.)\n      And to understand and develope methods like API Hooking.\n    \n    - If you know the difference between reindexing and unpacking\n      large files. Or if you can identify ANY major file formats by\n      looking at the hex byte code of the header. Or if you can tell\n      the difference between MPQ &amp; HAPI.\n      And you have a 30k plus internet download link speed.\n      And can code your own tools to rip apart the above technologies\n      (to show you fully understand them) then apply at once.\n\n    - making trainers for newly released games (menu driven, must work\n      in Win9x and Win2K etc.)\n\n    - coding dynamic/generic intros/installers\n      (send URL links to samples of your previous work.)\n     \n    - supplying the group (for free) with useful things like shells on\n      fast (T3) linux/unix-boxes, hardware etc. Not for spreading \n      releases.\n    \n    If you can meet one or more of those requirements and want to join \n    the finest group in the scene today, email us.
