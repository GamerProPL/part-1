The experience was so exhilarating that Bruce decided to write about\r\nit. Thatâ€™s how this extraordinary autobiography began.\r\nOver the past seven years, Bruce Springsteen has privately devoted himself to\r\nwriting the story of his life, bringing to these pages the same honesty, humor, and\r\noriginality found in his songs.\r\nHe describes growing up Catholic in Freehold, New Jersey, amid the poetry,\r\ndanger, and darkness that fueled his imagination, leading up to the moment he refers\r\nto as â€œThe Big Bangâ€: seeing Elvis Presleyâ€™s debut on The Ed Sullivan Show. He vividly\r\nrecounts his relentless drive to become a musician, his early days as a bar band king in\r\nAsbury Park, and the rise of the E Street Band. With disarming candor, he also tells\r\nfor the first time the story of the personal struggles that inspired his best work, and\r\nshows us why the song â€œBorn to Runâ€ reveals more than we previously realized.\r\nBorn to Run will be revelatory for anyone who has ever enjoyed Bruce Springsteen,\r\nbut this book is much more than a legendary rock starâ€™s memoir. This is a book for\r\nworkers and dreamers, parents and children, lovers and loners, artists, freaks, or\r\nanyone who has ever wanted to be baptized in the holy river of rock and roll.\r\nRarely has a performer told his own story with such force and sweep. Like many of\r\nhis songs (â€œThunder Road,â€ â€œBadlands,â€ â€œDarkness on the Edge of Town,â€ â€œThe\r\nRiver,â€ â€œBorn in the U.S.A,â€ â€œThe Rising,â€ and â€œThe Ghost of Tom Joad,â€ to name\r\njust a few), Bruce Springsteenâ€™s autobiography is written with the lyricism of a singular\r\nsongwriter and the wisdom of a man who has thought deeply about his experiences","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:161c13eff6ea9428475a59a94429a9e973b27912","amp;dn":"Born+to+Run+by+Bruce+Springsteen+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"161c13eff6ea9428475a59a94429a9e973b27912","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,28,19,239,246,234,148,40,71,90,89,169,68,41,169,233,115,178,121,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
