And the skill of strength is no exception. From the ancient days of Greek wrestling, to the jealously guarded secrets of Chinese Kung Fu masters, to the hard men of modern spec ops, warriors and allied strongmen have developed an amazing array of skills for generating inhuman strength.\n\nBut these skills have been scattered far and wide, held closely secret, or communicated in a piecemeal fashion that has left most of us frustrated and far from reaching our true strength potential.\n\nNow, for the first time, Russian strength expert and former Spetsnaz instructor Pavel has gathered many of these devastating techniques into one highly teachable skill set. In The Naked Warrior Pavel reveals exactly what it takes to be super-strong in minimum timeÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶when your body is your only tool.\n\n* Gain more brute strength in days than you did in years of bodybuilding or calisthenics\n* Discover the martial secrets of instant power generationÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶for rapid surges in applied strength\n* Discover how to get a world-class powerlifter's quality workoutÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶using your body only\n* Master the one-arm/one-leg pushup for crushing upper body force\n* Forge super-piston, never-quit legs with the Spetsnaz favorite &quot;Pistol&quot;\n* Discover the magic of &quot;GTG&quot;ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶guaranteed the world's most effective strength routine\n* Be tow-truck strongÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶yet possess the rugged looks of a stripped-down racer\n* Get a harder, firmer, functionally-fitter bodyÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶and be as resilient as hell whatever you face\n* No gym, no weights, no problemÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶get a dynamite strength workout at a moment's noticeÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶wherever you are\n\n&quot;Mr. Tsatsouline has redefined strength-conditioning for the 21st century! Recently retired from 32 years in public education, I used to agonize over the archaic athletic training which I witnessed on a daily basis; Now, Pavel's research can yield a much more condensed, result- producing package.&quot; ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶John McKean, six time All-Round Weightlifting World Champion\n\n&quot;With The Naked Warrior, Pavel has moved the art of exercise without weights to a new level. Now, whether you have weights or not, there is no reason not to get into top shape!&quot; ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶Arthur Drechsler, author &quot;The Weightlifting Encyclopedia&quot;\n\n&quot;The tools Pavel explains in The Naked Warrior will help my Olympic style weight lifters gain the core strength they need to put additional kg on their totals. Thanks Pavel for such a great work!!&quot; ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶Mike Burgener, Sr international weightlifting coach\n\n&quot;For martial artists who don't wish to weight train or just don't have the time The Naked Warrior program is the way to go to enhance strength. You can practice martial skills without the information offered in The Naked Warrior, but you risk not operating at full potential.&quot; ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶George Demetriou, Modern Warrior Defensive Tactics Institute, NYC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abc10bdb244a3797f1ba96b2c9d12d378a1097ec","amp;dn":"Pavel+Tsatsouline+-+The+Naked+Warrior","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abc10bdb244a3797f1ba96b2c9d12d378a1097ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,193,11,219,36,74,55,151,241,186,150,178,201,209,45,55,138,16,151,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
