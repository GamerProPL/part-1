Power requirements lessen. Capabilities compound. Processing speeds skyrocket. Interfacing options multiply. TodayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s microcontrollers and microsized computers greatly surpass those of even just a year ago, making almost any project feasible. And some of the hottest projects right now come from the world of wearables.\n\n\tWhat is a wearable, exactly? Some call the space Ã¢â‚¬Å“wearable electronics,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ others Ã¢â‚¬Å“wearable computing.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ We see it as something far broader than that. Wearable technology can be advanced electronic sensors and displays combined with everyday apparel, like Io FlamentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brainwave-sensing beanie (see page 60) and Jonathan CookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Open-Source Smartwatch (page 54), but it also includes the futuristic under-the-skin projects of a few daring body augmenters (page 53), as well as the mechanical technology in Keahi SeymourÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bionic Boots (page 44).\n\n\tIn this issue of Make: we guide you through these examples and more. But first weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll explain all the latest trends in electronics prototyping boards Ã¢â‚¬â€ including advanced wireless communication protocols Ã¢â‚¬â€ and which boards to keep an eye on. All of them smaller and more powerful than ever. Plus, build a Shishi Odoshi fountain to scare away animals from your garden, make two(!) R/C airplanes that are great for beginning pilots, capture stunning close-up photos with a microscope and a smartphone, and install a climbing wall in your backyard that doubles as a play structure","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fa05e7eb57b59d1e27e7ce1e89b70e00421b7e9","amp;dn":"MAKE+Magazine+-+Vol+43+-+Wires+and+Threads","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fa05e7eb57b59d1e27e7ce1e89b70e00421b7e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,160,94,126,181,123,89,209,226,126,124,225,232,155,112,224,4,33,183,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
