It is the swiss army knife for anyone working with digital audio or \n   synthesizers! \n             \n   Here are just a few examples of common tasks for Awave Studio: \n   --------------------------------------------------------------             \n   Convert different types  of audio files  between more or  less obscure file \n   formats.  \n             \n   Buy a &quot;sample-CD&quot; (or download  instruments) from then net, then  use Awave \n   Studio to convert it  to a format that  your own synth can  read. Besides a \n   vast array of different synth-formats, it also supports MIDI SDS, and  SCSI \n   SMDI transfers. \n             \n   Play MIDI songs that comes  with custom 'instrument banks', or  render them \n   to an  audio clip  (eg. a  MP3) using  the built  in high-quality  software \n   synthesizer. \n             \n   Do audio editing tasks such  as resampling, fading in and  out, normalizing \n   amplitudes, applying effects, and much more. \n             \n   Use it as an  instrument editor for your  synthesizer, sound card, or  soft \n   -synth plug. \n\n   Runs under: Windows 7 / Vista / XP\n\n              Installation:\n\n-  Next open the rar file by double clicking it. If you can't open it you need to get an archiver which supports rar files such as Winrar and extract.\n\n-  Install\n\n        -  That's it. Done. enjoY!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfa73f4ad50bf0c244ae1b764b4463d845514b19","amp;dn":"FMJSoft+Awave+Studio+v10.6+-+AiR+%5Bdeepstatus%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfa73f4ad50bf0c244ae1b764b4463d845514b19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,167,63,74,213,11,240,194,68,174,27,118,75,68,99,216,69,81,75,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
