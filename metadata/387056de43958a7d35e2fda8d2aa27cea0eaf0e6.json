It's not just because she travels the world in an RV with her parents Nigel and Marrianne, famous nature show hosts. Eliza is doubly unique because she was granted the magical ability to talk with and understand animals. Together with her teen-age sister Debbie, her pet chimpanzee Darwin, and her wild-boy foster brother Donnie, Eliza gets involved with many different wildlife (and wild adventures).\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Please SEED! - Thade","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:387056de43958a7d35e2fda8d2aa27cea0eaf0e6","amp;dn":"The+Wild+Thornberrys+-+All+Seasons+%2B+Movies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"387056de43958a7d35e2fda8d2aa27cea0eaf0e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,112,86,222,67,149,138,125,53,226,253,168,210,170,39,206,160,234,240,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
