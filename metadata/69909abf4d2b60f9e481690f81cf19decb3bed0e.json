Tuchman [epub]\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth century reflects two contradictory images: on the one hand, a glittering age of crusades, cathedrals, and chivalry; on the other, a world plunged into chaos and spiritual agony. In this revelatory work, Barbara W. Tuchman examines not only the great rhythms of history but the grain and texture of domestic life: what childhood was like; what marriage meant; how money, taxes, and war dominated the lives of serf, noble, and clergy alike. Granting her subjects their loyalties, treacheries, and guilty passions, Tuchman re-creates the lives of proud cardinals, university scholars, grocers and clerks, saints and mystics, lawyers and mercenaries, and, dominating all, the knightâ€”in all his valor and â€œfurious follies,â€ a â€œterrible worm in an iron cocoon.â€\r\n \r\nâ€œBeautifully written, careful and thorough in its scholarship ... What Ms. Tuchman does superbly is to tell how it was ... No one has ever done this better.â€\r\nâ€” The New York Review of Books\r\n \r\nâ€œA beautiful, extraordinary book ... Tuchman at the top of her powers ... She has done nothing finer.â€\r\nâ€” The Wall Street Journal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69909abf4d2b60f9e481690f81cf19decb3bed0e","amp;dn":"A+Distant+Mirror%3A+The+Calamitous+14th+Century","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69909abf4d2b60f9e481690f81cf19decb3bed0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,144,154,191,77,43,96,249,228,129,105,15,129,207,25,222,203,59,237,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
