Advancing on the overwhelming, big-room theatrics of 2012 LP Ufabulum, Damogen Furies sees Jenkinson take it to the extreme; deploying harsh, exaggerated melodies woven into a perplexingly complex rhythmic tapestry of his trademarked scatter-gun drum breaks and twitchy IDM roots. Any hopes of being eased in gently are quickly abolished with the punishing wallops of opener Ã¢â‚¬ËœStor EiglassÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which are offset against stadium-ready, anthemic synth strings, whereas the darker Ã¢â‚¬ËœBaltang OrtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ retains a more sinister edge with its undercoating of foreboding ambient texture. Ã¢â‚¬ËœRayc Fire 2Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœBaltang ArgÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ explore a more aggressive form; regularly exploding into fits of sonic spasm, yet itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the lush melodic touches and eye-watering breakdowns that prevent the sound from becoming excessive. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re also afforded the odd comic moment, such as the joyously hyped-up melodic ditty that sits in the mid-point of Ã¢â‚¬ËœKontenjazÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, or the glitchy, mind warping aural detonations that underpin Ã¢â‚¬ËœExjag NivesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The menacing Ã¢â‚¬ËœKwang BassÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ brandishes the obligatory razor-sharp 303 line, setting up the gargantuan finale of Ã¢â‚¬ËœD Frozent AacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ which closes another visionary release from an artist intent on continually testing the possibilities of electronic music","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5589bee7bbbdf6667cc5298977c642b760ccaae","amp;dn":"Squarepusher+-+Damogen+Furies+%5B2015%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5589bee7bbbdf6667cc5298977c642b760ccaae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,88,155,238,123,187,223,102,103,204,82,152,151,124,100,43,118,12,202,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
