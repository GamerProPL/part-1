The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. \n\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. \n\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.\n[b]This War of Mine:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tInspired by real-life events \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tControl your survivors and manage your shelter \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCraft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves Ã¢â‚¬â€œ anything that helps you survive \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tMake decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tRandomized world and characters every time you start a new game \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCharcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme\n\nPreviews:\nIGN\nThis War of Mine might be the war game we need.\nGamespot:\nI was intrigued by This War of Mine's attempts to portray the consequences of war in a way that games have largely ignored in the past. The fact that the psychological and emotional challenges of living under such horrifying conditions are something you have to consider as you struggle gives me added hope that it might treat its hefty and important subject matter with the gravity and complexity that it deserves.\n[b]Game Informer[/b]\n11bit is blazing a new thematic trail amidst the currently popular survival genre, and so far the studio seems to have something special on its hand. \n[b]Huge Update v1.3 is Live!:[/b]\nThis is it! The biggest update so far, which has been in development for the last few months, is now available on Steam. We proudly present Update 1.3 that will give you plenty of new stories to tell. Let's take a look at what weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve prepared.\n - Scenario Editor in which you can write your own stories of civilians in war. Pick up members of the group, length of the conflict, weather conditions and more Ã¢â‚¬â€œ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all up to you!\n - Character Editor where you can shape civilians, their look, skills, biographies and then play with them in the game. You can even add your photo and be a part of the story.\n - two new locations: Old Town and Looted Gas Station. Of course they can be included in your scenario! \n- two new music tracks, designed for the night missions! \nIn TWoM you are the narrator. These new tools largely expand your possibilities of telling stories in the game.\n\n\n]Just setup and play. \nby Simple Setup\n\n\nScreenShots","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b149bb0d9fca675685eb0f6d509287c241f15e91","amp;dn":"This+War+of+Mine+1.3+War+Child+Charity+Multi8Installer+%5BSimpleSe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b149bb0d9fca675685eb0f6d509287c241f15e91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,73,187,13,159,202,103,86,133,235,15,109,80,146,135,194,65,241,94,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
