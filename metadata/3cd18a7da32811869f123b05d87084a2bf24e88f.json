The class is designed to run as a hands-on tutorial-style with more than 50% of time being devoted to writing code.\nThe main goal of this course is to set to students on the right path of developing Java web applications on a best-of-breed software stack (Spring and Hibernate) while utilizing time-tested best-practices. While we don't skip on the theory, students focus most of their energy on why they should use a particular technique, and how to best apply it.\n\nThis course is based on Servlets 3.0, JSP 2.2, JSTL 1.2, Spring Framework 3.2, Spring Security 3.1, Hibernate 4.2, and Hibernate Validator 4.3. Additionally, the stack discussed in the class leverages SFL4J 1.7 and LogBack 1.0. All of the code is built with Ant and Maven.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cd18a7da32811869f123b05d87084a2bf24e88f","amp;dn":"Marakana+-+Java+Web+Development+with+Spring+and+Hibernate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cd18a7da32811869f123b05d87084a2bf24e88f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,209,138,125,163,40,17,134,159,18,59,5,216,112,132,162,191,36,232,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
