Sophisticated tools for professional songwriting, editing, and mixing are built around a modern interface thatÃ­s designed to get creative results quickly and also deliver more power whenever itÃ­s needed. Logic Pro X includes a massive collection of instruments, effects, and loops, providing a complete toolkit to create amazing-sounding music.\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n\r\nNew Features/Enhancements\r\n\r\nLogic now offers a new preference pane (Control Surfaces &gt; MIDI Controllers) that allows the automatic assignment of controls for supported USB MIDI control devices to be enabled and disabled.\r\n\r\nStability/Reliability\r\n\r\nIncludes several improvements to Logicâ€™s stability, including, but not limited to:\r\n\r\nLogic no longer sometimes quits unexpectedly when: \r\n\r\nAt startup there are aliases in the path to the Alchemy database or presets, or if the Alchemy database has been set to Read-only.\r\nDisplaying a content download progress bar.\r\nOpening a Channel EQ plug-in window from Logic Remote.\r\nA project containing an open Score text box is closed.\r\nOpening the Audio File Editor with a key command when running in Japanese.\r\nOpening the Plug-in Manger if there is a custom display name for a plug-in that contains more than 2 spaces.\r\nGrouping files in the Audio Bin.\r\nOption-dragging a folder stack.\r\n\r\nLogic no longer sometimes stops responding when: \r\n\r\nCanceling a download while previewing an Apple Loop in the Loop Browser\r\nUsing VoiceOver to interact with the Mixer\r\nClicking on the Library tab with a software instrument track selected and an instance of Melodyne 4 inserted on an audio track\r\n\r\nEditing\r\n\r\nRubber band selection of MIDI Draw data in the Piano Roll now works correctly when the selection is started outside the boundaries of the region.\r\nDragging is now restricted to the vertical direction when pressing Control + Shift while dragging a note in the Flex Pitch editor to move it more than one semitone.\r\n\r\nAutomation\r\n\r\nAutomation of Stereo Delay and Tape Delay created in Logic Pro X 10.2 or older now plays back correctly in Logic Pro X 10.2.2 or later.\r\n\r\nMixer\r\n\r\nCreating tracks from the Mixer no longer unexpectedly changes their output setting.\r\n\r\nPlug-ins\r\n\r\nThe display for IR waveforms in Space Designer now updates immediately when loading a preset or reversing an IR.\r\nUser added Space Designer impulse responses copied from one computer to another are now reliably found on the destination computer.\r\nLogic again can open instances of Altiverb 7.1 or earlier.\r\n\r\nScore\r\n\r\nIt is again possible to use strike-through text in the Score editor.\r\n\r\nMovies\r\n\r\nAudio from an open movie no longer mutes unexpectedly when the playhead is touched.\r\nRight or Control-clicking a movie window again opens a contextual menu as expected.\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n\r\nMIDI input now works with Roland A49 and A88 USB keyboards.\r\nPlayback in Cycle mode now remains in sync when using latency causing plug-ins.\r\nPlaying MIDI data into Logic after stopping no longer clears data from the Capture Last Recording buffer.\r\nThe Orchestral and Music for Picture project templates are again available when the Orchestral content is installed.\r\nAudio recordings made by punching in and out in Cycle mode with the Create Track preference set for overlapping recordings are now reliably in sync.\r\nAll key commands are now functioning as expected while Logic downloads additional content.\r\nMoving one or more regions and then performing undo no longer causes them to be unselected.\r\nThe Follow Tempo check box is again available in the region inspector after detecting the tempo of the region.\r\nIt is again possible to load tempo information stored in an audio file into the Logic project.\r\nThe Playhead again scrolls smoothly when zoomed out on large projects.\r\nStrip Silence again delivers consistent results when reapplied with the same settings.\r\nAll menus now open reliably on computers running OS X 10.9.5.\r\nIt is again possible to move a region on a software instrument track that is adjacent to a track stack to a different position along the time line without the region being inadvertently moved into the track stack.\r\nDragging the left edge of an audio region with Snap to Zero Crossing enabled no longer sometimes causes the waveform display to make it look as though the region content has shifted.\r\nIn region solo mode, all sends now sound as expected when selecting regions on different tracks.\r\nClicking in the Timeline now correctly positions the Playhead when Skip Cycle is enabled.\r\nIt is again possible to type in a value higher than +6db in the Region Gain parameter.\r\nStopping playback with the Transport no longer unexpectedly re-enables Catch Playhead Position when it has been disabled in the Toolbar.\r\nAfter deleting a take when recording to a group of audio channels, Logic no longer sometimes disarms recording for all but the selected track and shows an incorrect â€œMultiple channels of this recording group have identical input settingâ€.\r\nAudio input monitoring now works with Varispeed active when the Multithreading preference Playback &amp; Live Tracks is activated.\r\nWhen opened with an empty audio track, the Audio Track Editor no longer opens near its maximum zoom level.\r\nThe Playhead now cycles correctly when the Audio &gt; Devices &gt; Multithreading preference is set to Playback Tracks.\r\nThe Scroll to Selection key command again works during playback.\r\nThe 2/3 option for Detect Tempo now works as expected.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDo not make money with this software...\r\n\r\nRemember to BUY the stuff if you USE it.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nfuture-dada\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\ndemonoid.pw\r\n1337x.to\r\nthepiratebay.se\r\nflashtorrents.org\r\nbtscene.cc\r\ntorrent-core.org\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMMXVI (03)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46c3c6e062123e32b6fe317fd4d04b765cec303f","amp;dn":"Logic+Pro+X+10.2.2+OS+X+%5BMAS%5D%5BTNT%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46c3c6e062123e32b6fe317fd4d04b765cec303f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,195,198,224,98,18,62,50,182,254,49,127,212,208,75,118,92,236,48,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
