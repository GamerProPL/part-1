Fixed, and debugged\n\n\n19-year old man died in USA from heart attack, while he was playing this game.\n\nParsec Production/Blue Isle Studios\n2013\nPC\n4.1.0.67110\n\n\nWindows XP, Vista, Windows 7\nIntel Core 2 Duo 2200 MHz\n2 Gb RAM\nGeForce GT400 \n1500 Mb\n\nThe majority of the game takes place in abandoned areas (house, defunct mine, etc.), each with different objectives. Slender: The Arrival uses similar mechanics to its predecessor, The Eight Pages. The character is armed only with a flashlight. This limited defense forces a sense of helplessness, as the best way to survive in the game is to run whenever in danger.\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ef5f415e3840b9df769ebc46b98ae05aa34535d","amp;dn":"Slender%3A+The+Arrival+v+1.5.2+%282013%29+PC+ENG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ef5f415e3840b9df769ebc46b98ae05aa34535d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,245,244,21,227,132,11,157,247,105,235,196,107,152,174,5,170,52,83,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
