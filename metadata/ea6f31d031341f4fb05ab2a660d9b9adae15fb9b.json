Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.\r\n\r\nIt has been centuries since the fall of the 10 consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Wars were fought for them, and won by them. One such war rages on the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where 10 armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.\r\n\r\nBrightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.\r\n\r\nAcross the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.\r\n\r\nDirector Rose Supan says, â€œBrandon Sanderson is at the top of his game with THE STORMLIGHT ARCHIVES. It's an honor to direct this story. The actors as well as our production team are thrilled to be a part of the process as well. I can proudly proclaim that the listener is in for a truly immersive experience!â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProduced by Graphic Audio\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nRelease Date: Apr 11, 2016\r\nApproximate Running Time: 7 Hours\r\nNumber of CDs: 7\r\nISBN # 978-1-62851-247-2\r\nContent Rating: Ages 13+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea6f31d031341f4fb05ab2a660d9b9adae15fb9b","amp;dn":"Brandon+Sanderson+-+The+Way+of+Kings+%28The+Stormlight+Archive+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea6f31d031341f4fb05ab2a660d9b9adae15fb9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,111,49,208,49,52,31,79,176,90,178,166,96,217,185,173,174,21,251,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
