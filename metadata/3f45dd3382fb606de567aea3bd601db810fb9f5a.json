The album--a set of 10 concise, country-based songs--marks a deliberate turn towards simplicity after the band's wildly ambitious and widely acclaimed 2009 song-cycle The Hazards of Love. Produced once again by Tucker Martine, The King Is Dead features special guest appearances by Americana luminary Gillian Welch on seven tracks and legendary R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck on three tracks. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f45dd3382fb606de567aea3bd601db810fb9f5a","amp;dn":"The+Decemberists+-+The+King+Is+Dead+%5Bmp3-320-2011%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f45dd3382fb606de567aea3bd601db810fb9f5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,69,221,51,130,251,96,109,229,103,174,163,189,96,29,184,16,251,159,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
