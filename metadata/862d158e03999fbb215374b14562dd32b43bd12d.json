It was released on 22 February 1986, and it was remastered and re-issued on 22 August 1995. It marks the final appearance of lead guitarist Jake E. Lee with Osbourne.\n\nThe album was awarded Platinum status in May 1986 and was awarded Double Platinum status in October 1994\n   The Ultimate Sin is the first and only Osbourne album to feature bassist Phil Soussan, who co-wrote the album's U.S. hit single &quot;Shot in the Dark&quot;. Drummer Randy Castillo, who had previously played in Lita Ford's band, also makes his recording debut with Osbourne.\n\nUpon returning from the Betty Ford Center in 1985 where he had undergone treatment for substance abuse, Osbourne was presented with a substantial quantity of music written by guitarist Lee. \nAfter having been cheated out of his writing and publishing claims for Osbourne's previous album, 1983's Bark At The Moon, Lee says this time he refused to contribute anything until he had a contract in front of him guaranteeing his writing credit and publishing rights. \nMuch of this music would form the basis of the album. \nThe album's lyrics were largely written by long-time Osbourne bassist and lyricist Bob Daisley. \nDaisley left the band prior to recording after having a disagreement with Osbourne, prompting the hiring of Soussan as his replacement. Daisley was not credited for his songwriting contributions on the initial 1986 pressing of the album, though this was corrected on subsequent pressings.\n\nDespite its initial success, The Ultimate Sin has since been deleted from Osbourne's catalogue and was not reissued or remastered along with the rest of Osbourne's albums in 2002 (same for Just Say Ozzy and Live &amp; Loud). \nThe only available CD version of The Ultimate Sin is the 1995 remasters version. The original version of the album is still freely available in Australia as a budget-priced CD.\n\nTracklist`\n\n    Crazy Train\n    Steal Away (The Night)\n    Mr. Crowley\n    Goodbye To Romance\n    Over The Mountain\n    Flying High Again\n    Little Dolls\n    Tonight\n    Bark At The Moon\n    Slow Down\n    Waiting For Darkness\n    You're No Different\n    The Ultimate Sin\n    Fool Like You\n    Shot In The Dark\n    Killer Of Giants\n    Devil's Daughter\n    Breaking All The Rules\n    Crazy Babies\n    Demon Alcohol\n    Desire\n    Mr. Tinkertrain\n    No More Tears\n    Mama I'm Coming Home\n    Perry Mason\n    Thunder Underground\n    I Just Want You\n    Denial\n    Alive\n    Can You Hear Them\n    Facing Hell\n    Dreamer\n    Fearless\n    Let Me Hear You Scream\n    Crucify\n    Time\n    Paranoid (Live)\n    No Bone Movies (Live)\n    Children Of The Grave (Live)\n    Changes (Live)\n  \n\n    Personnel\n\n    Ozzy Osbourne Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals\n    Jake E.
