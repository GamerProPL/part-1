Pipes and Dr. Lawrence R. Harvill\nDover Publications | June 2014 | ISBN-10: 0486779513 | ePUB | 538 pages | 36.8 mb\n\nOne of the most widely used reference books on applied mathematics for a generation, distributed in multiple languages throughout the world, this text is geared toward use with a one-year advanced course in applied mathematics for engineering students. The treatment assumes a solid background in the theory of complex variables and a familiarity with complex numbers, but it includes a brief review. Chapters are as self-contained as possible, offering instructors flexibility in designing their own courses.\nThe first eight chapters explore the analysis of lumped parameter systems. Succeeding topics include distributed parameter systems and important areas of applied mathematics. Each chapter features extensive references for further study as well as challenging problem sets. Answers and hints to select problem sets are included in an Appendix. This edition includes a new Preface by Dr. Lawrence R. Harvill.\n\nAbout the Authors\nLouis A. Pipes (1910Ã¢â‚¬â€œ71) joined the faculty of UCLA in 1947 and remained there for the rest of his life. Previously, he taught for eight years at Harvard and for one year at the Rice Institute. This, his first book, was translated into many languages and since 1970 has ranked among the most widely used references on the subject.\nLawrence R. Harvill is Professor Emeritus of Engineering Science at the University of Redlands in California.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10e81d7aae64c4a2a9766f2e5bf813dd50066889","amp;dn":"Applied+Mathematics+for+Engineers+and+Physicists+%283rd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10e81d7aae64c4a2a9766f2e5bf813dd50066889","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,232,29,122,174,100,196,162,169,118,111,46,91,248,19,221,80,6,104,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
