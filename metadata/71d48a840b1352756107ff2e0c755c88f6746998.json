Well! F*(k Yeah!\r\n\r\nVideo was good but has issues as always with cam videos, fixed the best i can. i did not touch rotation whats the point of losing more pic. fix colors, bright, contrast, and ran through some custom stuff which i don't wanna tell you, came out sweet.\r\n\r\nAudio on other hand was not perfect which i had for days. it has some issues as well. at 27mins to 34min mark audio is not digital i replace that with cam audio there was no choice as original audio was full of distortion. at near end there is 1min audio which i again replaced with cam audio. rest is line. ran through some cleaning stuff to bring the noise down and then mastered it for other parts. Syncing was dam hard took my lot of time nearly 2 days since i am very very lazy person but end results are satisfying.\r\n\r\nIt definitely a BIG Poop improvement over audio and video.\r\n\r\nEnjoy The Fine CPG RELEASE... wont get better then that unless new source which i don't think anyone has balls to do it. Enjoy 2 Samples included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71d48a840b1352756107ff2e0c755c88f6746998","amp;dn":"Jason+Bourne+2016+HD-TS+x264-CPG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71d48a840b1352756107ff2e0c755c88f6746998","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,212,138,132,11,19,82,117,97,7,255,46,12,117,92,136,246,116,105,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
