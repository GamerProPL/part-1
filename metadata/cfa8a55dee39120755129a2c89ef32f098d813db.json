Steven D. Katz walks his readers through the various stages of moviemaking, advising them at every turn to visualize the films they wish to produce. Katz believes that one of the chief tasks of filmmaking is to negotiate between our three-dimensional reality and the two-dimensionality of the screen. He covers the number of technical options filmmakers can use to create a satisfying flow of shots, a continuity that will make sense to viewers and aptly tell the film's story. Katz provides in-depth coverage of production design, storyboarding, spatial connections, editing, scene staging, depth of frame, camera angles, point of view, and the various types of stable compositions and moving camera shots.\nReview\n&quot;Now that you've got a couple of shorts under your belt, why not get a little more analytic? Steven Katz's book gives a great breakdown of the fundamentals of film directing. It's not something you might want to start off by reading, but once you are ready to have your films take that next step this should be number one on your to do list. Katz breaks down film language for you so that you can learn how to speak it in your own way.&quot; - www.austinfilmfestival.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfa8a55dee39120755129a2c89ef32f098d813db","amp;dn":"Film+Directing+Shot+by+Shot+-+Steven+D.+Katz.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfa8a55dee39120755129a2c89ef32f098d813db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,168,165,93,238,57,18,7,85,18,154,44,137,239,50,240,152,216,19,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
