Almost 20 minutes of hyped up,straight to the point, simple (though luscious) and hard bangers, which wears its strong hip-hop influences on its sleeves. These 5 tracks could easily set alight underground dancefloors as well as soundtrack the largest commercial rap and R'n'B stars on the planet.\n\nQuality: MP3 VBR -V0 (259-282 kbps) \n\nTrack Listing:\n1. Top Floor                         1:53\n\n2. Goooo                             3:21\n\n3. Higher Ground                     3:19\n\n4. Bugg'n                            3:25\n\n5. Easy Easy                         3:51\n\n\nDon't forget to seed, and if you enjoyed, please support the artist by buying the EP here: https://bleep.com/release/36459\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea69367bd0f116e1c66661646554453c0cac981a","amp;dn":"TNGHT%3A+TNGHT+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea69367bd0f116e1c66661646554453c0cac981a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,105,54,123,208,241,22,225,198,102,97,100,101,84,69,60,12,172,152,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
