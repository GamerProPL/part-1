Rosi spent months living on the Mediterranean island, capturing its history, culture and the current everyday reality of its 6,000-strong local population as hundreds of migrants land on its shores on a weekly basis. The resulting documentary focuses on 12-year-old Samuele, a local boy who loves to hunt with his slingshot and spend time on land even though he hails from a culture steeped in the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguages: Italian / English\r\n\r\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / French","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea21f26b39898e71a26fa8cb104962de89a3800f","amp;dn":"Fuocoammare+aka+Fire+at+Sea+2016+BRRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea21f26b39898e71a26fa8cb104962de89a3800f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,33,242,107,57,137,142,113,162,111,168,203,16,73,98,222,137,163,128,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
