Since our inception in March of 2001 we have been\n         catering to the needs of DivX &amp; XviD enthusiasts everywhere\n         by releasing high-quality DVDRips of the finest films and \n         television shows from around the world.\n\n         We also strive to keep on the cutting edge of new developments \n         in the MPEG-4 scene and applying them within the constraints of\n         the existing scene rules. Our XviD settings are chosen in an \n         attempt to create the best compromise between quality and \n         compatibility. In pursuit of that goal, we have decided at that\n         this time we will avoid the use of QPel and GMC. As well, when \n         using Custom Mpeg Quantization matrices, we will try to make\n         sure that such matrices will be compatible with as many decoders \n         as possible. We are also now using Packed Bitstream in our\n         encodes.  With the development of MPEG4Modifier, it is now a \n         simple matter to remove the packed bitstream for those whom PB \n         causes a playback issue. Please make sure to unpack the bitstream \n         and remove the DivX999b000p UserData. Please make sure to update \n         your own decoders if any trouble arises.\n\n         We are currently looking for 100Mbit+ Classic DivX/XviD sites\n         in Europe and Asia for affiliation.\n\n                                                      \n                                              \n                               \n                            \n                                              \n                              \n                                    \n                                     \n                         \n                           \n                          \n                                     \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                            OUR GREETiNGS        \n                                             \n                                          \n                                             \n\n                   MDX + QiX + DVD-R + iNSPiRE + SAC + MSR\n\n                              SPECiAL THANKS TO:\n\n                          All our fans &amp; supporters\n\n                                       \n                                           \n                           \n                           \n                             [09/15]\n                                 \n\n                    SChiZO: Corrupting Young Minds in 2004","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80d13516a511b0c0feadfdeeb0fdeb32c9a72d57","amp;dn":"James.and.the.Giant.Peach.1996.INTERNAL.DVDRip.XviD-SChiZO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80d13516a511b0c0feadfdeeb0fdeb32c9a72d57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,209,53,22,165,17,176,192,254,173,253,238,176,253,235,50,201,167,45,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
