Author Paul F. Aubin covers creating 3D views; modeling wall layers, sweeps, and custom components; applying materials and custom textures to objects; and rendering the final scene with optimal quality settings. The course also shows how to create a walk-through that showcases designs.\nTopics include:\nUnderstanding camera view settings\nDeveloping approaches to modeling\nConstructing wall profiles\nCreating materials and textures\nSharing materials between files\nWorking with Sun Path\nLighting a scene with lighting fixture families and lighting groups\nUnderstanding the rendering process\nApplying background settings\nGenerating rendered output\nExperimenting with non-photorealistic render types","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9496dfb737d25fe1812dc065b4b5e58f5c551fc5","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Revit+Architecture%3A+Rendering+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9496dfb737d25fe1812dc065b4b5e58f5c551fc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,150,223,183,55,210,95,225,129,45,192,101,180,181,229,143,92,85,31,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
