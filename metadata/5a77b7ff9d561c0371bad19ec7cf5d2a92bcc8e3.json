A pious Catholic engineer in his early thirties, he lives by a strict moral code in order to rationalize his world, drowning himself in mathematics and the philosophy of Pascal. After spotting the delicate, blonde FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§oise at Mass, he vows to make her his wife, although when he unwittingly spends the night at the apartment of the bold, brunette divorcÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Maud, his rigid ethical standards are challenged. A breakout hit in the United States, My Night at MaudÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s was one of the most influential and talked-about films of the decade.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/268/vlcsnap234943sg1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/268/vlcsnap234943sg1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/2406/vlcsnap234997zt5.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/2406/vlcsnap234997zt5.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/115/vlcsnap235089un4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/115/vlcsnap235089un4.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSpecial Features\n** New, restored high-definition digital transfer, supervised and approved by director Eric Rohmer\n** &quot;On Pascal,&quot; (1965), directed by Rohmer for the educational TV series En profil dans le texte\n** A 1974 episode of the French television program TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ma, featuring interviews with star Jean-Louis Trintignant, film critic Jean Douchet, and producer Pierre Cottrell\n** Original theatrical trailer\n** New and improved English subtitle translation\n\n\n\n-------not my rip---------\n\nFile Name: Ma nuit chez Maud.avi\nFile Size (in bytes): 1,468,561,408\n\n--- Container Information ---\nBase Type (e.g &quot;AVI&quot; ): AVI(.AVI)\nSubtype (e.g &quot;OpenDML&quot;): OpenDML (AVI v2.0),\nInterleave (in ms): 96\nPreload (in ms): 96\nAudio alignment(&quot;split across interleaves&quot; ): Split\nNumber of Audio Streams: 1\n\n--- Video Information ---\nVideo Codec Type(e.g. &quot;DIV3&quot; ): xvid\nDuration (hh:mm:ss ): 01:50:32\nFrame Count: 159022\nFrame Width (pixels): 624\nFrame Height (pixels): 464\nFrame Aspect Ratio (e.g &quot;1.3333&quot; ): 1.3333\nDisplay Aspect Ratio (&quot;DAR&quot; ): 1.345\nFrames Per Second: 23967023\nVideo Bitrate (kbps): 1735\nMPEG-4 (&quot;MPEG-4&quot; or &quot;&quot; ): MPEG-4\n\n--- Audio Information ---\nAudio Codec (e.g. &quot;AC3&quot;): 0x2000(AC3, Dolby Laboratories, Inc) AC3\nAudio Codec Status (e.g. &quot;Codec Is Installed&quot; ): Codec(s) are Installed\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz): 48000\nAudio Bitrate(kbps): 32\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot; ): CBR\nAudio Channel Count (e.g. &quot;2&quot; for stereo): 2 \n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
