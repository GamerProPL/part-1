How do you move the valuable applications and data to a new system or hardware after disaster strikes? How do you quickly restore a system after the hardware has changed?\n\nAcronis solves these common issues with Acronis Universal Restore, a fully integrated module that restores servers or workstations to different hardware or to a virtual machine, providing highly flexible disaster recovery and migration options.\n\nThe Acronis Universal Restore module prepares you for unforeseen events without requiring administrators to purchase and maintain identical spare machines.\n\nThe process begins when a platform agent is used to create a transportable image that disassociates the data from the old machineÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s underlying hardware. Acronis Universal Restore loads in the new hardwareÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own drivers so that the image from the previous hardware platform will allow the machine to be flawlessly restored to a different hardware platform, complete with operating system, applications, data and all previous settings. Recovery can be implemented to an existing system, to a new system with different hardware, or to a virtual machine, in minutes, by following these steps:\n\n* Boot your replacement system with Acronis Backup &amp; Recovery 11.5 bootable media you have created and select Ã¢â‚¬ËœRecoveryÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in the menu.\n* Select the image to restore.\n* Acronis Universal Restore then initiates the restore process, detects the hardware and installs the appropriate drivers for Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL).\n* The result is a perfectly functioning system on a new hardware platform.\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nOperating Systems: Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP Professional SP2+, Windows 2000 Professional\n\nPlatforms: x86 (32 bit), x64 (64 bit)\n\nBoot methods: BIOS, UEFI\n\nFile Systems: FAT16/32, NTFS\n\nLanguage : English\n\nHomepage - 1 :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.acronis.eu/backup-recovery/smallbusiness.html#overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.acronis.eu/backup-recovery/smallbusiness.html#overview&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHomepage - 2 :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.acronis.eu/backup-recovery/smallbusiness.html#add-ons-universal-restore&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.acronis.eu/backup-recovery/smallbusiness.html#add-ons-universal-restore&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90e572b65b44fb5772655d15eac3b99fa261901d","amp;dn":"Acronis+Backup-Recovery+11.5.37975+Workstation++Server+with+Univ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90e572b65b44fb5772655d15eac3b99fa261901d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,229,114,182,91,68,251,87,114,101,93,21,234,195,185,159,162,97,144,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
