Currently, Lua is being used in areas ranging from embedded systems to Web development and is widely spread in the game industry, where knowledge of Lua is an indisputable asset. Lua also has established itself as a major language in software development for mobile devices. Programming in Lua is the official book about the language, giving a solid base for any programmer who wants to use Lua. Authored by Roberto Ierusalimschy, the chief architect of the language, it covers all aspects of Lua 5---from the basics to its API with C---explaining how to make good use of its features and giving numerous code examples. Programming in Lua is targeted at people with some programming background, but does not assume any prior knowledge about Lua or other scripting languages. This Third Edition updates the text to Lua 5.2 and brings substantial new material. In particular, it brings more than one hundred exercises distributed through all chapters, ranging from simple questions about the language to full small-size projects.\n\nProduct Details\nAmazon Sales Rank: #33277 in Books\nBrand: Brand: Lua.org\nPublished on: 2013-01-03\nOriginal language: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21ba9e76bdee160ca3e035a87a7437c7fd8dfa8a","amp;dn":"Programming+in+Lua+%28Third+Edition%29+%5B+PDF+Epub+mobi+%5D+%7BAlso+mac+o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21ba9e76bdee160ca3e035a87a7437c7fd8dfa8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,186,158,118,189,238,22,12,163,224,53,168,122,116,55,199,253,141,250,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
