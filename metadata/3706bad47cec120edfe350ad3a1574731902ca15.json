Itâ€™s as much a pat on the back as a slap in the face. Itâ€™s the first truly no BS guide to flourishing in a crazy, crazy world.\r\n\r\nIf you havenâ€™t already read the internet-famous article, then start with that. But the book is so much more.\r\n\r\nEssentially, the book presents an entirely new approach to personal development, from top to bottom. Life is not about getting rid of problems, itâ€™s about finding better problems. Itâ€™s not about avoiding failure, itâ€™s about getting better at failure. Itâ€™s not about knowing everything, but becoming more comfortable in not knowing anything.\r\n\r\nThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is all about coming to terms with all of the inevitable unimportant imperfections in life and then choosing to not give a f*ck about them. Itâ€™s about learning how to give a f*ck about the few things that truly matter.\r\n\r\nVisit http://markmanson.net","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3706bad47cec120edfe350ad3a1574731902ca15","amp;dn":"The+Subtle+Art+of+Not+Giving+a+F+ck+-+Mark+Manson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3706bad47cec120edfe350ad3a1574731902ca15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,6,186,212,124,236,18,14,223,227,80,173,58,21,116,115,25,2,202,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
