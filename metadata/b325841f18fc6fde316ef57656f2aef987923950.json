Published 10 times a year, it was founded in 1970 by Ira Davidson Sabin (born 1928) as a newsletter called Radio Free Jazz. Sabine founded Radio Free Jazz to complement his Washington, D.C. record store that he founded in 1962.[1] As a newsletter, it informed consumers of the latest jazz releases and provided jazz broadcasters with news and backstories related to playlists.\r\n\r\nAfter a decade of growth in subscriptions, deepening of writer pools, and internationalization, Radio Free Jazz expanded its focus and, at the suggestion of jazz critic Leonard Feather, changed its name to JazzTimes in 1980.[2] One of Ira Sabin's two sons, Glenn, joined the magazine staff in 1984. In 1990, JazzTimes created a new look that incorporated exclusive cover photography and higher quality art and graphic design. Its coverage includes reviews of audio and video releases, concerts, instruments, music supplies, and books. It also features a guide to artists, events, record labels, and music schools. JazzTimes and Down Beat are the two largest print publications devoted exclusively to jazz in North America.\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/shtihl22\r\n\r\n=======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b325841f18fc6fde316ef57656f2aef987923950","amp;dn":"Jazz+Times+-+October+2016+-+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b325841f18fc6fde316ef57656f2aef987923950","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,37,132,31,24,252,111,222,49,110,245,118,86,242,174,249,135,146,57,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
