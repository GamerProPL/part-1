The band was formed in 2002 and their first EP, VÃƒÂªn, was released in 2003. VÃƒÂªn was a studio project of Glanzmann's, but its success led to the recruitment of a full band. They describe themselves as &quot;The new wave of folk metal&quot;. The band then released a full-length album, Spirit, in June 2006. In November 2007, Eluveitie was signed by Nuclear Blast. The first product of the collaboration, Slania, was released in February 2008. The album peaked at number 35 in the Swiss charts and number 72 in the German charts.\n\nEluveitie use traditional instruments amidst guitars and harsh vocals. The lyrics are often in the extinct ancient language Gaulish. The name of the band comes from graffiti on a vessel from Mantua (ca. 300 BC).[10] The inscription in Etruscan letters reads eluveitie, which has been interpreted as the Etruscan form of the Celtic (h)elvetios (Ã¢â‚¬Å“the HelvetianÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), presumably referring to a man of Helvetian descent living in Mantua.                                           \nTracklist:\n01 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Origins (Intro)\n02 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Nameless\n03 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ From Darkness\n04 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Celtos\n05 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Virunus\n06 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Nothing (Intermezzo)\n07 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Call of the Mountains\n08 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sucellos\n09 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Inception\n10 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Vianna\n11 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Silver Sister\n12 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ King\n13 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Day of Strife\n14 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ogmios (Intermezzo)\n15 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Carry the Torch\n16 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Eternity (Outro)\nI ran a 192k now its 320k enjoy and seed.
