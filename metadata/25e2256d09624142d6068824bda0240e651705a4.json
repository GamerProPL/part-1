In his world, where television rules and literature is on the brink of extinction, firemen start fires rather than put them out. His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden.\n\nMontag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television &quot;family.&quot; But then he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn't live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television.\n\nWhen Mildred attempts suicide and Clarisse suddenly disappears, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known. He starts hiding books in his home, and when his pilfering is discovered, the fireman has to run for his life.\n\nFirst published in 1953, Fahrenheit 451 is a classic novel set in the future when books forbidden by a totalitarian regime are burned. The hero, a book burner, suddenly discovers that books are flesh and blood ideas that cry out silently when put to the torch. \n\n--------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy, and PLEASE SEED.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25e2256d09624142d6068824bda0240e651705a4","amp;dn":"Fahrenheit+451+-+Ray+Bradbury+-+eBook+%5BEPUB%2C+MOBI%2C+RTF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25e2256d09624142d6068824bda0240e651705a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,226,37,109,9,98,65,66,214,6,136,36,189,160,36,14,101,23,5,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
