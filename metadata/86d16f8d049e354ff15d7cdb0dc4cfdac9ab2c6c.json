In addition to the usual concert staples, Springsteen and the E Street Band spotlighted several songs from The River that would rarely be played on subsequent tours. Shortly before midnight, Springsteen killed a bit of time with a cover of Wilson PickettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“In the Midnight Hour,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which was followed by Ã¢â‚¬Å“Auld Lang Syne.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nNassau Night had also gained fame among Springsteen bootleg collectors as the longest show in his history. Not including the intermission, the New YearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Eve concert runs three hours and 47 minutes. That record stood until 2012, when he closed out his European tour by playing four hours and six minutes Ã¢â‚¬â€ without leaving the stage Ã¢â‚¬â€ in Helsinki, Finland. Other highlights include E Street Band keyboardist Roy Bittan playing a snippet of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Once Upon A Time in the WestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as an intro the first-pumping Ã¢â‚¬Å“BadlandsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the crowd-pleasing Ã¢â‚¬Å“RosalitaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to close out the main set of the 38-song concert","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86d16f8d049e354ff15d7cdb0dc4cfdac9ab2c6c","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+-+Live+Nassau+Coliseum+1980+%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86d16f8d049e354ff15d7cdb0dc4cfdac9ab2c6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,209,111,141,4,158,53,79,241,93,124,219,13,196,207,218,201,171,44,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
