The book, released in 1985, covers a variety of instances in Feynman's life. Some are lighthearted in tone, such as his fascination with safe-cracking, fondness for topless bars, and ventures into art and samba music. Others cover more serious material, including his work on the Manhattan Project (during which his first wife Arline Greenbaum died of tuberculosis) and his critique of the science education system in Brazil.\n\nThe anecdotes were edited from taped conversations that Feynman had with his close friend and drumming partner Ralph Leighton. Its surprise success led to a sequel entitled What Do You Care What Other People Think?, also taken from Leighton's taped conversations. Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! sold more than 500,000 copies.[citation needed]\n\nThe title derives from a woman's response at Princeton University when, after she asked the newly-arrived Feynman if he wanted cream or lemon in his tea, he requested both (not knowing that they would curdle).\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c4030f06901551724e88f0adfa49fc418763aed","amp;dn":"Audio+Book+%3A+Richard+Feynman+-+Surely+Youre+Jokeing+Mr.+Feynman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c4030f06901551724e88f0adfa49fc418763aed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,64,48,240,105,1,85,23,36,232,143,10,223,164,159,196,24,118,58,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
