An extensive collection of file system tools are also included, as Parted Magic supports the following: btrfs, ext2, ext3, ext4, fat16, fat32, hfs, hfs+, jfs, linux-swap, ntfs, reiserfs, and xfs. PartedMagic requires at least a 586 processor with 1GB of RAM. 512MB in Live mode. Compatible with Secure Boot Windows 8 machines. Runs well on Intel Macs.\n\nFeatures\n    Format internal and external hard drives.\n    Move, copy, create, delete, expand &amp; shrink hard drive partitions.\n    Clone your hard drive, to create a full backup.\n    Test hard drives for impending failure.\n    Test memory for bad sectors.\n    Benchmark your computer for a performance rating.\n    Securely erase your entire hard drive, wiping it clean from all data.\n    Gives access to non-booting systems allowing you to rescue important data.\n    Runs from the CD, no install required.\n\nWe reorganized the iso and removed a little over 40MB from the download without removing any features. We actually added a lot of stuff.\n\nIn the past a few people were getting hung up on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Setting up system devicesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. We figured out what was going on. They had DVD drives hooked to ASMedia Sata3 ports. Parted Magic now boots with a DVD drive hooked to ASMedia ports. This hangup can be reproduced on almost any newer ASUS board. The problem was not wide spread because most people were not using the SATA3 port for a DVD drive. My wife and I both have ASUS boards and we never experienced these hang ups. It was frustrating, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m glad the problem is now solved.\n\nIn this version youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll notice a set of lips in the panel. A few people requested some sort of speech program, but didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give many details of what they wanted. I hope this is what they were looking for.\n\nYou can now do a memtest from the EFI menu.\n\nClonezilla has been updated to 3.12.7.\n\nXfburn is now compiled to use gstreamer.\n\nAudacity 2.0.6 was added.\n\nFirefox was updated to 34.0.5.\n\nAdded programs: espeak-1.48.04, espeakup-0.71, gst-plugins-base-0.10.36, gst-plugins-good-0.10.31, gstreamer-0.10.36, libvisual-plugins-0.4.0, slang1-1.4.9, audacity-2.0.6, ca-certificates-20130906, disk-usage-analyzer-1.8.1, hexchat-2.10.2, and libcanberra-0.29.\n\nUpdated programs: xf86-input-evdev-2.9.1, ntfs-3g_ntfsprogs-2014.2.15AR.3, mesa-10.4.2, libevdev-1.3, kmod-19, eudev-2.1.1, drbl-2.11.13, clonezilla-3.12.7, wxHexEditor-0.23, mesa-10.4.1, libusb-compat-0.1.5, libusb-1.0.19, lftp-4.6.1, kernel-firmware-20141224git, exfat-utils-1.1.1, clamtk-5.12, clamav-0.98.5, openssl-1.0.1k, mozilla-nss-3.16.5, linux-3.18.2, and mozilla-firefox-34.0.5.\n\n    CRC32: 22317D94\n      MD5: 4D03716AD00E7048DC175D96C7F2F53F\n     SHA1: 21F5EA1C42DA3E67ACA0097868A63DA5F97EB8DA\n   SHA256: DE4C13EF368E53CA2DFC52410F082F180644666BC835BA573D6217294D007DB1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14e165dd042f2b0950375a876d2377e7e6fc10d4","amp;dn":"Parted+Magic+2015-01-13+%28pmagic_2015_01_13.iso%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14e165dd042f2b0950375a876d2377e7e6fc10d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,225,101,221,4,47,43,9,80,55,90,135,109,35,119,231,230,252,16,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
