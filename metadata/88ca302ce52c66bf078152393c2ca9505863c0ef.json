Widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, Miles Davis was, with his musical groups, at the forefront of several major developments in jazz music, including bebop, cool jazz, hard bop, modal jazz, and jazz fusion.\nOn October 7, 2008, his 1959 album Kind of Blue received its fourth platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of at least four million copies in the United States. Miles Davis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Davis was noted as &quot;one of the key figures in the history of jazz&quot;.\nOn November 5, 2009, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan sponsored a measure in the US House of Representatives to recognize and commemorate the album Kind of Blue on its 50th anniversary. The measure also affirms jazz as a national treasure and &quot;encourages the United States government to preserve and advance the art form of jazz music. &quot;It passed, unanimously, with a vote of 409ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“0 on December 15, 2009.\n\n.:Miles Davis:.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/371/milesr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/371/milesr.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFull discography\n\n1.1 - Studio albums - Prestige-Debut, 1945ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1961\n1.2 - Studio albums - Columbia, 1955ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1974\n1.3 - Studio albums - Columbia Warner Bros., 1981ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1991\n2 - Live albums\n3 - Compilations\n4 - Soundtracks\n5.1 - Box sets - Compilation\n5.2 - Box sets - Limited edition\n\nThe albums\nMp3 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ CBR 320kbps\n\nPack 1 (of 2)\n1.1 Studio albums - Prestige-Debut, 1945ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1961\n1.2 Studio albums - Columbia, 1955ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1974\n3 Compilations\n5.1 Box sets - Compilation\n\n1.1 - Studio albums - Prestige-Debut, 1945ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1961\n1948 The Complete Birth Of The Cool @320\n1951 Dig @320\n1952 Dr Jekyll @320\n1953 Blue Haze @320\n1953 Four @320\n1953 Miles Davis and Horns @320\n1954 Bag's Groove @320\n1954 Blue Haze @320\n1954 Walkin - Miles Davis All Stars @320\n1955 Blue Moods @320\n1955 Cookin' @320\n1955 Miles Davis and Milt Jackson Quintet Sextet @320\n1955 Musings of Miles @320\n1955 The New Miles Davis Quintet @320\n1956 Collectors' Items @320\n1956 Miles Davis and The Modern Jazz Giants @320\n1956 Relaxin' With The Miles Davis Quintet @320\n1956 Steamin' With The Miles Davis Quintet @320\n1956 Workin With The Miles Davis Quintet @320\n1958 '58 Sessions (Featuring Stella By Starlight) @320\n1959 Something Else (with Cannonball Adderley) @320\n1990 First Miles 1945-47 (1992 Savoy-Japan) @320\n\n1.2 - Studio albums - Columbia, 1955ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1974\n1956 Round About Midnight @320\n1957 Miles Ahead @320\n1958 1958 Miles @320\n1958 Porgy And Bess @320\n1959 Another Tracks of Kind of Blue @320\n1959 Kind of Blue (50th Anniversary, 2 CD) @320\n1959 Milestones @320\n1961 Someday My Prince Will Come @320\n1962 Sorcerer @320\n1963 Quiet Nights (Miles Davis-Gil Evans) @320\n1963 Seven Steps To Heaven @320\n1965 E S P @320\n1966 Miles Smiles @320\n1967 Nefertiti @320\n1967 Sketches Of Spain @320\n1967 Water Babies @320\n1968 Miles In The Sky @320\n1969 Bitches Brew (40th Anniversary Legacy Edition 2 CD) @320\n1969 Filles De Kilimanjaro @320\n1969 In A Silent Way @320\n1970 Live-Evil (2 CD) @320\n1971 A Tribute To Jack Johnson @320\n1972 Get Up With It (2 CD) @320\n1972 On The Corner @320\n1974 Big Fun (2 CD) @320\n\n3 - Compilations\n1950 Birth Of The Cool (Great Sessions) @320\n1951 Conception @320\n1952 Miles Davis Vol 1 (CD2 Great Sessions) @320\n1953 Miles Davis Vol 2 (CD3 Great Sessions) @320\n1955 Circle In The Round (2 CD) @320\n1957 Bluing - Miles Davis Plays The Blues 1951-56 @320\n1981 Directions (Unreleased Recordings 1960-1970) (2 CD) @320\n1992 The Best of Miles Davis (The Capitol - Blue Note Years) @320\n1996 This is Jazz (Miles Davis acoustic) @320\n1997 Autumn Leaves @320\n1998 Friends @320\n1998 Panthalassa The Music of Miles Davis 1969-1974 @320\n1998 The Complete Columbia Studio Recordings (6 CD 1965-1968) @320\n2000 Ken Burns Jazz @320\n2001 Blue Moods @320\n2001 The Complete Blue Note Sessions (1952-53) (2 CD) @320\n2001 Young Miles (4 CD 1945-1950) @320\nCD1 (Milestones)\nCD2 (Enter the Cool)\nCD3 (Boplicity)\nCD4 (Conception)\n2006 Cool &amp; Collected (The Very Best Of Miles Davis) @320\n\n5.1 - Box sets - Compilation\n1965 The Complete Live at the Plugged Nickel (8 CD) @320\n1968 The Complete In A Silent Way Sessions (3 CD) @320\n1998 The Bitches Brew Sessions (4 CD 1969-70) @320\n2003 The Complete Blackhawk Sessions (4 CD) @320\n2003 The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions (5 CD) @320\n2004 Miles Davis &amp; John Coltrane (6 CD) @320\n2004 Seven Steps (7 CD) @320\n2006 The Complete Legendary Prestige Quintet Sessions (4 CD) @320\n2007 The Complete On The Corner Sessions (6 CD) @320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88ca302ce52c66bf078152393c2ca9505863c0ef","amp;dn":"Miles+Davis+-+Full+Discography+%28Pack+1+of+2%29+%5BMp3+320+kbps%5D+TNT+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88ca302ce52c66bf078152393c2ca9505863c0ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,202,48,44,229,44,102,191,7,129,82,57,60,44,169,80,88,99,192,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
