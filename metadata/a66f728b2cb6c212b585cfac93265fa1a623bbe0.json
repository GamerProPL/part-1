Not only that, but if you have several operations to perform, iPartition lets you queue them up and run them one after another, so you can have a cup of coffee whilst iPartition works. This feature, coupled with iPartition's ability to automatically rearrange your existing partitions when asked to expand a partition, makes iPartition the easiest disk partitioning tool that you'll ever use.\n\nNor does iPartition's ease-of-use come at the expense of power users; iPartition's Partition Map window, coupled with the Inspector, provides total flexibility, even allowing users to edit flags in the partition table, edit the partition type directly, or move or resize partitions accurately anywhere on the disk.\n\nVersion 3.4.0:\n\n* The major new feature in this version is the ability to create a recovery\n  disk with iPartition on an external drive (including USB flash drive).\n  This feature is Mac OS X 10.7 only.\n\n* There are also a number of other bug fixes.\n\nSystem Requirements;\n\nPPC / Intel, Mac OS X 10.4.11 or later.\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n\nNOTE: Use Little Snitch to block app.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a66f728b2cb6c212b585cfac93265fa1a623bbe0","amp;dn":"iPartition+v.+3.4.0+with+%5BK%5Drack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a66f728b2cb6c212b585cfac93265fa1a623bbe0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,111,114,139,44,182,194,18,181,133,207,172,147,38,95,161,166,35,187,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
