Their dedication and hard work have yielded an authoritative volume that defines and classifies mental disorders in order to improve diagnoses, treatment, and research. \n\nThe criteria are concise and explicit, ...show more intended to facilitate an objective assessment of symptom presentations in a variety of clinical settings -- inpatient, outpatient, partial hospital, consultation-liaison, clinical, private practice, and primary care. New features and enhancements make DSM-5 easier to use across all settings: -- The chapter organization reflects a lifespan approach, with disorders typically diagnosed in childhood (such as neurodevelopmental disorders) at the beginning of the manual, and those more typical of older adults (such as neurocognitive disorders) placed at the end.\n\nAlso included are age-related factors specific to diagnosis. -- The latest findings in neuroimaging and genetics have been integrated into each disorder along with gender and cultural considerations.-- The revised organizational structure recognizes symptoms that span multiple diagnostic categories, providing new clinical insight in diagnosis. -- Specific criteria have been streamlined, consolidated, or clarified to be consistent with clinical practice (including the consolidation of autism disorder, Asperger's syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder into autism spectrum disorder; the streamlined classification of bipolar and depressive disorders; the restructuring of substance use disorders for consistency and clarity; and the enhanced specificity for major and mild neurocognitive disorders).-- Dimensional assessments for research and validation of clinical results have been provided.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07ed09d4904b81065e6f62185cb19c661f261dc0","amp;dn":"Diagnostic+and+Statistical+Manual+DSM+5+by+APA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07ed09d4904b81065e6f62185cb19c661f261dc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,237,9,212,144,75,129,6,94,111,98,24,92,177,156,102,31,38,29,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
