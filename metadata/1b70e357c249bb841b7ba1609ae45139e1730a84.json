If youâ€™ve ever searched the Internet for information on that odd rash on your arm, advice to help you get the best nightâ€™s sleep, or tips for staying healthy during cold and flu season, you know there is skill to sorting fiction from scientific fact. How the Body Works uses clear, easy-to-understand graphics and illustrations to demystify all the complex processes that keep our bodies alive and thriving â€” from the basic building blocks of the body â€” our cells â€” to skin, muscles, and bones and the ways in which our many parts work together. Learn about the senses, how we read faces and body language, nutrition and immunity, the brain, sleep, memory, dreams, and much more. Each chapter takes you through a new body system and includes surprising facts like â€œthere are no muscles in the fingers and toesâ€ and â€œby the time you finish reading this sentence, 50 million of your cells will have died and been replaced.â€ With How the Body Works, youâ€™ll understand the how and why as well as be wowed by the astonishing ways our bodies work.\r\n\r\nDK How the Body Works\r\nEnglish | ISBN: 146542993X | 2016 | PDF | 256 pages | 42.93 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b70e357c249bb841b7ba1609ae45139e1730a84","amp;dn":"DK+How+the+Body+Works","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b70e357c249bb841b7ba1609ae45139e1730a84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,112,227,87,194,73,187,132,27,123,161,96,154,228,81,57,225,115,10,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
