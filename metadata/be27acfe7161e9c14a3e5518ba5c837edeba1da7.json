It is said that power belongs to those who have the knowledge and information. This we would like to dispute. Being in the information age, so many data and inputs are available. Tons and tons of materials are readily available with just one click of the mouse. Numerous data are readily available to all people.\n\nYet, how come not all of these people who have access to mountains of materials are considered powerful?\n\nIt is our contention that those who are able to wade through tons of information, comprehend, and make use of that knowledge for meaningful purposes IN A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME are the ones who hold the key to power. Speed is the key.\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be27acfe7161e9c14a3e5518ba5c837edeba1da7","amp;dn":"The+Speed+Reading+Book+%2B+The+Speed+Reading+Monster+Course+%3A+Acce","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be27acfe7161e9c14a3e5518ba5c837edeba1da7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,39,172,254,113,97,233,193,74,62,85,24,186,92,131,126,222,186,29,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
