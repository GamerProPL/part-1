Penny has now been with Koko for over 40 years and claims Koko can reveal fresh insights into the workings of an animal's mind.\r\n\r\nKoko's unique life with Penny has been filmed every step of the way. Over 2,000 hours of footage chart the most dramatic moments - Penny's battle to keep Koko from being taken back to the zoo in which she was born, Penny's clash with academic critics who doubted her claims and the image of Koko mourning the death of her kitten. Penny believes that Koko has moved beyond simple language to express complex emotions - such as a longing for a baby gorilla of her own, and that the empathy she evokes in people changes their attitudes to all animals.\r\n\r\nThis film explores what we can really learn from this extraordinary science experiment turned love affair. Does it tell us more about animal emotions or our own?\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 19 (~2175Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 58 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 959 MB\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea3c0f8fea1da1765a6525b8855e7a77ec54b17e","amp;dn":"BBC+Koko%3A+The+Gorilla+Who+Talks+to+People+720p+HDTV+x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea3c0f8fea1da1765a6525b8855e7a77ec54b17e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,60,15,143,234,29,161,118,90,101,37,184,133,94,122,119,236,84,177,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
