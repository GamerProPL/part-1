From there youâ€™ll embark on a quest to survive, discover, explore and fight your way across an infinite universe. \r\n\r\nYouâ€™ll encounter procedurally generated creatures and weapons, discover populated villages and abandoned temples. Explore planets dotted with dungeons, eyeball trees and treasure. Make use of over a hundred materials and over one thousand in-game objects to build a sprawling modern metropolis or a sleepy secluded cabin in the woods, and do all of it alone or with friends!\r\n\r\nStarbound lets you live out your own story of space exploration, discovery and adventure. Settle down and farm the land, hop from planet to planet claiming resources, or make regular visits to populated settlements, taking on jobs and earning a living. NPCs are scattered about the worlds, offering quests and challenges for those looking for a little extra excitement in their lives","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9359731ac4d06684430e89f4566824e4ad1b91b","amp;dn":"Starbound+v1.1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9359731ac4d06684430e89f4566824e4ad1b91b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,53,151,49,172,77,6,104,68,48,232,159,69,102,130,78,74,209,185,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
