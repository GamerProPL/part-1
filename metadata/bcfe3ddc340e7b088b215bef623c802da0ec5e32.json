Soon, Popeye cartoons were published as comic strips in many famous newspapers as well. The name of this Popeye cartoons strip was Thimble Theater, which was because the classic cartoon characters acted the stories in a more of theatrical manner. It would be a matter of shock for the viewers and fans to know that Popeye cartoons never had Popey as the main cartoon character. Initially, in the strips, the main classic cartoon characters were Olive Oyl and her boyfriend named Harold Hamgravy and not Popey. Then Olive OylÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brother came into the picture by the name Castor Oyl and OliveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s parents name Cole Oyl and Nana Oyl. Till almost 10 years, this classic cartoon continued as it was with Harold Hamgravy but then came the hero, the Popey. This classic cartoon character gained so much of fame that he was given a larger role than the main character of Harold. With time, Popey replaced Harold. The Popeye cartoons showed that Olive Oyl left Harold and started dating Popey with which his role could be expanded now. As everyone say this was done just to expand the cartoon.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popeye&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popeye&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcfe3ddc340e7b088b215bef623c802da0ec5e32","amp;dn":"Popeye+The+Sailor+-+All+Cartoon+TV+SERIES+on+one+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcfe3ddc340e7b088b215bef623c802da0ec5e32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,254,61,220,52,14,123,8,139,33,91,239,98,60,128,45,160,236,94,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
