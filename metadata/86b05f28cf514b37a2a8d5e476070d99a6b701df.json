The band was founded by guitarist and vocalist David Davidson, bassist and vocalist Anthony Buda and drummer Phil Dubois-Coyne in 2000. The band was originally known as Cryptic Warning, but it changed its name to Revocation in 2006. The band released two studio albums, Empire of the Obscene and Existence Is Futile in 2008 and 2009 respectively, and subsequently signed to Relapse Records.\n\nIn 2000, guitarist/vocalist David Davidson, drummer Phil Dubois-Coyne and bassist Anthony Buda, who attended a high school in Boston, Massachusetts, formed Cryptic Warning, influenced by Guns N' Roses and Metallica. The band recorded its first demo in 2002 and gained an underground following in Boston, also performing outside of Massachusetts. A second demo, Internally Reviled, was recorded in 2004. In 2005, Cryptic Warning recorded its debut studio album, Sanity's Aberration, but was not content with the quality of the album's production. Remembering those recordings, Davidson said: &quot;We didn't record the album with a metal guy, so we didn't get the sound we wanted. The heaviest reference in our producer's discography was The Cult. A lot of people still love that recordÃ¢â‚¬â€our old-school fans who used to show up for all of the showsÃ¢â‚¬â€but to us, we weren't really satisfied with the production of that. We felt it was one of the mistakes we made.&quot;\n\nThe band decided to change its name to Revocation in 2006; Davidson commented: &quot;I think, looking a little deeper into it, we made a lot of mistakes with Cryptic Warning. We were younger and didn't really know what we were doing, so Revocation was us starting fresh with a clean slate and revoking our past mistakes.&quot; With a direction change, Revocation promptly recorded a three-song demo titled Summon the Spawn, and in 2008 they went back into the studio to record their first full length album, Empire of the Obscene. The full length was self-released, and the band financed its own tour, attracting the interest of several record labels. Revocation subsequently signed to Relapse Records.\n\nThe band did a number of regional shows before recording its second full-length album, Existence Is Futile, released on September 29, 2009. The album was described by Allmusic as &quot;one of the best pure metal albums of 2009&quot;, while Spin magazine named Revocation as one of the ten artists to watch in 2010. In October 2009, the band performed for the Relapse showcase at CMJ Music Marathon.\n\n\nGenre:\tDeath\nSubgenre:\tTechnical Death / Thrash Metal\nBitrate:\t256 k\nSize:\t100.45 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n11 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86b05f28cf514b37a2a8d5e476070d99a6b701df","amp;dn":"Revocation+-+Deathless+mp3++%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86b05f28cf514b37a2a8d5e476070d99a6b701df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,176,95,40,207,81,75,55,162,168,213,228,118,7,13,153,166,183,1,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
