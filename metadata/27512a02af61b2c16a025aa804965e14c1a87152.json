ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bullet-hell beat-em-up meets old-school RPG, in an arcadey party-game for up to 4 players.\n\n\nOne player is the hero, exploring a randomly generated dungeon full of traps and monsters - all controlled by the other players. If you slay the hero you take their place and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your turn to crawl! Then it's a race to gain enough XP and loot to reach the final battle, where it's all on one as the other players collectively control the hulking final boss!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27512a02af61b2c16a025aa804965e14c1a87152","amp;dn":"Crawl+v0.6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27512a02af61b2c16a025aa804965e14c1a87152","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,81,42,2,175,97,178,193,106,2,90,168,4,150,94,20,193,168,113,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
