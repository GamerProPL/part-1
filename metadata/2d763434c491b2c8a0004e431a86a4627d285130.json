Stan GetzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ tone and performance style fits in seamlessly with Oscar PetersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s renowned trio, consisting of guitarist Herb Ellis and bassist Ray Brown.\n\nVerve Records founder Norman Granz, who played a large part in developing Oscar PetersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career, was responsible for bringing Peterson and Getz into the studio to record this indelible album.\n\nFrom the outset of the recording, the band is at peak performance. The opening track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Want to Be Happy,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ sounds relaxed and lighthearted in spite of its fast clip. GetzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ technique is flawless, allowing him to execute nimble and tuneful phrases one after the other. When Peterson takes over, the blithe mood intensifies, swelling with excitement. Afterward, Getz is inspired to solo again, this time increasingly impassioned.\n\nOn the laidback Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pennies from Heaven,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Getz invokes the tone and vibrato of his hero and main stylistic influence Lester Young. His updated and refined take on a classic sound has in turn become one of the most notable developments in the history of jazz saxophone.\nThe ballads on Stan Getz and the Oscar Peterson Trio contrast beautifully with the bouncing and swinging numbers, and most of them are packaged together in a medley that features five in a row. The string of standards, which includes such well-known tunes as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Polkadots and Moonbeam,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ showcases GetzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ soulful ability to affect bittersweet nostalgia with his whispery melodies.\n\nFor fans of Oscar Peterson and Stan Getz, this album is sure to please. No matter what your preference is, Stan Getz and the Oscar Peterson Trio will delight you with its range of moods and its perfect musical execution.\n\n \n \nTracklist:\n\n1. I Want to be Happy\n\n2.
