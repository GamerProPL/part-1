When you master one exercise, you move on to the next, and so on. Because the later exercises build on the earlier ones, they are sometimes called the &quot;ten steps&quot;. When you reach the tenth exercise, you will be just about as strong as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possible for a human being to be in that movement. For this reason, the tenth exercise in any chain is called the &quot;Master Step&quot;. How this all works will be crystal clear if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve picked up a copy of the Convict Conditioning bodyweight book.\nWhy every self-respecting man will be religious about his squatsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nLeg training is vital for every athlete. A well-trained, muscular upper body teetering around on skinny stick legs is a joke. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be that joke! The mighty squat is the answer to your prayers. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why:\n\n*  Squats train virtually every muscle in the lower body, from quads and glutes to hips, lower back and even hamstrings.\n\n*  Squat deepÃ¢â‚¬â€as weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll teach youÃ¢â‚¬â€and you will seriously increase your flexibility and ankle strength.\n\n*  All functional power is transmitted through the legs, so without strong, powerful legs you are nothingÃ¢â‚¬â€that goes for running, jumping and combat sports as much as it does for lifting heavy stuff.\nAre you failing to build monstrous legs from squatsÃ¢â‚¬â€because of these mistakes?\n\nMost trainees learn how to squat on two legs, and then make the exercise harder by slapping a barbell across their back. In prison, this way of adding strength wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always available, so cell trainees developed ways of progressing using only bodyweight versus gravity. The best way to do this is to learn how to squat all the way down to the ground and back up on just one leg.\n\nNot everybody who explores prison training will have the dedication and drive to achieve strength feats like the one-arm pullup, but the legs are much stronger than the arms. If you put in the time and work hard, the one-leg squat will be within the reach of almost every athlete who pays their dues.\n\nBut the one-leg squat still requires very powerful muscles and tendons, so you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to jump into one-leg squatting right away. You need to build the joint strength and muscle to safely attempt this great exercise. Discover how to do that safely, using ten steps, ten progressively harder squat exercises.\nIn the strength game, fools rush in where angels fear to tread\n\nThe wise old Chinese man shouted to his rickshaw driver: &quot;Slow down, young man, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m in a hurry!&quot; If ever a warning needed to be shouted to our nation of compulsive strength-addicts, this would be it. You see them everywhere: the halt, the lame, the jacked-up, the torn, the pain-riddenÃ¢â‚¬â€the former glory-seekers who have been reduced to sad husks of their former selves by rushing helter-skelter into heavy lifting without having first built a firm foundation.\n\nPaul Wade reveals the ten key points of perfect squat form. The aspects of proper form apply to all your squats, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll not only unlock the muscle and power-building potential of each rep you do, but theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also keep you as safe as you can be. Bodyweight training is all about improving strength and health, not building up a list of injuries or aches and pains. They are so fundamental, we call them the Ten Commandments of good squat form.\n\nObey the Ten Commandments, follow the brilliantly laid out progressions religiously and you simply CANNOT fail to get stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and strongerÃ¢â‚¬â€surely, safely and for as long as you liveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28636741f2015ae81c66602c0da7dd4f2dd47f4f","amp;dn":"Convict.Conditioning.Volume.2.Squats+Dvdrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28636741f2015ae81c66602c0da7dd4f2dd47f4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,99,103,65,242,1,90,232,28,102,96,44,13,167,221,79,45,212,127,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
