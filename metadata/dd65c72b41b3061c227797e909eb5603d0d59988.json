Live at the Beacon Theater&quot; which will be available exclusively on my website http://www.louisck.com starting on December 10th for 5 dollars via paypal. You can stream or download the special or both. It is only available on the site. \n\nMessage from louie to piratebay:\n\nTo those who might wish to &quot;torrent&quot; this video: look, I don't really get the whole &quot;torrent&quot; thing. I don't know enough about it to judge either way. But I'd just like you to consider this: I made this video extremely easy to use against well-informed advice. I was told that it would be easier to torrent the way I made it, but I chose to do it this way anyway, because I want it to be easy for people to watch and enjoy this video in any way they want without &quot;corporate&quot; restrictions.\nPlease bear in mind that I am not a company or a corporation. I'm just some guy. I paid for the production and posting of this video with my own money. I would like to be able to post more material to the fans in this way, which makes it cheaper for the buyer and more pleasant for me. So, please help me keep this being a good idea. I can't stop you from torrenting; all I can do is politely ask you to pay your five little dollars, enjoy the video, and let other people find it in the same way.\nSincerely, \nLouis C.K.\n\nIF U LIKE IT BUY IT OR I WILL DELETE IT \n\nTHIS IS A TASTE BUY ART TO APPRECIATE IT \nthx\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nFuture of DUBSTEP           &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6624204/Future_Of_Dubstep_2011_(SUPER_NEW__)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6624204/Future_Of_Dubstep_2011_(SUPER_NEW__)&lt;/a&gt;\n          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6780143/Future_Of_DUBstep_2012_(ELECTRONIC)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6780143/Future_Of_DUBstep_2012_(ELECTRONIC)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nVOLUME 31 - NEW\n\n3 gigs of pure music made by me \nFor more rap music , hip hop , electronic, over 5 genres\nover 3 gigs!\nultimate mixtape \nelectronic, and 80s music all in one\nu gotta get this\n          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6746589/Digital_Crack_Vol_31_-_Ultimate_Hip_Hop_-_Electro_MiXtape_&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6746589/Digital_Crack_Vol_31_-_Ultimate_Hip_Hop_-_Electro_MiXtape_&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\ncheck out my other unique cool torrents\namerican greed season 4\ncrank yankers season 3\njersey shore season 4\nphil hendrie show all years\nPerfect Photo Suite 6\nand over 40 gigs of music !\n          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/atndigcrk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/atndigcrk/&lt;/a&gt;\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd65c72b41b3061c227797e909eb5603d0d59988","amp;dn":"Louis+ck+-+Louis+C.K+%3A+Live+At+The+Beacon+Theater+%282011%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd65c72b41b3061c227797e909eb5603d0d59988","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,101,199,43,65,179,6,28,34,119,151,233,9,235,86,3,208,213,153,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
