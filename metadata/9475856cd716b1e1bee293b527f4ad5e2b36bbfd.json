Demystifying DSM-5 criteria without sacrificing accuracy, the book includes both ICD-10-CM and ICD-9-CM codes for each disorder. It also includes the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale (from DSM-IV-TR), with a clear rationale for its continued use. More than 130 detailed case vignettes illustrate typical patient presentations; down-to-earth discussions of each case demonstrate how to arrive at the diagnosis and rule out other likely possibilities. Providing a wealth of diagnostic pointers, Morrison writes with the wisdom and wit that made his guide to the prior DSM a valued resource for hundreds of thousands of clinicians. His website (www.guilford.com/jm) offers additional discussion and resources related to psychiatric diagnosis and DSM-5.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9475856cd716b1e1bee293b527f4ad5e2b36bbfd","amp;dn":"DSM-5+Made+Easy%2C+The+Clinician%27s+Guide+to+Diagnosis+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStorm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9475856cd716b1e1bee293b527f4ad5e2b36bbfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,117,133,108,215,22,177,225,190,226,147,181,39,244,173,94,43,54,187,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
