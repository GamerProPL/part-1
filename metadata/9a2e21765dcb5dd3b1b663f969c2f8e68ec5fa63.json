We have taken this natural process, through which you learned your own language, and adapted it to our books and audio courses. Working progressively, with natural, lively dialogues, simple text notes and exercises, you will progress steadily to a level where you are able to converse in everyday situations. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The first part of the course is the passive phase: you immerse yourself in the language by reading and repeating each lesson. \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ During the second, active phase, you use the structures and reflexes you have already absorbed while continuing to advance and learn. \n\nIn just a few months, you will be able to speak German easily, fluently and naturally. \n\nWhat does this course consist of? \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ lively, natural dialogues that allow you to master the language quickly\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ realistic, practical situations in a contemporary context\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ a carefully designed system of grammatical progression for intuitive learning\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ systematic review to consolidate what you have learned\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ fascinating cultural insights\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ a witty and engaging style to make learning enjoyable\n\n\nThis pack includes the Assimil German - English book, as well as the MP3 audio.
