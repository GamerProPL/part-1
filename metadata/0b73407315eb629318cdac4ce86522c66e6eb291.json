Author George Maestri focuses on the features available in Pro that make SketchUp a valuable design tool. He demonstrates the new Dynamic Components and shows how using them can add interactivity to a model. He teaches how to create custom Dynamic Components from models, which is a feature unique to Pro. He also explores SketchUp Pro's companion application, LayOut, a presentation tool that retains the editability of models even when they're embedded in documents. Last but not least, George shows how to export and import objects to and from other programs, such as AutoCAD and 3ds Max. Exercise files accompany this course.\nTopics include:\nMaking custom Dynamic Components\nDrawing with Layout\nEditing textures outside of SketchUp\nCreating and managing styles with the Style Builder\nExporting objects for rendering\nCreating scrapbooks and presentations\nExporting model attributes to reports","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b73407315eb629318cdac4ce86522c66e6eb291","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Google+SketchUp+Pro%3A+Tools+and+Techniques","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b73407315eb629318cdac4ce86522c66e6eb291","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,115,64,115,21,235,98,147,24,205,172,76,232,101,34,198,110,110,178,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
