The group was best known for their string of hit singles on Motown's &quot;Soul&quot; record label and Buddah Records from 1967 to 1975, including &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; (1967) and &quot;Midnight Train to Georgia&quot; (1973). The longest-lived incarnation of the act featured Gladys Knight on lead vocals, with The Pips, who included her brother Merald &quot;Bubba&quot; Knight and their cousins Edward Patten and William Guest, as backup singers.\n\nGladys Knight was born May 28, 1944 in Atlanta, Georgia. At the age of seven in 1952, she won Ted Mack's Original Amateur Hour television show contest. The following year, she, her brother Bubba, sister Brenda, and their cousins William and Eleanor Guest started a singing group called &quot;The Pips&quot; (named after another cousin, James &quot;Pip&quot; Woods). The Pips began to perform and tour, eventually replacing Brenda Knight and Eleanor Guest with cousins Langston George and Edward Patten in 1959.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Every Beat Of My Heart\n02.Letter Full Of Tears\n03.Giving Up\n04.Just Walk In My Shoes\n05.Since I've Lost You\n06.Take Me In Your Arms And Love Me\n07.Everybody Needs Love\n08.I Heard It Through The Grapevine\n09.End Of Our Road\n10.Don't Let Her Take Your Love From Me\n11.All I Could Do Was Cry\n12.It Should Have Been Me\n13.I Wish It Would Rain\n14.Didn't You Know (You'd Have To Cry Sometime)\n15.Got Myself A Good Man\n16.I Want Him To Say It Again\n17.The Nitty Gritty\n18.I Know I'm Losing You\n19.Cloud Nine\n20.Every Little Bit Hurts\n21.Billy, Come Back As Quick As You Can\n22.It's Bad For Me To See You\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Friendship Train\n02.Tracks Of My Tears\n03.You Need Love Like I Do (Don't You)\n04.If I Were Your Woman\n05.I Don't Want To Do Wrong\n06.It's All Over But The Shoutin'\n07.Somebody Stole The Sunshine\n08.For Once In My Life\n09.Feeling Alright\n10.Make Me The Woman That You Go Home To\n11.If You Gonna Leave (Just Leave)\n12.Help Me Make It Through The Night\n13.Neither One Of Us Wants To Be The First (To Say Goodbye)\n14.Daddy Could Swear, I Declare\n15.Can't Give It Up No More\n16.All I Need Is Time\n17.Only Time You Love Me Is When You're Losing Me\n18.Between Her Goodbye And My Hello\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e127dd7b0813df319904ab2ad8258e95958d07f","amp;dn":"Gladys+Knight+%26+The+Pips+-+The+Best+Of++%281995%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e127dd7b0813df319904ab2ad8258e95958d07f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,18,125,215,176,129,61,243,25,144,74,178,173,130,88,233,89,88,208,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
