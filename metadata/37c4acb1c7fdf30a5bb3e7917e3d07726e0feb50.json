Like nearly all of Kerouac's writing, On The Road is thinly fictionalised autobiography, filled with a cast made of Kerouac's real life friends, lovers and fellow travellers. Narrated by Sal Paradise, one of Kerouac's alter-egos, this cross-country bohemian odyssey not only influenced writing in the years since its 1957 publication but penetrated into the deepest levels of American thought and culture\n\nOn the Road swings to the rhythms of 1950s underground America, jazz, sex, generosity, chill dawns and drugs, with Sal Paradise and his hero Dean Moriarty, traveller and mystic, the living epitome of Beat. Now recognized as a modern classic, its American Dream is nearer that of Walt Whitman than Scott Fitzgerald, and it goes racing towards the sunset with unforgettable exuberance, poignancy and autobiographical passion.\n\n\n\nNovels and Other Fiction\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢The Sea Is My Brother (1942)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Orpheus Emerged,  (1944-1945; published 2002)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks, with William S.
