In the early '70s, when he appeared with his introspective songs, acoustic guitar, and calm, understated singing style, he mirrored a generation's emotional exhaustion after tumultuous times. Just as Bing Crosby's reassuring voice brought the country out of the Depression and through World War II, Taylor's eased the transition from '60s activism and its attendant frustrations into the less political, more inward-looking '70s. He was rewarded with a series of hit albums and singles (surprisingly, many of the latter were covers of old songs rather than his own compositions), and he managed to survive his initial fame to achieve lasting popularity. He continued to tour successfully for decades, and, starting with his 1970 breakthrough Sweet Baby James, all but one of his regular album releases for the rest of the century went gold or platinum, while his 1976 Greatest Hits album achieved a diamond certification reflecting sales of more than ten million copies. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\n\n\n01.Something In The Way She Moves\n02.Sweet Baby James\n03.Fire And Rain\n04.Country Road (Single Version)\n05.You've Got A Friend\n06.You Can Close Your Eyes\n07.Long Ago And Far Away\n08.Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight\n09.Walking Man\n10.How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)\n11.Mexico\n12.Shower The People\n13.Golden Moments\n14.Steamroller Blues (Live)\n15.Carolina In My Mind (1976 Version)\n16.Handy Man\n17.Your Smiling Face\n18.Up On The Roof\n19.Only A Dream In Rio\n20.Bittersweet\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d7e007e00cbc809b4a64617a8ea44449b6c5cfd","amp;dn":"James+Taylor+-+The+Best+Of+%282003%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d7e007e00cbc809b4a64617a8ea44449b6c5cfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,126,0,126,0,203,200,9,180,166,70,23,168,234,68,68,155,108,92,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
