These recipes have a common thread: simple details â€“ a squeeze of burnt lemon, a toasting of nuts, or a spoonful of piquant green sauce â€“ which elevate flash-in-the-pan plates and slowly-stirred pots alike into something special. This pared-back approach to food is simple and achievable, and will transform your everyday cooking","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c47a323726f2269b0f4286d4937909b12d7c71a5","amp;dn":"Ducksoup+Cookbook+%282016%29+%28Epub%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c47a323726f2269b0f4286d4937909b12d7c71a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,122,50,55,38,242,38,155,15,66,134,212,147,121,9,177,45,124,113,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
