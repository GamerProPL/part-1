He has survived for weeks at a time in harsh situations and in isolated, challenging environments. Offering us a rare glimpse of some of the world's most remote cultures Ã¢â‚¬â€ such as the Sea Gypsies in Malaysia and the San Bushmen in Africa Ã¢â‚¬â€ Beyond Survivorman covers his most challenging journey of all: learning not only how to survive but also how to connect spiritually to the earth.\n\nBeyond Survivorman\nBook Language: English \nPages: 320\nFile Type: epub\nFile Size: 127 MB\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re alone in the forest on a fine autumn day with nothing but a multitool. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re stuck there for a week. Should you be more worried about finding a source of uncontaminated water or about a bear that might be in the area? Neither, says Les Stroud. The bear will most likely avoid you, and dehydration will affect you faster than parasites in untreated water. Your bigger worry should be shelterÃ¢â‚¬â€the daytime might be nice, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s likely going to be cold at night. And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just the beginning.\n\nThe concept of Survivorman is simple: left in a remote location, Les must survive for seven days on his own without food, water or equipment. Now, he shares his expert knowledge inSurvive!, a fully illustrated guide based on his experiences on six continents and filled with field-tested advice. Many books on survival are culled from Second World WarÃ¢â‚¬â€œera training techniques that are out-of-date or just plain wrong. Survive! debunks these dated myths, exploring basic and advanced tactics that show you how to cope in any survival situation.\n\nBrought to life with LesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own anecdotes and the tales of others, Survive! is the perfect manual for anyone -- from beginner to armchair traveller to seasoned explorer -- who wants to meet natureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dangers with confidence. As Les writes, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If you believe you can make it through the bad times, and you are not intimidated by the forces of nature, you will markedly increase your chances of survival.\n\nSURVIVE! includes detailed information on the following:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ preparing for survival, mentally and physically\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ fire-making techniques\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ basic survival kit components\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ finding, collecting and making water\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ sources of food\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ types of shelter\n\nSurvive\nBook Language: English \nPages: 382\nFile Type: pdf, epub, mobi\nFile Size: 18.5 MB\n\nIn a survival situation, life really does hang in the balance, and a wrong decision could spell the difference between life and death. No one knows this better than Les Stroud, who has survived everywhere from the sun-scorched sands of the Kalahari to the snake--infested jungles of the Amazon. In Will to Live, Les examines a host of famous and less well-known (but no less compelling) survival stories, and he not only explains what happened and why but also offers perspective on what went right, what went wrong and what could have been done differently.\n\nWill to Live is a compilation of historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most intriguing survival stories by one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foremost experts, and includes the tales of\n\nChris McCandless -- subject of Into the Wild\nYossi Ghinsberg -- who survived alone in the Amazon for twenty-one days\nDouglas Mawson -- the Antarctic Ã¢â‚¬Å“supermanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ who survived three hellish months at the bottom of the planet\nNando Parrado -- who was trapped for two months high in the Andes after a plane crash killed his friends and family.\n\nCompelling, surprising and intriguing, Will to Live also includes stories from LesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own experiences, along with sidebars that include practical tips on how to escape quicksand, butcher a moose, cross a snow-covered crevasse and more.\n\nWill to Live: Dispatches from the Edge of Survival\nBook Language: English \nPages: 304\nFile Type: pdf, epub\nFile Size: 6.06 MB\n\nIt's the best of the worst!
