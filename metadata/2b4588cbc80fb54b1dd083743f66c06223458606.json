He was elected to the AcadÃ©mie franÃ§aise in 1896, and won the 1921 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;in recognition of his brilliant literary achievements, characterized as they are by a nobility of style, a profound human sympathy, grace, and a true Gallic temperament.&quot;\n\nThe son of a bookseller, France began his literary career as a poet and a journalist, and became famous with the novel LE CRIME DE SYLVESTRE BONNARD (1881) about a philologist in love with his books and bewildered by everyday life.  Several early works evoke the transition from paganism to Christianity, including BALTHAZAR (1889), a fanciful version of the story of one of the Magi, and THAÃS (1890), the story of the conversion of an Alexandrian courtesan during the Christian era.\n\nA marked change in his work first appears in four volumes collected under the title Lâ€™HISTOIRE CONTEMPORAINE (1897-1901).  The last volume, MONSIEUR BERGERET IN PARIS (1901), concerns the participation of the hero, who had formerly held himself aloof from political strife, in the Alfred Dreyfus affair.  This work is the story of Anatole France himself, who was diverted from his role of an armchair philosopher and detached observer of life by his commitment to support the Jewish officer falsely convicted of espionage.\n\nIn his later years France became increasingly interested in social questions.  PENGUIN ISLAND (1908) is a satirical history of France and human nature that depicts the transformation of penguins into humans, and concludes with a dystopian future.  THE GODS WILL HAVE BLOOD (1912), about a true-believing follower of Robespierre and his contribution to the Reign of Terror of 1793-94, is a wake-up call against political and ideological fanaticism.\n\nFrance has been faulted for the thinness of his plots and for his lack of a vital creative imagination.  His works are, however, considered remarkable for their wide-ranging erudition, their wit and irony, their passion for social justice, and their classical clarity, qualities that mark France as an heir to the tradition of Denis Diderot and Voltaire.\n\nThe following books are in PDF or ePUB format as indicated:\n\n\n                          == FICTION, PLAYS, AND POETRY ==\n\n* Bee: The Princess of the Dwarfs (Open Road, 2014).
