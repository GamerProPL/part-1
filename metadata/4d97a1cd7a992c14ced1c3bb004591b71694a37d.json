You'll learn how to maintain, secure, troubleshoot, install, control, and configure basic network infrastructure. This course offers the perfect way to kick off your network admin career or improve on the networking skills you already have. It's also a terrific introduction to computer networking for business professionals of any stripe. \n\nThis exciting course begins by providing you a solid foundation of how computer networks operate, and builds upon that knowledge with real-world examples of network technologies and protocols including the OSI model, TCP/IP, DNS, ARP, IP addressing (including sub-netting), and media types and connectors including fiber optics, copper, and wireless. \n\nKeith uses real-world experience and analogies to explain complex topics in simple, easy-to-digest, bite-sized chunks, and makes it fun. In addition to live demonstrations as examples of the technologies taught in the videos, Keith includes protocol analyses (where Keith uses a protocol analyzer to show the details of what is really happening on the network) to reinforce the concepts and ideas learned in the videos. The new Network+ video course covers each and every topic in the latest blueprint for the 2011 N10-005 exam, and each Nugget maps to a specific exam objective. \n\nRelated area of expertise:\nNetworking level 1\n\nBuy Videos if u like them","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d97a1cd7a992c14ced1c3bb004591b71694a37d","amp;dn":"CBT.Nuggets+-+CompTIA.Network%2B+N10-005+EnCod3r","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d97a1cd7a992c14ced1c3bb004591b71694a37d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,151,161,205,122,153,44,20,206,209,195,187,0,69,145,183,22,148,163,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
