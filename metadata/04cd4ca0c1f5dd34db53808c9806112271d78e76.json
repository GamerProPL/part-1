But they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know this yet . . . So begins the story of this exquisite debut novel, about a Chinese American family living in 1970s small-town Ohio. Lydia is the favorite child of Marilyn and James Lee; their middle daughter, a girl who inherited her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bright blue eyes and her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jet-black hair. Her parents are determined that Lydia will fulfill the dreams they were unable to pursueÃ¢â‚¬â€in MarilynÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s case that her daughter become a doctor rather than a homemaker, in JamesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s case that Lydia be popular at school, a girl with a busy social life and the center of every party.\n\nWhen LydiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body is found in the local lake, the delicate balancing act that has been keeping the Lee family together tumbles into chaos, forcing them to confront the long-kept secrets that have been slowly pulling them apart. James, consumed by guilt, sets out on a reckless path that may destroy his marriage. Marilyn, devastated and vengeful, is determined to find a responsible party, no matter what the cost. LydiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s older brother, Nathan, is certain that the neighborhood bad boy Jack is somehow involved. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the youngest of the familyÃ¢â‚¬â€HannahÃ¢â‚¬â€who observes far more than anyone realizes and who may be the only one who knows the truth about what happened.\n\nA profoundly moving story of family, history, and the meaning of home, Everything I Never Told You is both a gripping page-turner and a sensitive family portrait, exploring the divisions between cultures and the rifts within a family, and uncovering the ways in which mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, and husbands and wives struggle, all their lives, to understand one another.\n\n**\n\nReview\n\nAn Amazon Best Book of the Month, July 2014: Lydia is dead. From the first sentence of Celeste NgÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stunning debut, we know that the oldest daughter of the Chinese-American Lee family has died. What follows is a novel that explores alienation, achievement, race, gender, family, and identity--as the police must unravel what has happened to Lydia, the Lee family must uncover the sister and daughter that they hardly knew. There isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a false note in this book, and my only concern in describing my profound admiration for Everything I Never Told You is that it might raise unachievable expectations in the reader. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that good. Achingly, precisely, and sensitively written. --Chris Schluep","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04cd4ca0c1f5dd34db53808c9806112271d78e76","amp;dn":"Everything+I+Never+Told+You+-+Celeste+NG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04cd4ca0c1f5dd34db53808c9806112271d78e76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,205,76,160,193,245,221,52,219,83,128,140,152,6,17,34,113,215,142,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
