Giving the user the ability to draw comparisons at both a high and low-level. You can get information about the CPU, chipset, video adapter, ports, printers, sound card, memory, network, Windows internals, AGP, ODBC Connections, USB2, 1394/Firewire, etc.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢4 native architectures support (x86, x64/AMD64/EM64T, IA64/Itanium2, ARM).\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢2 native GPGPU platforms support (AMD CTM/STREAM1, nVidia CUDA1, future Intel).\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢3 native Graphics platforms support (DirectX 9, DirectX 10/10.1).\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢23 established benchmarking modules, 4 new to this version.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Huge official hardware support through technology partners (Intel, AMD/ATI, SiS, VIA).\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢7 charting options: combined, components, performance vs. speed/power/cost, capacity vs. power/cost charts.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢6 language versions (English, German, French, Italian, Russian, Chinese) in a single installer.\n\n\nWhat's New: \n\n(November 11th, 2014)\n\nBroad Operating System Support:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Enhanced for Windows 10 / Server 2015 Desktop mode using the latest API.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢New theme for Windows 10 / 8.1 / 8 with high-DPI support (200% 192ppi) 256x256 pixels icons.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Full support for Windows 8, 7, Vista as well as Server 2012/R2, 2008/R2.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Updated hardware support for both current and future hardware\n\nUpdated Device Performance Certification:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Certify the validity and quality of your benchmarks results [Commercial versions]\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Device Performance Certification validates whether the benchmark result (score) you have obtained upon benchmarking your device is valid (i.e. the device you tested is performing correctly) and how it compares to the scores obtained by other users when testing the same device.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢By aggregating the results submitted for each device and performing statistical analysis (e.g. computing mean/average, standard deviation, etc.) we can use statistical tools to work out whether the score is within the expected range (confidence intervals).\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Based on the variability of scores you can determine whether the performance of your device is consistent or varies significantly from test to test.\n\nUpdated Overall Score (2015) benchmark for complete system performance evaluation:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢14 benchmarks to fully evaluate computer performance\n\nWhile each benchmark measures the performance of a specific device (CPU, Memory, (GP)GPU, Storage, etc.), there is a real need for a benchmark to evaluate the overall computer performance: this new benchmark is a weighted average of the individual scores of the existing benchmarks:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Native CPU Arithmetic, Cryptographic, Multi-Media (SIMD), Financial and Scientific: measures native processing performance using the very latest instruction sets (AVX2, FMA, AVX, SSE2 and future AVX-512F)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Net/Java Arithmetic: measures software virtual machine performance (e.g. for .Net WPF/Silverlight/Modern applications)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Memory and Cache Bandwidth and Latency: measures memory and caches performance\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢File System/Storage Bandwidth and I/O: measures storage performance\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢GP (General Processing) / HC (Heterogonous Compute) (GPU/APU) Arithmetic, Financial, Scientific: measures (GP)GPU/APU processing performance\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢GP (General Processing) / HC (Heterogonous Compute) (GPU/APU) Memory Bandwidth and Latency: measures (GP)GPU/APU memory performance\n\nBrand new style for Windows 10:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Windows 10 / 8.x have their own style (Modern, ex-Metro) shared with Windows Phone 8.x. Love it or hate it, it is here to stay. We have also provided Windows 7, Vista and XP* users with an updated, modern style.\n\nPrice Engine - invaluable:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Why? The Price engine enhances the user's experience by providing product pictures and additional specifications - as well as the the latest price. It enables the calculation of important metrics like Performance vs. Price and Capacity vs. Price (for storage media) which are extremely useful when making comparisons. All this is done automatically rather than manually searching for pricing, a great time saver","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95d568ab64e20afb6ef2e0db955dc7e0889916e1","amp;dn":"SiSoftware+Sandra+Business+2015.01.21.10+%2B+Keygen-FFF+%5BATOM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95d568ab64e20afb6ef2e0db955dc7e0889916e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,213,104,171,100,226,10,251,110,242,224,219,149,93,199,224,136,153,22,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
