Share work directly from within the application and get access to new features the moment they're released. Your entire creative world, together in one place.\n\nLive 3D Pipeline\nObjects and scenes from popular 3D modeling and animation software CINEMA 4D can be used directly as footage inside After Effects CC without rendering first. This eases roundtripping between the programs and opens up numerous creative possibilities.\n\nRefine Edge tool\nIt's the end of hard matte lines. Keep the details when separating complicated foreground elements like frizzy hair or motion-blurred edges from complex backgrounds. This means you can create natural-looking composites without keying specially shot footage.\n\nWarp Stabilizer VFX\nA major upgrade to the much-loved Warp Stabilizer, VFX adds the ability to choose which objects within a scene get stabilized, reverse a stabilization, and preserve a sceneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original scale to fix tricky shots such as aerial fly-throughs.\n\n3D Camera Tracker\nThe 3D Camera Tracker makes it possible to reproduce the original camera movement in a scene so you can add new layers Ã¢â‚¬â€ including video and text layers. It also now features much-requested Track Optimization, so you can refine tracking points over time.\n\nGlobal Performance Cache\nCreate more in less time, even in high-resolution projects. With Global Performance Cache, your previews are saved and ready when you are, even if you close a project and open it later. Duplicate compositions and undo edits without waiting for After Effects to catch up.\n\nOptimized and accelerated\nInspiration doesn't like to wait. That's why After Effects crunches pixels using multiple processors and has improved support for NVIDIA GPUs. It's a full 64-bit application that uses all the RAM your OS allows, for caches and to render multiple frames simultaneously.\n\n\n\nNew Features in 12.2:\n\n* Auto-save enabled by default\n* file name and location templates, plus automatic creation of folders for image sequences\n* settings migration\n* snapping improvements: shape layers, cameras, and lights\n* option for creating shape layers based on Bezier paths\n* command for converting a parametric shape layer path to a Bezier path\n* new version of OptiX library and new behavior of OptiX library loading and initialization\n* plus many miscellaneous new and changed features and bug fixes, detailed below\n\nLanguages: Deutsch, English, EspaÃƒÂ±ol, FranÃƒÂ§ais, Italiano, Ã¦â€”Â¥Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã¨ÂªÅ¾, Ã­â€¢Å“ÃªÂµÂ­Ã¬â€“Â´\n\n\n\nSystem requirements:\n\n\nIntelÃ‚Â® CoreÃ¢â€žÂ¢2 Duo or AMD PhenomÃ‚Â® II processor; 64-bit support required\nMicrosoftÃ‚Â® WindowsÃ‚Â® 7 with Service Pack 1 (64 bit), Windows 8, or Windows 8 Pro\n4GB of RAM (8GB recommended)\n5GB of available hard-disk space; additional free space required during installation (cannot install on removable flash storage devices)\nAdditional disk space for disk cache (10GB recommended)\n1280x900 display\nOpenGL 2.0Ã¢â‚¬â€œcapable system\nQuickTime 7.6.6 software required for QuickTime features\nOptional: Adobe-certified GPU card for GPU-accelerated ray-traced 3D renderer\nInternet connection and registration are necessary for required software activation, membership validation, and access to online services.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Next open the .rar file by double clicking it.
