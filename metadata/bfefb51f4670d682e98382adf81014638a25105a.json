After one year on continuous improvement in the tools and procedures and many hours of developing, packaging, testing and fixing issues a new stable release is here providing the best that Free and Open Source has to offer with our special green touch: stable, innovative and fun!\nGreen light to freedom!\n\n(In other languages: cs es fr it nl ru ja zh zh-tw)\n\nThis is the first release after the change in the openSUSE development mode, with a much shorter stabilization phase thanks to the extensive testing done in a daily basis in the rolling distribution used now as a base for openSUSE stable releases. The perfect balance between innovation and stability with the great level of freedom of choice that openSUSE users are used to.\n\nopenSUSE 13.2 is:\nInnovative\nBuilt around the most innovative technologies Linux has to offer: Snapper to take the most from snapshots capability of the powerful Btrfs filesystem offered as default option, Wicked to bring light to network configuration, Dracut to ensure shorter boot timesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ For users asking for even more innovation Plasma 5.1, the next generation workspace by KDE, is also available as a technical preview.\n\n \nPolished\nThis version presents the first step to adopt the new openSUSE design guidelines system-wide. The graphical revamp is noticeable everywhere: the installer, the bootloader, the boot sequence and all of the (seven!) supported desktops (KDE, GNOME, Xfce, LXDE, Enlightenment 19, Mate and Awesome). Even the experimental Plasma 5.1 is adapted to the overall experience.\n\n \nEasy\nThe new openSUSE 13.2 installer comes with several changes targeted to make the installation process easier and more welcoming to new users. Those changes include a new and more straightforward installation work flow, better and smarter automatic proposals, less cluttered configuration options and a brand new layout for the user interface. In addition, several tools are included to easy the administration of any system like the Profile Management Tools for AppArmor or the YaST module for Snapper, just to name a few","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfefb51f4670d682e98382adf81014638a25105a","amp;dn":"OpenSUSE+13.2+x64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfefb51f4670d682e98382adf81014638a25105a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,239,181,31,70,112,214,130,233,131,130,173,248,16,20,99,138,37,16,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
