TownsendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision also revealed an ambition to record with different musicians on each album, in order to keep things fresh. May 2009Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ki was one of the more restrained releases in his canon, particularly in comparison to his strident Strapping Young Lad material. It touched on laid-back funk and ambient rock -- as displayed on the tranquil Ã¢â‚¬Å“AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Never Gonna WinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ -- and featured Duris Maxwell, who had previously drummed with Motown act Bobby Taylor and Vancouvers in the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s and Jefferson Airplane in the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ70s.\n\nLater that year, critics found the ProjectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s follow-up album, Addicted, to be reassuringly heavy, and it became one of TownsendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most revered releases. It inventively combined crushing guitars with techno beats and prominently featured the voice of ex-Gathering frontwoman Anneke van Giersbergen.\n\nIn June 2011, both the third and fourth Devin Townsend Project albums were issued on the same day. While Deconstruction continued with TownsendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s traditionally heavy approach and featured a wealth of guest vocalists, Ghost, with its soft, Tangerine Dream-aping soundscapes, was its sonic opposite. The following year brought Epicloud, an unexpected fifth release under the Devin Townsend Project name that brought Giersbergen back into the fold to repeat the crucial role that she played on Addicted.\n\n\nDevin Townsend Project At MySpace\n\n\n\n\n\n2014 Ziltoid 2 (ZÃ‚Â²)\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc 1: The Devin Townsend Project - Sky Blue (Total Length 56:32)\n\n1.

A name recognized around the music world for his various outings with Steve Vai, Strapping Young Lad, The Devin Townsend Band and The Devin Townsend Project. With over 20 studio releases and countless compilations and live albums, DevinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relentless output displays a true volition and passion towards his art. Painting from a palette of many colors, he can write anything from country music (Casualties of Cool) to Pop music (Epicloud) to some of the most extreme and crazy metal ever created (Alien and Deconstruction). One must ask: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Having done so many albums in so many different styles, surely he is going to run out of steam?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ And then ZÃ‚Â² descends from the depths of space.\n\nZÃ‚Â², the highly anticipated sequel to 2007Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ziltoid the Omniscient, is a double album of powerful conflicting energies. On one side, you have The Devin Townsend ProjectsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sky Blue which resonates similarly to releases such as Ocean Machine, Terria and Epicloud. The other, ZiltoidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dark Matters slots alongside the likes of Deconstruction, Infinity and even some of the Strapping Young Lad material.\n\nThe albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history goes as far back as 2009 when Townsend started working on it. Fans have longed for this album ever since the first Ziltoid record and, I can say with absolute confidence, they will not be disappointed in the slightest!\n\nAnneke van Giersbergen, once again, lends her beautiful voice to this double album and she is absolutely flawless: providing a perfect match to Townsend in both melody and power.\n\nThe first disk of the album, Sky Blue, showcases a very sensitive and almost vulnerable side to TownsendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music. While at points it may feel like Epicloud, it has a much more melancholy energy about it. Songs like Fallout, Universal Flame and Warrior carry some of the structure and resonance of Epicloud: massive choruses, pop-laced melodies and danceable beats. Almost contradictory however, songs like Rain City, Forever, A New Reign and The Ones who Love show a yearning and ambience that is sparing in TownsendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s catalogue. Rain City, to me, has the same feeling as The Death of Music on Ocean Machine. The melodies arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t as obvious but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what makes them so beautiful: you have to find them and discover them yourself.\n\nInterestingly, the latter half of the album seems to shift its focus from massive melodies and statements to quieter subtleties (The only exception being Before We Die which features the incredible Universal Choir!)\n\nI had the opportunity to appear in the Universal Choir alongside my sister and her boyfriend. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not hamming this up, but my sister is surprisingly audible in the massive wall of voices! Expertly mixed, you can really hear the depth and power of the choir. It was an absolute joy to be a part of it!\n\nSomething about Sky Blue really resonated with me, as a listener. The melancholy melodies seemed really raw and honest. Townsend has stated that the album is based around the loss of friends and family since it has, sadly, been a theme in his life whilst making the records. Not delving too much into my personal life, but songs like Rain City, Before We Die and Forever have brought me hope at a time where, in my family, there is so much hurt and hopelessness.\n\nThank you so much for Sky Blue, Devin.\n\nEnough of my emotional blubbering Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ We still have to talk about the epic, interstellar, poop-tastic and poozer ridden wonder that is Dark Matters!\n\nI loved the original Ziltoid record: so many original concepts, epic compositions and hilarious commentary! Dark Matters delivers this and so much more!\n\nPresented in a radio show fashion, Dark Matters follows the story of Ziltoid as he tries to save the earth from The War Princess and her vicious army of Poozers! Featuring the vocal talents of Chris Jericho and Dominique Lenore Persi, the dialogue can catch you off guard initially but you quickly lose yourself in the story and the music.\n\nThe composition of the album is second to none: The Universal Choir makes an appearance on the first and last track of the album, there are strings everywhere, word-painted passages of music in true musical-esque fashion and farts and burps! What more could you ask in a metal album?!\n\nIn all seriousness, Dark Matters is a true testament of TownsendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision and talent: a heavy metal musical full of ridiculously hilarious dialogue and it features some of the most intricate, well-composed music he has ever written. To the psychotic chants in War Princess to the thundering pace of The March of the Poozers to the head-banging riffs of Deathray to the high speed force of Ziltoid Goes Home, Townsend has shown himself to be a true composer and a master of his craft!\n\nWritten very much like a musical, the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s themes and motifs evolve throughout the record and reach a euphoric celebration in Dimension Z. This album rivals the very best concept albums in music: the album flows effortlessly; the dialogue doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get in the way of the music and, quite frankly, is the most powerful record Townsend has produced.\n\nWith the performance of the whole ZÃ‚Â² record at the Royal Albert Hall next year, we shall get to see the whole vision that Townsend has planned for this project!\n\nIn his 20 year career, Townsend has constantly changed the boundaries of metal music: removing the superficial masculinity and replacing it with honest, heartfelt and comedic music. In a recent interview with the Independent, Townsend stated that ZÃ‚Â² will define his work Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ I cannot help but agree. Both albums explore every music palette Townsend has drawn from over the years and then taken them to the next level. In my opinion, Sky Blue is the most emotional, heartfelt and raw record Townsend has ever made and Dark Matters? The daftest musical you will ever listen to!\n\n\nIf you like this torrent show some gratitude to site and please make a donation.
