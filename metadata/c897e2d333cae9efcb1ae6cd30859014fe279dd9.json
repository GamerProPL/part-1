With more points of articulation, more polygons in the figures, and male and female specific bases, Genesis 2 allows you to sculpt Victoria 6, and any Genesis 2 3D model figure into more detailed, more articulate and more gender specific forms. Take advantage of all Genesis 2's customization features with this complete head and body morphing bundle.\n\nReference link: http://www.daz3d.com/new-releases/genesis-2-female-morphs-bundle\n\nWhat's included: \n    Genesis 2 Female Head Morphs\n    Genesis 2 Female Body Morphs \n\nThis torrent appears to also include &quot;Victoria 4 for Genesis 2 Female&quot;\n\nDescription: Generation 6, meet Generation 4! Victoria 4 for the Genesis 2 Female, premiere 3D models, gives you a path to use your existing Victoria 4 accessories and textures on your Genesis 2 Female characters. Use the AutoFit clone to access your favorite outfits, the Victoria 4 UV set to use your favorite textures and the Victoria 4 figure shape to see a familiar face.\n\nnote: Due to a limitation in how DAZ Studio handles presets, only material presets which are in DUF format can be directly applied. Any existing material presets must be re-saved in DUF format from the original Victoria 4.\n\nReference link: http://www.daz3d.com/new-releases/victoria-4-for-genesis-2-female\n\nDamn if I know what all this does.  I'm still learning it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c897e2d333cae9efcb1ae6cd30859014fe279dd9","amp;dn":"Daz3D+-+Genesis+2+Female+Morphs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c897e2d333cae9efcb1ae6cd30859014fe279dd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,151,226,211,51,202,233,239,203,26,230,205,48,133,144,20,254,39,157,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
