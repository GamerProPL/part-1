In addition to covering basic programming, these videos give you an idea of how these languages and tools differ from each-other, how they are strong, and how they are weak.\n\nI'd highly recommend these videos to any beginner programmer.\n\nYou can start in any order. Personally, I started with C++ and Qt, and then moved on to other languages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecf384cabbc376a4b754751866184c46b295b0c6","amp;dn":"Programming+Basics+%28C%23%2C+C%2B%2B%2C+Qt%2C+HTML%2C+Java%2C+and+VB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecf384cabbc376a4b754751866184c46b295b0c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,243,132,202,187,195,118,164,183,84,117,24,102,24,76,70,178,149,176,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
