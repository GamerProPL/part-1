Worlds died. And the DC Universe was never the same!\n\nIn 1985, DC Comics dramatically altered comics' original universe with CRISIS ON INFINITE EARTHS, a 12-issue series that rocked the comics community, tragically dooming some of DC's most beloved characters and drastically altering others. Written by Marv Wolfman and pencilled by George PÃƒÂ©rez, with inks by Dick Giordano, Jerry Ordway and Mike DeCarlo, CRISIS ON INFINITE EARTHS finds the alternate worlds that once were a hallmark of the DC Universe under siege by a mysterious force powerful enough to wipe out the lives of billions.\n\nNow this landmark series gets the star treatment in CRISIS ON INFINITE EARTHS: THE ABSOLUTE EDITION Ã¢â‚¬â€ an oversized slipcased set containing two hardcover books. The 368-page Book One includes the full 12-issue maxiseries (which was painstakingly restored and meticulously recolored in 1998), with an introduction by Marv Wolfman, afterword by Dick Giordano, and creator bios. George PÃƒÂ©rez provides all-new art for the dustjacket. (Please note that the Monitor Tapes section from issue #10 will be shot from the original art for this issue and represented in its original form.)\n\nThe 96-page Book Two contains a compendium featuring the full behind-the-scenes story on the years-long making of the maxiseries complete with memos, notes, original plots and commentary from Marv Wolfman and Jerry Ordway; the Official Index to Crisis and Official Index to Crisis Crossovers being reprinted for the very first time, completely updated; a look into post-Crisis events and aftermath stories, how the Superboy/Legion conundrum was solved, and a look at the 20th anniversary of this seminal event. George PÃƒÂ©rez provides all-new art for the dust jacket.\n\nThanks goes to DobisP.R. and Pudgy for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b72b2c923c1f753f167626604c0df2a1d9cda71","amp;dn":"Crisis+on+Infinite+Earths+-+The+Absolute+Edition+%282005%29+%28DobisP.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b72b2c923c1f753f167626604c0df2a1d9cda71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,114,178,201,35,193,247,83,241,103,98,102,4,192,223,42,29,156,218,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
