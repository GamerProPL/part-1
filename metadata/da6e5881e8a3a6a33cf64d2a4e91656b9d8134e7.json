Alexander (Bruno Ganz) lives in his old seaside family home near Thessaloniki, but his daughter and son-in-law plan to sell the house, slightly damaged by an earthquake. Seriously ill, Alexander thinks if he checks himself into the hospital, he'll never check out. Awash in nostalgia, he recalls his late wife, Anna (Isabelle Renauld), seen in flashback, and he lets his daughter read a letter her mother had written to him right after her birth. Alexander's current project involves completing the last unfinished work of a 19th-century poet, but he puts that aside in order to spend time finding a home for his dog. Since his son-in-law won't take the dog, Alexander gives it to his servant. After rescuing an Albanian boy (Achileas Skevis) from a gang that sells children to wealthy Greeks who can't adopt legally, Alexander intends to return the youth to his grandmother in Albania. However, the child lied, and Alexander is unaware the boy has no grandmother. The old man and the boy set forth on a journey, and the other bus passengers include several musicians and the 19th-century poet (Fabrizio Bentivoglio). Bruno Ganz was dubbed into Greek for this Greek-French-Italian co-production..\n\nFile Name .........................................: Eternity and a Day.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,560,201,216 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:07:30\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 656x384 (AR: 1.708)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1430 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.227 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], [GMC]\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0156794/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0156794/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Greek\nSubtitles: English, French, Spanish and Portuguese (srt)\n\nPosted originally at KG by snb, whom we thank","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da6e5881e8a3a6a33cf64d2a4e91656b9d8134e7","amp;dn":"Eternity+and+a+Day+%28Theo+Angelopoulos+1998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da6e5881e8a3a6a33cf64d2a4e91656b9d8134e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,110,88,129,232,163,166,163,60,246,77,42,78,145,101,107,157,129,52,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
