All 6 alternative download.\n\nFiles in Obj (quads), Obj (triangles), Fbx (Maya) and alternate materials.\n\n\nPackages are downloadable separately, so if you already have other packages you don't have to download the whole torrent.\n\n\nIf you have package installers, the file you can extract (materials) have ambient occlusion. The materials you find in the alternate materials have no ambient occlusion.\n\nI mixed those packages with original ones so I have all materials. I don't have time to repack all, just download what you want and put the files in:\n\nusername/my documents/videocopilot/models/\n\n\nHave fun\n\n\nComments are welcome","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5ee54b20f46d3fad841c6c643c273d35119d3b3","amp;dn":"Element+3d+6+Packages+OBJ%2C+FBX+and+MATERIAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5ee54b20f46d3fad841c6c643c273d35119d3b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,238,84,178,15,70,211,250,216,65,198,198,67,194,115,211,81,25,211,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
