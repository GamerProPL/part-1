Various organizations, including\nNATO, use the technologies in the Masters of the World simulator for\neducation and training.\n\nOver one thousand playable actions.At the country's helm, the\nplayer/head of state can act in many areas: budget, taxation (nearly\nthirty types of taxes), currency, economy (over 130 economic\nactivities), foreign and domestic affairs, defense, society, labor,\nhealth, social security, education, environment, transportation,\nculture, and more.\n\nFor each of these areas, numerous laws can be proposed and must be\nvoted on by the Parliament in order to pass. For example: setting\nsocial welfare benefit minimums, changing the retirement age,\ndeveloping atomic weapons in secret, subsidizing the auto industry,\nhiring teachers, defining the powers of unions, setting speed limits\non roads, regulating prostitution, creating an international film\nfestival, etc. he player can also construct elements on the world\nmap, which will change accordingly: nuclear plants, wind farms,\nmilitary bases, pipelines, high-speed train lines, airports, and\nmany more.\n\nEvery action has its consequences. Lobbies, social groups, and leading\nnational and international figures will intervene if their artificial\nintelligence finds it necessary to do so (interviews with the press,\nresignations, protests, strikes, roadblocks, wars...). To prevent\ntension, the player can meet with any figure, or address the media\n(over 8 hours of dialog in the game).\n\nThanks to its intelligence services, the player also has an entire\narsenal of spies and special ops. For example, he or she can - at\nhis or her own risk - reveal scandals about another political party,\ndismantle terrorist networks, sabotage a foreign infrastructure, have\nan opponent assassinated, etc. As the head of the military, the player\ncan move all of his or her units around the map from their actual bases\nduring military conflicts.\n\nInternational organizations (over 50 organizations included) play an\nimportant role. At the UN, for example, the player can denounce a\nnation in order to obtain the Security Council's authorization for\na military intervention. The player can also create his or her own\norganization.Lastly, in order to stay in power, he or she must actively\ncampaign to make sure he or she is elected.\n\nPlayable scenarios\nTwenty or so scenarios are included in the game, such as American\nFiscal Cliff, Israel-Iran Escalation, Organization of Rice\nExporting Countries, European Budgetary Golden Rule, Building\nSouth American Pipelines, African Economic Boom, Third World War,\nTriple A, and Famine in Southern Sudan. .\n\nMultiple integrated options\nMulti country mode to play several countries at the same time\nNetwork multiplayer mode\nGame settings: terrorist activities, natural disaster probabilities,\nreactivity of the people, war triggering\nReal-time online player ranking\n\nIntegration of your own photos, logos, and names to make the game even\nmore realistic\n\nInteractive tutorial and constantly accessible help during the game\n\nHave fun learning geopolitics with the QUIZ mode, which has over 3000\nquestions\n\nWith the Modding Tool extension, an add-on that can be purchased on\nthis website, players can create and share their own geopolitical and\neconomic universes and download other users' creations\n\nText and dialog 100% in English\n\nINSTALL NOTES\n\n2.
