Well-known names covered include Melinda Gebbie, Giovanna Casotto (whose work graces the cover), Tom of Finland and Milo Manara. This provocative title covers the erotic comics explosion in the mid-80s; the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender comics scene; UK and European comics creators since the 70s; and Japanese hentai. The book features an exclusive foreword by Alan Moore, multi-award-winning writer of Watchmen, V for Vendetta and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.\n\nPS I dont see Guido Crepax here for instance and some others, weird for this book...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8260bddc4e5fa11755c4a1ac83da44c22d6dc5b2","amp;dn":"Erotic+Comics+-+A+Graphic+History+Vol+2%2C+from+1970+to+the+presen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8260bddc4e5fa11755c4a1ac83da44c22d6dc5b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,96,189,220,78,95,161,23,85,196,161,172,131,218,68,194,45,109,197,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
