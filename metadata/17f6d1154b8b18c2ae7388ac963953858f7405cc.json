How would you like to \\\\\\&quot;full-close\\\\\\&quot; with a Penthouse Pet of the Year? The answers, my friend, are in Neil Strauss\\\\\\&amp;#039;s entertaining book The Game. Strauss was a self-described chick repellant--complete with large, bumpy nose, small, beady eyes, glasses, balding head, and, worst of all, painful shyness around women. He felt like \\\\\\&quot;half a man.\\\\\\&quot; That is, until a book editor asked him to investigate the community of pickup artists. Strauss\\\\\\&amp;#039;s life was transformed. He spent two years bedding some fine chiquitas and studying with some of the North America\\\\\\&amp;#039;s most suave gents--including the best of them all, the God of the pickup \\\\\\&quot;community,\\\\\\&quot; a man named Mystery.\nMystery is an aspiring Toronto magician who charges $2,250 for a weekend pickup workshop. He is not much to look at: a cross between a vampire and a computer geek. But by using high-powered marketing techniques he\\\\\\&amp;#039;s turned seduction into an effortless craft--even inventing his own vocabulary. His technique sounds like a car salesman\\\\\\&amp;#039;s tip sheet: his main rule is FMAC--find, meet, attract, close. He employs the \\\\\\&quot;three-second rule\\\\\\&quot;--always approach a woman within three seconds of first seeing her in order to avoid getting shy. Other tricks: Intrigue a beautiful woman by pretending to be unaffected by her charm; also, never hit on a woman right away. Start with a disarming, innocent remark, like \\\\\\&quot;Do you think magic spells work?\\\\\\&quot; or \\\\\\&quot;Oh my god, did you see those two girls fighting outside?\\\\\\&quot; And finally, the most important characteristic of the pickup artist--smile.\nAfter two years, Strauss ends up becoming almost as successful as Mystery, but he comes to an important realization. His techniques were actually off-putting to the woman he ended up falling in love with. And they never prepared him for actually having a relationship. After a while, he ran out of one-liners and had to have a real conversation. Still, The Game is a great read that may help some AFCs come out of their shells. --Alex Roslin\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17f6d1154b8b18c2ae7388ac963953858f7405cc","amp;dn":"Niel+Strauss-The+Game-Audiobook%28MP3%29+By+KoolDane+WORKING","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17f6d1154b8b18c2ae7388ac963953858f7405cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,246,209,21,75,139,24,194,174,115,136,172,150,57,83,133,143,116,5,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
