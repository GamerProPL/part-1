Formed in Liverpool in the early 90's, the band's musical vision has continually evolved over the ensuing years while always remaining true to their original goal of creating forward thinking, meaningful, passionate and honest music. With each release they move beyond the boundaries of limited scenes and pigeon holes, creating a complex and emotive atmospheric sound.\n\nCountless world tours have built up a very loyal international fan base and the &quot;Natural Disaster&quot; tour saw them playing hundreds of shows in over 30 countries.\n\nThe line-up is really a collective of two families, who were quite simply born to play music. Anathema consists of brothers Vincent, Daniel and Jamie Cavanagh, alongside childhood friends John Douglas and his sister Lee, who is an incredible singer in her own right. The line-up is completed by Les Smith, who beings much in the way of production expertise to the band. There is a deep bond in the group that transcends usual band politics, ego and avarice. They have a shared vision and are about to take the band to a whole new level. Anathema are currently working on an album of brand new material. A multi coloured, multi layered work of unbridled emotion, passion and intensity, it is set to be an album beyond all expectations!\n\nCBR @ 320kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. The Lost Song part 1\n02.
