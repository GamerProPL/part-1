This means mere mortals like you and us can download a consumer preview of the new offering ahead of the official launch later in the year.\n\nJust because you can, it doesn't mean you should. So weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve downloaded the new suite of applications to find out whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what, to save you the bother. \n\nSkyDrive takes you to the cloud\nRegardless of what new features Word 2013 offers, or how PowerPoint 2013 will make your sales pitches better, the main crux of Office 2013 is taking you in the cloud. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the buzzword at the moment and Microsoft, like Apple and Google, wants you to accept this new way of keeping your files. \n\nNow everything can be stored in the cloud, your documents, presentations and spreadsheets - all ready to be accessed from whatever device you happen to have to hand, be it a tablet, a PC, or your phone.\n\nCentral to that offering is MicrosoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s SkyDrive service. Office saves documents to SkyDrive by default, so your content is always available on all your devices, but unlike Google Docs you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to be online to access them, only to sync them.\n\n\nTHIS WORKS FOR WINDOWS VISTA , 7 , 8 64 BITS.. NO ACTIVATION NEEDED..\nplzz seed..enjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f96b94fcaae4bd54ca075ac83685b9a08fd4b60","amp;dn":"MS+OFFICE+2013+PRO+64+BIT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f96b94fcaae4bd54ca075ac83685b9a08fd4b60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,150,185,79,202,174,75,213,76,160,117,172,131,104,91,154,8,253,75,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
