He s been nominated for five Academy AwardsÃ‚Â®, six Golden GlobesÃ‚Â®, winning for his score for The Painted Veil, and has two GrammyÃ‚Â® nominations. He is best known for his contemplative style that does not attempt to respond on a point-by-point basis to the action onscreen, but rather sets its own complimentary mood. Desplat has composed the scores for many recent blockbusters including &quot;The King's Speech,&quot; &quot;The Queen,&quot; &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,&quot; &quot;The Monuments Men,&quot; &quot;Syriana,&quot; &quot;Zero Dark Thirty,&quot; &quot;Argo,&quot; &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; Parts 1 &amp; 2, &quot;The Girl with the Pearl Earring&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox.&quot;\n\nAbout the Movie\n&quot;The Imitation Game&quot; is based on the real life story of legendary English cryptanalyst and mathematician Alan Turing. The film portrays the nail-biting race against time by Turing and his brilliant team of code-breakers at Britain's top-secret Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, during the darkest days of World War II. Starring Golden GlobeÃ‚Â® nominee and EmmyÃ‚Â® winner Benedict Cumberbatch and OscarÃ‚Â® and Golden GlobeÃ‚Â® nominee Keira Knightley along with Matthew Goode (&quot;The Good Wife,&quot; &quot;Stoker&quot;) and Emmy nominee Charles Dance (&quot;Game of Thrones&quot;),&quot;The Imitation Game&quot; opens in theaters nationwide on November 21, 2014.\n\nsonymasterworks.com \n\n\nSupport the artists you like by buying their music!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:478f05a17b1596a6297c6e8617efc3d406328824","amp;dn":"Alexandre+Desplat+-+The+Imitation+Game+OST+%282014%29+%5Bmp3+320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"478f05a17b1596a6297c6e8617efc3d406328824","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,143,5,161,123,21,150,166,41,124,110,134,23,239,195,212,6,50,136,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
