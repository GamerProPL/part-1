This search is the search for the origins and meaning of life itself.\n\nWe are here, we have life Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what life really is. We can feel our energy, but donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know where this energy comes from and to what goal this energy is going. We are that energy, we have glimpses of its true source and our connection to it, and those glimpses keep us going even when it seems we will never find what we are seeking Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but still we do not know what that energy is.\n\nAn ancient Zen story symbolizes the search for the source of this life. Zen master KakuanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story of The Ten Bulls of Zen is a teaching that uses ten images, each representing a particular step on the journey of experiencing and understanding it means to be a conscious and aware human being.\n\nOsho takes us through this story and its lessons for the traveler on a journey into the inner world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what meditation is all about according to him. But reaching the pure, uncluttered freedom of meditation is not the end. The circle is only complete when the seeker comes back into the marketplace of the world, but as a transformed person.\n\nThis is a book that belongs in the hands of everyone who is on the search, beginning the search, or just thinking about the search.\n\nThe book is illustrated with ten original images of GomizenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ten Bulls of Zen from the Fuzoku Tenri Library, Tenri University, Japan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29499bb72eee19911cd2886aa8722c19a492eebe","amp;dn":"The+Search%2C+Finding+Your+Inner+Power-+Osho+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+PDF%5D+%5BSto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29499bb72eee19911cd2886aa8722c19a492eebe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,73,155,183,46,238,25,145,28,210,136,106,168,114,44,25,164,146,238,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
