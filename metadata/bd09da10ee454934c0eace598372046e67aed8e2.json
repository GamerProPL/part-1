The music is electric Chicago Blues at its finest.\nAmong the sidemen who appear are Little Walter, Walter Horton, Junior Wells, James Cotton, Paul Butterfield, Jimmy Rogers, Mike Bloomfield, Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn, Willie Dixon, Buddy Guy and many others.\nThis music has influenced the previously mentioned artists as well as such people as Stevie Ray Vaughn, Canned Heat, Rory Gallagher, The Allman Brothers Band, Savoy Brown, Jimi Hendrix, and many others. This album, in my own opinion, is the best for us who love blues.\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n--------Disc 1------------\n01 Gypsy Woman\n02 I Can't be Satisfied\n03 I Feel Like Going Home\n04 Train Fare Home Blues\n05 Mean Red Spider\n06 Standin' Here Treblin'\n07 You Gonna Need My Help\n08 Little Geneva\n09 Rollin &amp; Tumblin' Part 1\n10 Rollin' Stone\n11 Walkin' Blues\n12 Louisiana Blues\n13 Long Distance\n14 Honey Bee\n15 Country Boy\n16 She Moves me\n17 Still A Fool\n18 Stuff You Gotta Watch\n19 Who's Gonna Be your Man Woman\n20 Standing Around Crying\n21 Baby Please Don't Go\n22 I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man\n23 I Just Want To Make Love To You\n24 I'm Ready\n25 Young Fashioned Ways\n26 I Want To Be Loved\n\n----------Disc 2----------------\n01 My Eyes (Keep Me In Trouble)\n02 Mannish Boy\n03 Sugar Sweet\n04 Trouble No More\n05 Forty Days and Forty Nights\n06 Just To Be With You\n07 Don't Go No Farther\n08 Diamond At Your Feet\n09 I Love My Life I Live, I Live\n10 Got My Mojo Working\n11 Rock Me\n12 Look What You've Done\n13 She's Nineteen Years Old\n14 Close To You\n15 Walkin Thru The Park\n16 Take The Bitter With The Sweet\n17 I Feel So Good\n18 You Shook Me\n19 My home Is In The Delta\n20 Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\n21 The Same Thing\n22 You Can't Lose What You Aint You Never Had\n23 All Aboard (Fathers And Sons)\n24 Can't Get No Grindin'\n\nMuzik62","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd09da10ee454934c0eace598372046e67aed8e2","amp;dn":"Muddy+Waters+-+The+Anthology+2cd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd09da10ee454934c0eace598372046e67aed8e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,9,218,16,238,69,73,52,192,234,206,89,131,114,4,110,103,174,216,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
