Fixed, and debugged\n\n\n19-year old man died in USA from heart attack, while he was playing this game.\n\nParsec Production/Blue Isle Studios\n2013\nPC\n4.1.0.67110\n\n\nWindows XP, Vista, Windows 7\nIntel Core 2 Duo 2200 MHz\n2 Gb RAM\nGeForce GT400 \n1500 Mb\n\nThe majority of the game takes place in abandoned areas (house, defunct mine, etc.), each with different objectives. Slender: The Arrival uses similar mechanics to its predecessor, The Eight Pages. The character is armed only with a flashlight. This limited defense forces a sense of helplessness, as the best way to survive in the game is to run whenever in danger.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bd44fd80fb19b09c7593e988bc78ea1efb92960","amp;dn":"Slender%3A+The+Arrival+v+4.2+%282013%29+PC+ENG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bd44fd80fb19b09c7593e988bc78ea1efb92960","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,212,79,216,15,177,155,9,199,89,62,152,139,199,142,161,239,185,41,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
