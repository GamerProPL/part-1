They are often the root causes of a host of avoidable health problemsâ€”from indigestion, ulcers, and constipation to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. On the other hand, complex carbohydrates like whole grains, legumes, tubers, and other starches provide your body with essential proteins and nutrients that satisfy the appetite while simultaneously fighting illness. But Americans eat far too few calories from carbohydratesâ€”only about forty percent, according to Dr. John McDougall, internationally renowned expert on nutrition and health, featured on the documentary Forks Over Knives.\r\n\r\nThe Healthiest Diet on the Planet helps us reclaim our health by enjoying nutritious starches, vegetables, and fruits. McDougall takes on the propaganda machines pushing dangerous, high-fat fad diets and cuts through the smoke and mirrors of the diet industry. He offers a clear, proven guide to what we should and shouldnâ€™t eat to prevent disease, slow the aging process, improve our physical fitness, be kind to the environment, and be our most attractive selves.\r\n\r\nFeaturing two dozen color photos and mouth-watering, easy-to-follow recipes for buckwheat pancakes, breakfast tortillas, baked potato skins, rainbow risotto, red lentil soup, green enchiladas, dairy-free lasagna and pizza, and more, The Healthiest Diet on the Planet will help you look great, feel better, and forever change the way you think about health and nutrition","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb310e51c271ed4328fadd3f44ab73b59564e1ac","amp;dn":"John+McDougall+-+The+Healthiest+Diet+on+the+Planet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb310e51c271ed4328fadd3f44ab73b59564e1ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,49,14,81,194,113,237,67,40,250,221,63,68,171,115,181,149,100,225,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
