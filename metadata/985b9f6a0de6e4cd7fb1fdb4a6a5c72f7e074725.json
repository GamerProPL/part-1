Dark creatures from beyond the world are on the loose, and it will take everything our narrator has just to stay alive: there is primal horror here, and menace unleashed - within his family and from the forces that have gathered to destroy it.\n\nHis only defense is three women, on a farm at the end of the lane. The youngest of them claims that her duckpond is ocean. The oldest can remember the Big Bang.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:985b9f6a0de6e4cd7fb1fdb4a6a5c72f7e074725","amp;dn":"Neil+Gaiman+-+The+Ocean+at+the+End+of+the+Lane+%28epub%2C+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"985b9f6a0de6e4cd7fb1fdb4a6a5c72f7e074725","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,91,159,106,13,230,228,205,127,177,253,180,166,165,199,47,126,7,71,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
