Join Keith Barker and Anthony Sequeira as they guide you through the latest and current R&amp;S technologies. This course is the first of six courses that make up the entire curriculum. These six courses follow the official blueprint perfectly.\n\nRecommended skills:\nAlthough not required, it is recommended that a person preparing for the CCIE in Routing and Switching already have the skills and knowledge addressed in the Cisco CCNA and CCNP for R/S.

The CCIE certifies the skills required of network engineers to plan, operate and troubleshoot complex, converged network infrastructures on a wide variety of Cisco equipment.\n\nThe CCIE is one of the most prestigious networking certification in the industry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56c7feedc0ec28c6b6dd50320590bd47fbcf5024","amp;dn":"CBT+Nuggets+-+CCIE+R%26amp%3BS+v5+All-In-One+-+1.0+Network+Principle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56c7feedc0ec28c6b6dd50320590bd47fbcf5024","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,199,254,237,192,236,40,198,182,221,80,50,5,144,189,71,251,207,80,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
