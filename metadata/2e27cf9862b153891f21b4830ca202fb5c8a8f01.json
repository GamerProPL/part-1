They resist reforms sought by Pope Francis and seek to delegitimize their opponents, to isolate those who want to eliminate corruption. Itâ€™s a war that will determine the future of the church. And if he loses the battle against secular interests and blackmail, Pope Francis could resign, much like his predecessor.\r\n\r\nBased on confidential informationâ€•including top secret documents from inside the Vatican, and actual transcripts of Pope Francisâ€™s admonishments to the papal court about the lack of financial oversight and responsibilityâ€•Merchants in the Temple illustrates all the undercover work conducted by the Pope since his election and shows the reader who his real enemies are. It reveals the instruments Francis is using to reform the Vatican and rid it, once and for all, of the overwhelming corruption traditionally encrusted in the Roman Catholic Church","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e27cf9862b153891f21b4830ca202fb5c8a8f01","amp;dn":"Merchants+in+the+Temple%3A+Inside+Pope+Francis%27s+Secret+Battle+...","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e27cf9862b153891f21b4830ca202fb5c8a8f01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,39,207,152,98,177,83,137,31,33,180,131,12,162,2,251,92,138,143,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
