An artistic genius, raised on a tree farm in Indiana by a callous father, Rich wrestled all of his life with the brokenness and crippling insecurity born of his childhood. A lover of Jesus and a rebel in the church, Rich refused to let his struggles with his own darkness tear him away from a God he was determined to love. As he struggled with success in Nashville and depression in Wichita, Rich desired most of all to live a life of honest and reckless faith amidst a culture of religion and conformity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13e1690030a81e35a04dd9b92dc360945ac67ceb","amp;dn":"Ragamuffin+%282014%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13e1690030a81e35a04dd9b92dc360945ac67ceb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,225,105,0,48,168,30,53,160,77,217,185,45,195,96,148,90,198,124,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
