For Smiley, they're iconic. It's like Bond's Aston Martin or vodka martini.&quot; Oldman tried on hundreds of glasses frames before he found the appropriate spectacles.\n\nThe filmmakers searched for 18 months to find the right actor to play George Smiley. They were on the point of canceling the film before producer Tim Bevan thought of Gary Oldman for Smiley. \n\nGary Oldman was offered a gray-haired wig to wear for his role, but declined it in favour of bleaching his hair for a more natural hairdo for a middle-aged persona like Smiley. \n\nThe film took six months to edit. \n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/bUg8l.png[/IMG]\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/0Vu94.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\ntorrent name\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/txr1O.png[/IMG]\n\nTinker Tailor Soldier Spy 2011 720p BRrip_scOrp_sujaidr\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/nZdCe.png[/IMG]\n\n\n[iMDB]:           [ 7.7 /10 | 9,180 votes | Top 250 #none\n[AWARDS]:         [ 5 wins &amp; 21 nominations\n[GENRE]:          [ Crime | Drama | Thriller\n[FORMAT]:         [ Matroska\n[FILE SIZE]:      [ 799 MiB\n[NO OF CDs]:      [ 1\n[RESOLUTION]:     [ 1280*544\n[ASPECT RATIO]:   [ 2.35:1\n[FRAME RATE]:     [ 23.976 fps\n[LANGUAGE ]:      [ English\n[SUBTITLES]:            [ hardcoded for foreign parts + muxed for english parts\n[ORIGINAL RUNTIME]:     [ 02:07:00\n[RELEASE RUNTIME]:      [ 02:07:00\n[SOURCE]:               [ 720p.infamous\n\nSAMPLE                  :INCLUDED\n\nthanks to the awesome scorp(the best ripper)\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/jHcjQ.png[/IMG]\nuploader\n sujaidr\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/UzVN6.png[/IMG]\n\nPLOT: In the early 1970s during the Cold War, the head of British Intelligence, Control, resigns after an operation in Budapest, Hungary goes badly wrong. It transpires that Control believed one of four senior figures in the service was in fact a Russian agent - a mole - and the Hungary operation was an attempt to identify which of them it was. Smiley had been forced into retirement by the departure of Control, but is asked by a senior government figure to investigate a story told to him by a rogue agent, Ricky Tarr, that there was a mole. Smiley considers that the failure of the Hungary operation and the continuing success of Operation Witchcraft (an apparent source of significant Soviet intelligence) confirms this, and takes up the task of finding him. Through the efforts of Peter Guillam, Smiley obtains information that eventually leads him to Jim Prideaux, the agent at the heart of the Hungary fiasco...\nDirector: Tomas Alfredson\nStars:             Gary Oldman, Colin Firth and Tom Hardy\nimdb: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1340800/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1340800/&lt;/a&gt;  \n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/7liX3.png[/IMG]\n\nscreenshots\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/TqEC3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/TqEC3.jpg&lt;/a&gt;                \n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/m2Nmq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/m2Nmq.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/kn01l.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/kn01l.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/dEeGD.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/dEeGD.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/wF4BC.png[/IMG]\n\n                                        TO VISIT MY facebook page to post requests GOOGLE SUJAIDR \n\n\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/FkbPX.gif[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:343bd9ba2c9e1e540044abd6b88898689a3bb0fc","amp;dn":"Tinker+Tailor+Soldier+Spy+2011+720p+BRrip_scOrp_sujaidr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"343bd9ba2c9e1e540044abd6b88898689a3bb0fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,59,217,186,44,158,30,84,0,68,171,214,184,136,152,104,154,59,176,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
