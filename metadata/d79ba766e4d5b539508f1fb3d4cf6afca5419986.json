I watched everything I put in my mouth and my eating schedule displayed Swiss-precision timing. I would never eat the foods I loved Ã¢â‚¬â€ like the cherry turnover above Ã¢â‚¬â€ and I never dared miss a feeding, fearing the rumble, irritability and nausea of an empty stomach. In shortÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nOn top of that, I trained for hours a day and I never looked anything like I do now.\n\nThese days, I only get to the gym three times a week if IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m lucky. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m building a business and working with athletes across the globe. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have time to spare.\n\nBut I found a way to look awesome anyway.\n\nMy background as a physicist keeps me hungry for knowledge. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m always reading a medical journal to stay on top of my game and while researching a random vein of interestÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nI stumbled upon an integral component of the way to stay lean and enhance every aspect of training Ã¢â‚¬â€ strength, size, aesthetics Ã¢â‚¬â€ with almost no effort.\n\nI donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t eat on a schedule anymore. I make gains in the gym with little effort, even training a total of 3 hours a week; I eat cherry turnovers, hamburgers and fries, ice cream and cheesecake and guess what?\n\nAfter spending a few years perfecting the eating strategy, I finally put it all into a single book with everything you need to live like you want, enjoy life and look like a fitness model all year, while still achieving new goals in the gym.\n\nAnd thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s it. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all I have to tell you. Everything you could want is in the book. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one of the most heavily researched and referenced diet books in the world, bar none. My only goal for this book is to help people learn my supposed secret:\n\nYou can read on if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like and see testimonials from world-record holding powerlifters, internationally ranked female athletes, the editor of MenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fitness Magazine and even the average person who just wanted to look awesome naked. But if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re ready to make your friends envious, to make life simple and reveal the chiseled comic-book-character physique thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hiding under a layer of fat, then why wait?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d79ba766e4d5b539508f1fb3d4cf6afca5419986","amp;dn":"Carb+Back+Loading+Ebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d79ba766e4d5b539508f1fb3d4cf6afca5419986","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,155,167,102,228,213,181,57,80,143,31,179,212,207,106,252,165,65,153,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
