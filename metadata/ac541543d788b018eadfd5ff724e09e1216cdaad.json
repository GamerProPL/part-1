An epic film in its production, scope and revelations, Utopia reveals that apartheid is deep within Australia's past and present and that Aboriginal people are still living in abject poverty and Third World conditions, with a low life expectancy and disproportionately high rate of deaths in police custody.\nStarting his career as a journalist in his native Australia before moving to London, John Pilger has been the recipient of multiple awards, including Britain's highest award for journalism, twice, and television academy awards in both the UK and the United States. He has been a foreign correspondent and frontline war reporter, and is a regular contributor to international media, including the ITV Network, the Guardian and the New Statesman. An incisive and rare critic of Western economic and military power, Pilger's humane eyewitness reporting has been described as a unique presence on British television that explores where others dare not go.\n\n\n=================== What's In This Torrent ===================\n\n\n\n\nUtopia (1h 50mn) \n\n\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name : Utopia.avi\nFormat : AVI\nFormat info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 1.09 GB\nDuration (ms) : 1h 50mn\nTotal bitrate : 1 422 Kbps\nEncoded application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n===================== Video =====================\nId : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP : 1\nFormat settings - QPel : No\nFormat settings - GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix : Custom\nCodec Id : XVID\nCodec : XviD\nDuration (ms) : 1h 50mn\nBitrate : 1 159 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio : 1.731\nFramerate : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry : YUV\nColos space : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.155\nStream size : 912 MB (81%)\nEncoded library : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n===================== Audio =====================\nId : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 2\nCodec Id : 50\nDuration (ms) : 1h 50mn\nBitrate mode : Constant\nBitrate : 256 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String : Lossy\nStream size : 202 MB (18%)\nAlignement : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration : 80 ms (2.00 video frames)\nInterleave preload : 504 ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac541543d788b018eadfd5ff724e09e1216cdaad","amp;dn":"Utopia+-+John+Pilger+-+Documentary+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac541543d788b018eadfd5ff724e09e1216cdaad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,84,21,67,215,136,176,24,234,223,213,255,114,78,9,225,33,108,218,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
