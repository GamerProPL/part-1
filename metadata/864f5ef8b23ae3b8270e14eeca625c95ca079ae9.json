Luckily, the coded message came from a friendly alien race that fathered and protected us over the years. And now they are giving us the tools to fight back (in the form of power armor). But the delivery service takes a long time, and during those loooong decades waiting for that cargo ship to arrive with their one power suit, they choose a champion of earth to train to wear the suit and defend the earth! Then the ship finally arrives... Only to get shot down by 4 morons who play with the suit and ultimately get one piece each stuck to them. Now they need to work with the government to train these 4 morons with individual pieces attached to them. Will they save the day or will they stand around contemplating life?                \r\n\r\nYear: 2015                \r\nDirector: Matt Hullum                \r\nWriters: Burnie Burns, Chris Demarais, Josh Flanagan, Matt Hullum                \r\nStars: Burnie Burns, Gavin Free, Michael Jones, Colton Dunn, Alexandria DeBerry, Alan Ritchson, Steve Shearer, Kirk C.
