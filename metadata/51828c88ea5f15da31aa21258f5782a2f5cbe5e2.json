The central premise is that there are a series of parrallel Uiverses that are just one small step away from each other. Each of these Universes are a carbon copy of ours but with variations. A device known as a Stepper allows travel between these places. A few individuals have a natural ability to step without the need for any device.\r\n\r\nThe one major difference is that our Earth (Known as Datum Earth) is the only one that is inhabited by humanity - specifically Homo sapiens. The novels follow the events following Step Day after these parallel Universes are first discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Long Earth\r\nThe Long War\r\nThe Long Mars\r\nThe Long Utopia\r\nThe Long Cosmos\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Michael Fenton-Stevens\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51828c88ea5f15da31aa21258f5782a2f5cbe5e2","amp;dn":"Terry+Pratchett+-+The+Long+Earth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51828c88ea5f15da31aa21258f5782a2f5cbe5e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,130,140,136,234,95,21,218,49,170,33,37,143,87,130,162,245,203,229,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
