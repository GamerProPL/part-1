The owner of the trailer - a young drug addict - is unaccounted for, prompting police to wonder whether the body found at the scene is hers. Suspicion falls on a local neighbourhood watch scheme, and eager for the investigation to yield results, police supervisor Klas FredÃ©n recruits the charismatic Norwegian homicide investigator Steinar Hovland to head up the inquiry.
