His casual Malibu lifestyle is interrupted when his tightly wound brother Alan, who's facing a divorce, and his son Jake, come to live with him. Together, these two and a half men confront the challenges of growing up; finally. Complicating matters are the brothers' self-obsessed, controlling mother, Evelyn, Alan's estranged wife, Judith and Charlie's crazy neighbor Rose, who wants to be a part of his life and is willing to do anything to be around. After the death of his brother, Alan Harper meets and befriends a lonely young man named Walden Schmidt who turns out to be a billionaire. Unable to afford his brother's home, Alan sells Walden the house, and as a way of showing his gratitude, Walden allows Alan and his son Jake to move in with him.\n\nRating - 8.5\nAired on CBS\n\nTwo and a Half Men S11E01 HDTV x264-LOL\n\nEpisode Title: Nangnangnangnang\nOriginal Airdate: Thursday, September 26, 2013 \n\nCharlie's 25-year-old daughter arrives at the beach house, hoping to get to know her family.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/740/jnif.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/740/jnif.jpg&lt;/a&gt; http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/4523/tva4.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a70b27a64df44dc59eac92b79eedb48bccabced0","amp;dn":"Two+and+a+Half+Men+S11E01+HDTV+x264-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a70b27a64df44dc59eac92b79eedb48bccabced0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,11,39,166,77,244,77,197,158,172,146,183,158,237,180,139,204,171,206,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
