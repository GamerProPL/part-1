This allows you to quickly see what applications are communicating over the network and the Internet, how much bandwidth they are using, and what hosts they are connecting to. GlassWire also maintains a database of suspicious sites and will alert you when you attempt to visit one of them. Last, but not least, GlassWire includes an easy to use application firewall that allows you to block specific applications from communicating over a network and the Internet.\n\nWhen testing GlassWire, we found that the tool was very easy to use. Simply install it and leave it running in the background to start logging all sorts of information about your processes and their network activity. You can then use GlassWire to review this information and decide if you wish to allow these applications to continue being able to connect to the Internet. Another useful feature is the ability to quickly spot unknown programs that are using the Internet. Most malware programs tend to send data over the Internet and by using a program like GlassWire you can quickly spot these suspicious programs even before your anti-virus has it in their malware definitions. \n\n \n\nNetwork Monitor \n\nGlassWireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s network monitor visualizes your current and past network activity by traffic type, application, geographic location, all on a beautiful and easy to understand graph. Go back in time up to 30 days and see what your computer or server was doing in the past. Click the graph to see details of what app or network event caused a spike in network activity. \nFirewall \n\nGlassWireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s firewall reveals all your network activity so you can easily see what your computer is doing in the background. GlassWireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s firewall shows you what current and past servers your computer is communicating with so you can see potential threats and block them if necessary. \n\nInstructions: \n\n1.
