Good combination of Folk,Psychadelic and Rock. Although called Space Oddity after the first track on the album also Bowie's first hit single the album itself is far from being Spacey or strange. bowie obviously was very influenced by Dylan and others and he probably showed more his influence then himself on the album and perhaps that's the reason why so many music critics have overlooked Space Oddity ( originally titled Man of Sound or music or whatever). This album is by no means a masterpiece but it is good nevertheless.My personal favorites on here are &quot;Space Oddity,&quot; &quot;Cygnet Committee,&quot; &quot;An Occasional Dream,&quot; &quot;Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud,&quot; and &quot;Memory of a Free Festival,&quot; especially &quot;Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud!&quot; I love that song and I always play it around three times until I move on to &quot;God Knows I'm Good.&quot; Man, that would be so cool if he'd do just one more folk/glam rock album. I really like the newer stuff he's done, but nothing beats folk and glam.\n\n \ntracks\n\n1.&quot;Space Oddity&quot; \n2.&quot;Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed&quot; \n3.&quot;(Don't Sit Down)&quot; * \n4.&quot;Letter to Hermione&quot; \n5.&quot;Cygnet Committee&quot; \n6.&quot;Janine&quot; \n7.&quot;An Occasional Dream&quot; \n8.&quot;Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud&quot; \n9.&quot;God Knows I'm Good&quot; \n10.&quot;Memory of a Free Festival\n11.&quot;Conversation Piece&quot; (1970 B-side of &quot;The Prettiest Star&quot;) \n12.&quot;Memory of a Free Festival Part 1&quot; (1970 single version A-side) \n13.&quot;Memory of a Free Festival Part 2&quot; (1970 single version B-side)\n\ntracks 11-12-13 are bonus tracks from the 1990 re-issue but i put them on anyway \n\n!* &quot;(Don't Sit Down)&quot; was deleted from the album when it was rereleased in 1972.\n\n\nThank you for seeding :0)\n\nwatch original video for space oddity here &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://vodpod.com/watch/165488-david-bowie-space-oddity-original-video-1969&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://vodpod.com/watch/165488-david-bowie-space-oddity-original-video-1969&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:248c1607fcebf711acf9a26ad170a09be70826fc","amp;dn":"David+Bowie+space+oddity+1969","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"248c1607fcebf711acf9a26ad170a09be70826fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,140,22,7,252,235,247,17,172,249,162,106,209,112,160,155,231,8,38,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
