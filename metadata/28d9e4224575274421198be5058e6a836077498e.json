The text made the subject matter accessible to a wide range of readers, but with a solid historical context. The photography was exceptionally good and clearly showed the detail of ancient artifacts and hard to find black-and-white excavation photographs from the early 20th century. Overall I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the book.&quot;\n\nB.G.
