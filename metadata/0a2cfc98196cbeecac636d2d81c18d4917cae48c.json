Written by a man who changed the history of philosophy himself, this is an account that has never been rivaled since its first publication over sixty years ago.\n\nSince its first publication in 1945, Lord RussellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s A History of Western Philosophy is still unparalleled in its comprehensiveness, its clarity, its erudition, its grace, and its wit. In seventy-six chapters he traces philosophy from the rise of Greek civilization to the emergence of logical analysis in the twentieth century. \n\nAmong the philosophers considered are: Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, the Atomists, Protagoras, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, the Cynics, the Sceptics, the Epicureans, the Stoics, Plotinus, Ambrose, Jerome, Augustine, Benedict, Gregory the Great, John the Scot, Aquinas, Duns Scotus, William of Occam, Machiavelli, Erasmus, More, Bacon, Hobbes, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, the Utilitarians, Marx, Bergson, James, Dewey, and lastly the philosophers with whom Lord Russell himself is most closely associatedÃ¢â‚¬â€Cantor, Frege, and Whitehead, coauthor with Russell of the monumental Principia Mathematica.&quot;\n\nThis is one of the great, engaging works of philosophy from the mid-20th century. A clear and thorough history of the subject by a great master himself.\n\nFor more information on this work and its considerable impact, please see the wikilink here.\n\n&quot;A precious book ... a work that is in the highest degree pedagogical which stands above the conflicts of parties and opinions.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Albert Einstein\n\nThe torrent folder contains the original retail quality PDF as well as conversions into MOBI, LIT, AZW3 and EPUB formats done in Calibre.
