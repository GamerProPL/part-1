But Based on a True Story is much more than a memoir; itâ€™s the hilarious, inspired epic of Normâ€™s life.\r\n\r\nIn dispatches from a road trip to Las Vegas (part of a plan hatched to regain the fortune heâ€™d lost to sports betting and other vices) with his sidekick and enabler, Adam Eget, Norm recounts the milestone moments, the regrets, the love affairs, the times fortune smiled on his life, and the times it refused to smile. As the clock ticks down, Normâ€™s debt reaches record heights, and he must find a way to evade the hefty price thatâ€™s been placed on his head by one of the most dangerous loan sharks in the country.\r\n\r\nAs a comedy legend should, Norm peppers these pages with classic jokes and fondly mythologized Hollywood stories. This wildly adventurous, totally original, and absurdly funny saga turns the conventional â€œcomicâ€™s memoirâ€ on its head and gives the reader an exclusive pass into the mad, glorious mind of Norm Macdonald","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd9fb227df8141cb0457302c25087969e7d8a6da","amp;dn":"Based+on+a+True+Story%3A+A+Memoir+%282016%29+by+Norm+Macdonald","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd9fb227df8141cb0457302c25087969e7d8a6da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,159,178,39,223,129,65,203,4,87,48,44,37,8,121,105,231,216,166,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
