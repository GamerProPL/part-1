Music Theory for Computer Musicians explains these music theory fundamentals in the most simple and accessible way possible. Concepts are taught using the MIDI keyboard environment and today's computer composing and recording software. By reading this book and following the exercises contained within it, you, the aspiring music producer/computer musician, will find yourself making great progress toward understanding and using these fundamentals of the music language. The result will be a great improvement in your ability to write and produce your own original music!\n\nPDF Format\n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6d7541385c07dc7bf818e7294ea3a8648abf980","amp;dn":"Music+Theory+for+COmputer+Musicians+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6d7541385c07dc7bf818e7294ea3a8648abf980","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,215,84,19,133,192,125,199,191,129,142,114,148,234,58,134,72,171,249,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
