Persico, that tells the story of the Nuremberg Trials.\n\nPart one\n\nAt the close of World War II, Hermann GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ring surrenders to the Americans and enjoys the hospitality of a U.S. Air Force base. Samuel Rosenman, acting on the orders of U.S. President Harry S. Truman, recruits Justice Robert H. Jackson to prepare a war crimes tribunal against GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ring and the surviving Nazi leadership. GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ring, Albert Speer and others are arrested for war crimes and imprisoned in a U.S. Army stockade in Bad Mondorf. Jackson, his assistant Elsie Douglas, and his prosecution team fly to Europe. Psychologist Gustave Gilbert arrives at the stockade with prisoner Hans Frank, who has attempted suicide.\n\n\nJackson negotiates with Allied representatives Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, General Iona Nikitchenko and Henri Donnedieu de Vabres to ensure a unified prosecution. Jackson selects the Nuremberg Palace of Justice for the site of the trials and reconstruction work commences. GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ring and the others are stripped of their rank and transferred to the prison in Nuremberg where they come into conflict with the guards under the command of the strict Colonel Burton C. Andrus. Major Airey Neave serves GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ring, Speer and the other with their indictments. U.S. judge Francis Biddle arrives to take control of the court but reluctantly passes the honour at JacksonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s insistence. Following the suicide of prisoner Robert Ley, round-the-clock watches are posted and Gilbert is appointed prisoner liaison.\n\n\nSir Geoffrey Lawrence opens the trial with all defendants pleading not guilty and Jackson gives a stirring opening statement. At lunch a jovial GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ring holds court over the other defendants while Speer begins to show signs of repentance. Maxwell-Fyfe puts forward an emotive eyewitness account of the massacre of Jews while Jackson reads out dry documentation. As the court begins to tire of JacksonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s meticulous approach, Maxwell-Fyfe urges pushing on to the witness interviews, which reveal the horrors of the concentration camps. The court is shaken by documentary footage of the camps.\n\nPart two\n\nSpeer explains GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ringÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dominance to Gilbert and insists that his control over the others must be broken. GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ring takes the stand and begins speaking to the German people. Jackson, at GilbertÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s suggestion, has GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ring isolated. Under cross-examination, GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ring outmanoeuvers and humiliates Jackson, who later accuses Biddle of giving GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ring free rein in court. Douglas talks Jackson out of tendering his resignation, and the two share a kiss. Under advice from Maxwell-Fyfe, Jackson returns to confront GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ring with evidence of his crimes against the Jews and successfully dismisses the defendantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s denials.\n\n\nAt a Christmas party, the housekeeper refuses to serve the Russians, but Douglas rescues the situation before slipping away with Jackson. Gilbert visits the defendants and, under JacksonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s advice, attempts to convince them to take responsibility for their crimes. Andrus relaxes the prison rules for Christmas, and GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ring shares a friendly drink with his guard, Lt. Tex Wheelis. The cross-examination of the defendants intensifies and the defence calls Rudolf HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸, who casually reveals the horrors of Auschwitz. Speer is implicated in the enslavement of foreign workers by fellow defendant Fritz Sauckel and in response accepts collective responsibility for the crimes of the Nazi regime.\n\n\nGilbert interviews GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ringÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wife and she reveals HitlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s orders to have them all executed, which that led to the familyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s surrender. Jackson is moved by GilbertÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s summation of his examinations that the NaziÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s main evil was a complete lack of empathy, to give an impassioned closing statement. Goring uses his final statement to condemn the trial, and is sentenced along with 10 others to death by hanging. Speer uses his final statement to commend the tribunal and is given 20 years in prison. GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ring commits suicide after his request to be executed by firing squad is denied. Andrus presides over the executions of the others while Jackson and Douglas head home.\n\n\nCast\n\n    * Alec Baldwin as Supreme Court Justice Robert H.
