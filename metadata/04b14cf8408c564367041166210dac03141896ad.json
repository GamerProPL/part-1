Create ideas, make changes without stopping, and capture everything as you work. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve used music software before, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re already familiar with one half of Ableton Live. LiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Arrangement View is a familiar working space: time moves from left to right, while tracks are stacked vertically. But Live also features the revolutionary Session View: a unique sketchpad for improvising, playing and performing with musical ideas, without the constraints of the timeline. Freely and independently start and stop any number of audio or MIDI loops - everything stays in sync. Almost everything in Live works in real-time - add, reorder or remove devices, play with LiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flexible track routing and more - all without interrupting your creative flow.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n9.1.6 Release Notes\n\nImprovements and feature changes:\n\nImproved graphics for Retina displays. Note that this requires a Mac with OS X 10.7.4 Ã¢â‚¬Å“LionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or higher.\nAdded native full screen support for Mac OS X. Note that this requires 10.9 Mavericks or higher and having the option &quot;Displays have separate Spaces&quot; enabled in OS X' Mission Control system preferences (this is the system's default). The keyboard shortcut for toggling full-screen mode has been changed accordingly to CTRL+CMD+F, which is the operating systemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s default. Users with older OS X versions and Windows users are not affected by this change.\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now possible to export selected tracks by choosing Ã¢â‚¬ËœSelected Tracks OnlyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in the Ã¢â‚¬ËœExport Audio / VideoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ dialogue box. The option Ã¢â‚¬ËœIndividual TracksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is still available as well, but has been renamed to Ã¢â‚¬ËœAll Individual TracksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\nImproved Max application chooser in LiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœFile Folder' preferences pane to be compatible with the folder structure of Max 7 application bundles.\nUpdated info texts and manuals.\n\nBugfixes:\n\nFixed a bug that could cause memory leaks and an unusually high CPU load when running Live as a ReWire slave on Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite.\nSome chooser controls would clip the right side of an active entry when closed, e.g. the Auto FilterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœShapeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ chooser would cut off the rightmost line of the square or saw icon.\nClicking on a certain area at the bottom of a track volume slider in LiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mixer would sometimes cause the slider to move to an unwanted position.\nChanging the screen resolution while running Live in full-screen mode would not reset LiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s window to the correct size and still show the windowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title bar. This is now fixed.\nFixed a crash that could occur under certain conditions when loading Live sets containing a large amount of VST plug-ins and Max for Live devices.\nFixed a crash that could occur when hovering over an automation breakpoint or segment on the first automation lane of an Arrangement track and then forcing another automation to be shown on the same lane, e.g. by tweaking a different parameter using a MIDI controller.\nMax for Live devices would not pass an Ã¢â‚¬Å“All Notes OffÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ message to the subsequent devices in a device chain when the Max for Live device was turned off.\nVST plug-ins that have a MIDI output would not be able to output a CC 123 MIDI message (&quot;All Notes Off&quot;).\nMax for Live MIDI effect devices would not be correctly latency-compensated when the device was turned off and the device had an additional latency defined in its patcher inspector.\nThe Ã¢â‚¬Å“Session ZoomÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ feature, which allows to move LiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Session ring by multiple tracks / scenes at once with certain MIDI control surfaces would stop working under certain conditions.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstall:\n\n-Turn off the internet connection.\n\n-Drag Ableton Live 9 Suite.app into Applications Folder.\n\n-Open Ableton Live 9 Suite.app from Applications folder.\n\n-Choose Authorize later.\n\n-Ableton starts creating the Core Library.\n\n-In Ableton (Preferences - Licenses Maintenance) that gives the option to automatically check for Updates and to automatically send usage data. Turn both options off.\n\n-Close Ableton.\n\n-Patch Live: Double-click on the Patch.command file. When Terminal ask for password enter your OS X password and wait until the window show the message Ã¢â‚¬Å“Process completedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\n-Authorize Live: Double-click on the Authorize.auz file and open with 9.1.6 version.\n\nEnjoy!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1337x.to - demonoid.ph - fenopy.se - flashtorrents.org\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (11)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04b14cf8408c564367041166210dac03141896ad","amp;dn":"Ableton+Live+9+Suite+v9.1.6+x86+%2B+Patch+OS+X+%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04b14cf8408c564367041166210dac03141896ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,177,76,248,64,140,86,67,103,4,17,102,33,13,172,3,20,24,150,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
