Distinct from both the stoned volk of their earliest recordings and the Kraut-y dalliances of more recent fare, With Light And With Love showcases a more sophisticated brand of contemporary drug music that owes more to Magical Mystery Tour than motorik. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever thought of Woods as a pop group comprised of weirdos, or a weirdo band that happens to excel at playing pop songs almost in spite of itself, With Light And With Love provides a corrective in the form of songs that show these two elements as natural, inextricable bedfellows. Throughout the album, vocals are frequently emitted through Leslie speakers and guitars perform one-string ragas like Sandy Bull reared on shoegaze and skate videos. With Light And With Love is an album of deeply psychedelic, deeply satisfying songs for a new age of searchers, of Don Juan and Animal Chin alike.- James Toth","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fdac83f7839cb455c69bd93ccd49ceb18450737","amp;dn":"Woods+-+With+Light+and+With+Love+%5B2014%5D+%5BAlbum%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fdac83f7839cb455c69bd93ccd49ceb18450737","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,218,200,63,120,57,203,69,92,105,189,147,204,212,156,235,24,69,7,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
