Abby shows us by example how to overcome problems and live a happier, braver life.&quot;  â€”Sheryl Sandberg,COO, New York Times Bestselling author of Lean In \r\n\r\nAbby Wambach has always pushed the limits of what is possible. At age seven she was put on the boysâ€™ soccer team. At age thirty-five she would become the highest goal scorerâ€”male or femaleâ€”in the history of soccer, capturing the nationâ€™s heart with her teamâ€™s 2015 World Cup Championship. Called an inspiration and â€œbadassâ€ by President Obama, Abby has become a fierce advocate for womenâ€™s rights and equal opportunity, pushing to translate the success of her team to the real world.\r\n\r\nAs she reveals in this searching memoir, Abbyâ€™s professional success often masked her inner struggle to reconcile the various parts of herself: ferocious competitor, daughter, leader, wife. With stunning candor, Abby shares her inspiring and often brutal journey from girl in Rochester, New York, to world-class athlete. Far more than a sports memoir, Forward is gripping tale of resilience and redemptionâ€”and a reminder that heroism is, above all, about embracing lifeâ€™s challenges with fearlessness and heart","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ba32ceae7d4afabc1cf187c11319e5bca550b97","amp;dn":"Forward%3A+A+Memoir+%282016%29+by+Abby+Wambach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ba32ceae7d4afabc1cf187c11319e5bca550b97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,163,44,234,231,212,175,171,193,207,24,124,17,49,158,91,202,85,11,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
