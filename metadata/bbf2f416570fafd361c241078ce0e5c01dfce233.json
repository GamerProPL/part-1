At his lessons Alexander Panchenko, following the advice of world champions J.R.Capablanka and V.V.Smislov, placed the highest emphasis on endgame (without neglecting the other stages of a chess game, for sure). The result surpassed all expectations: dozens of Grandmasters and Masters graduated from the school - Sergey Rublevsky, Alice Galliamova, Ruslan Scherbakov, Maxim Sorokin, Michael Ulibin, Svetlana Prudnikova, Tatiana Shumjakina and many others. \r\n\r\nCONTENTS \r\nvol 1 \r\no PAWN ENDINGS \r\no KNIGHT ENDINGS \r\no BISHOPS OF OPPOSITE COLOR o OPPOSITE COLORED BISHOPS WITH ROOKS OR QUEENS ON THE BOARD o BISHOPS OF THE SAME COLOR o BISHOP AGAINST KNIGHT \r\no BISHOP PAIR IN THE ENDGAME \r\no Solutions to the Contest Tasks \r\nvol 2 \r\no Extra Exchange \r\no Rook Against Pawns \r\no Rook Endings \r\no Endings with Four Rooks \r\no Queen Endings \r\no Queen Against Two Rooks \r\no Multi-Piece Endings \r\no Solutions to the Contest Tasks\r\n \nhttps://s31.postimg.org/8b0k4ad63/Theory_and_practice_of_chess_endings.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbf2f416570fafd361c241078ce0e5c01dfce233","amp;dn":"Theory+and+Practice+of+Chess+Endings+%28Vol.+1%2B2%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbf2f416570fafd361c241078ce0e5c01dfce233","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,242,244,22,87,15,175,211,97,194,65,7,140,224,229,192,29,252,226,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
