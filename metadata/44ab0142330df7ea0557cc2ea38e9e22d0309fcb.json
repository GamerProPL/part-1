The band achieved its greatest success in the 1980s with its pop-rock sound, which garnered many charting singles, especially in the United States. The band is best known for its Double Platinum-certified 1982 mega-hit &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot;, the theme song for the motion picture Rocky III (US #1 for 6 weeks). Singles like &quot;Burning Heart&quot; (US #2), &quot;The Search Is Over&quot; (US #4), &quot;High on You&quot; (US #8) and &quot;I Can't Hold Back (US #13) continued to chart in the mid-1980s.\n\nThe band tweaked its musical direction in 1988 with the release of the slightly heavier Too Hot to Sleep, but due to changes in the music industry and shift of popularity towards &quot;glam rock&quot; bands like MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e and Poison, the album barely reached the Billboard 200 in the United States. Because of this, the band split. Singer Jimi Jamison later toured as &quot;Survivor&quot; in the mid-1990s, to the chagrin of the rest of the band. Jamison re-united with the band's other members in 2000 and the band released Reach in 2006, but Jamison left the band after its release and was replaced by Robin McAuley. The band has continued to tour with McAuley into 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreatest Hits 1993\n\n\n\nGreatest Hits is a 1993 compilation album by the American rock band Survivor.\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; (Peterik, Sullivan) - 4:09 \n2.\t&quot;You Know Who You Are&quot; (Peterik/Sullivan) - 4:51 \n3.\t&quot;Burning Heart&quot; (Peterik/Sullivan) - 3:49 \n4.\t&quot;The Search Is Over&quot; (Peterik, Sullivan) - 4:13 \n5.\t&quot;High on You&quot; (Peterik, Sullivan) - 4:09 \n6.\t&quot;Is This Love&quot; (Peterik, Sullivan) - 3:42 \n7.\t&quot;I Can't Hold Back&quot; (Peterik, Sullivan) - 3:59 \n8.\t&quot;Hungry Years&quot; (Bickler/Peterik/Sullivan) - 5:12 \n9.\t&quot;American Heartbeat&quot; (Peterik, Sullivan) - 4:10 \n10.\t&quot;Poor Man's Son&quot; (Peterik, Sullivan) - 3:37 \n11.\t&quot;The Moment of Truth&quot; (Beckett/Conti/Lambert) - 3:46 \n12.\t&quot;Somewhere in America&quot; (Peterik) - 5:13 \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44ab0142330df7ea0557cc2ea38e9e22d0309fcb","amp;dn":"Survivor+-+Greatest+Hits+1993+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44ab0142330df7ea0557cc2ea38e9e22d0309fcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,171,1,66,51,13,247,234,5,87,204,46,163,142,158,34,208,48,159,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
