At a time when the cooler sounds of West Coast jazz began to dominate the public face of the music, Brubeck proved there was an audience for the style far beyond the confines of the in-crowd, and with his emphasis on unusual time signatures and adventurous tonalities, Brubeck showed that ambitious and challenging music could still be accessible.\n And as rock &amp; roll began to dominate the landscape of popular music at the dawn of the '60s, Brubeck enjoyed some of his greatest commercial and critical success, expanding the audience for jazz and making it hip with young adults and college students","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f8f4491d247efb74212427b1c093ceb8d8e80f5","amp;dn":"Dave+Brubeck+-+The+Very+Best+Of+%282015%29+3+CD%27s+%40+MP3+%5BRemastered%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f8f4491d247efb74212427b1c093ceb8d8e80f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,143,68,145,210,71,239,183,66,18,66,123,28,9,60,235,141,142,128,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
