Hofstadt\n\nA Musico-Logical Offering. The book opens with the story of Bach's Musical\nOffering. Bach made an impromptu visit to King Frederick the Great of Prussia, and was\nrequested to improvise upon a theme presented by the King. His improvisations formed the basis\nof that great work. The Musical Offering and its story form a theme upon which I &quot;improvise&quot;\nthroughout the book, thus making a sort of &quot;Metamusical Offering&quot;. Self-reference and the\ninterplay between different levels in Bach are discussed: this leads to a discussion of parallel\nideas in Escher's drawings and then GÃƒÂ¶delÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Theorem. A brief presentation of the history of logic\nand paradoxes is given as background for GÃƒÂ¶delÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Theorem. This leads to mechanical reasoning\nand computers, and the debate about whether Artificial Intelligence is possible. I close with an\nexplanation of the origins of the book-particularly the why and wherefore of the Dialogues.\n\nMore read through the book.......\n\nAuthor: D.
