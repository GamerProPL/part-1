The LP, credited to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Eric Clapton &amp; Friends,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ will feature like-minded collaborators John Mayer, Willie Nelson, Tom Petty, Derek Trucks, Mark Knopfler and Don White. Together, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll honor CaleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legacy as a songwriter, guitarist and pioneer of the Tulsa Sound.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I would like people to tap into what JJ Cale did Ã¢â‚¬â€œ thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the point,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Clapton says in a statement. Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m just the messenger; IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always felt that thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s my job. I try to interpret things so that the public at large, or at least the people who listen to what I do, will become intrigued about where I got it from.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nCale passed away in 2013 at age 74 after suffering a heart attack. But his influence is immeasurable: Across his four-decade career, he recorded 15 albums and inspired a generation of artists like Clapton, who brought his songs to a bigger audience through popular cover versions. Clapton first honored Cale by covering the latterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic Ã¢â‚¬Å“After MidnightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for Eric Clapton, the guitaristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solo debut. In 1977, Clapton recorded a chart-topping version of CaleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“CocaineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for his 1977 LP, Slowhand.\n\nThe two artists kept in touch over the years: In 2004, Cale played at the first edition of ClaptonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guitar festival Crossroads, with the latter sitting in as a bandmember. Then in 2006, they recorded their first studio collaboration on the 2006 album Road to Escondido. At the time, Clapton reflected on the honor, saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is the realization of what may have been my last ambition, to work with the man whose music has inspired me for as long as I can remember.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e858ea7c8098abe2ebbad05b39ac9732915b4523","amp;dn":"Eric+Clapton+%26amp%3B+Friends+-+The+Breeze+An+Appreciation+of+JJ+Ca","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e858ea7c8098abe2ebbad05b39ac9732915b4523","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,88,234,124,128,152,171,226,235,186,208,91,57,172,151,50,145,91,69,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
