Shadows incorporates as many of the techniques of emo and screamo as he can jam into these 11 tracks.  For their third album, Huntington Beach, California's Avenged Sevenfold aren't exactly giving a history lesson in heavy metal, but they have learned quite a few tricks of the genre.  There's the epic scope of their seven-plus minute compositions (and there are four of those here) where they counterbalance their merciless assault with atmospherics that suggest one day they will &quot;mature&quot; to mainstream accessibility.  (Don't laugh, it happened for Metallica.) There's also the steamrolling passion of their shorter tunes (the economical five-minutes of &quot;Burn It Down&quot;), proving that Avenged Sevenfold are jacks of all metal trades.  Guitarists Zacky Vengeance and Synyster Gates obviously know how to employ a twin-guitar attack - even if it is occasionally blurred by cellos or the occasional ballad.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:244a38c9d158316eba7216335022a4778c846668","amp;dn":"Avenged+Sevenfold+-+City+Of+Evil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"244a38c9d158316eba7216335022a4778c846668","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,74,56,201,209,88,49,110,186,114,22,51,80,34,164,119,140,132,102,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
