Triumphs,\n\n blunders, singles, videos, and everything else he\n\n does is huge, but having the audacity to call his\n\n third effort Deeper Than Rap is extra risky,\n\n especially since it's his first effort since\n\n being &quot;exposed&quot; as a former corrections officer.\n\n That's poison in the gangsta rap game, and while\n\n there's little here to sway the haters -- and\n\n certainly nothing &quot;deep&quot; -- the rapper's ability\n\n to steamroll over all of his shortcomings, along\n\n with all of our preconceived notions, is simply\n\n remarkable. In a sure trilogy of albums, Deeper\n\n Than Rap is the surest, kicking off with a decent\n\n 50 Cent diss and closing with a &quot;Run with me or\n\n run from me&quot; ultimatum that's gutsy enough to\n\n feature harps and castanets. While that's enough\n\n fuel for the haters to burn the whole place down,\n\n anyone willing to ignore Ross' iffy relationship\n\n with street cred and his incredibly narrow\n\n subject matter (money, women, victory) will find\n\n Deeper is the superstar, gangster weekend album\n\n done right. Boss of them all is the grand\n\n &quot;Maybach Music&quot; with T-Pain, Kanye West, and Lil\n\n Wayne all in top form. Same goes for the cut's\n\n production team, the J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, who\n\n are also in charge of the slippery and swaggering\n\n &quot;Magnificent&quot; with John Legend, plus the\n\n Caribbean-flavored highlight &quot;Yacht Club.&quot;\n\n &quot;Face,&quot; with Trina, is the street cut of note,\n\n and &quot;Usual Suspects&quot; places in the album's top\n\n five, although Nas' loyal fanbase will find his\n\n contribution rather ordinary. Redundancy is an\n\n unsurprising and ignorable issue thanks to all\n\n the hooks and slick beats, including a batch from\n\n the returning Runners. Even if this isn't much\n\n &quot;Deeper&quot; than the average Three 6 Mafia album,\n\n the glitz and guts of Deeper are a big step up,\n\n making Ross sound like a Miami-fied version of\n\n Young Jeezy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b09c2b9b504abbc1108fbb77444aaceb17e4c00","amp;dn":"Rick_Ross-Deeper_Than_Rap-2009-DeBT_iNT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b09c2b9b504abbc1108fbb77444aaceb17e4c00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,9,194,185,181,4,171,188,17,8,251,183,116,68,170,206,177,126,76,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
