From such classics as Musso &amp; Frank and The Brown Derby in the 1920s to the see-and-be-seen crowds at ChasenÃ¢Â€â„¢s, Romanoffs, and CiroÃ¢Â€â„¢s in the mid-20th century to the dawn of California cuisine at Ma Maison and Spago Sunset in the 1970s and Ã¢Â€â„¢80s, L.A.Ã¢Â€â„¢s Legendary Restaurants celebrates the famous locations where Hollywood ate, drank, and played.\r\n\r\nAuthor George Geary leads you into the glamorous restaurants inhabited by the stars through a lively narrative filled with colorful anecdotes and illustrated with vintage photographs, historic menus, and timeless ephemera. Over 100 iconic recipes for entrees, appetizers, desserts, and drinks are included.\r\n\r\nBut L.A.Ã¢Â€â„¢s Legendary Restaurants contains much more than the fancy, high-priced restaurants favored by the Hollywood cognoscenti. The glamour of the golden age of drive-ins, drugstores, nightclubs, and hotels are also honored. What book on L.A. restaurants would be complete without tales of ice cream sundaes at C.C. BrownÃ¢Â€â„¢s, cafeteria-style meals at CliftonÃ¢Â€â„¢s, or a mai tai at Don the Beachcomber?\r\n\r\nMost of the locations in L.A.Ã¢Â€â„¢s Legendary Restaurants no longer exist, but thanks to George Geary, the memories are still with us","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ff2337cd16610bb74af5a4890a245e5b5253c28","amp;dn":"L+A+s+Legendary+Restaurants+%282016%29+%28pdf%29+%5BWWRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ff2337cd16610bb74af5a4890a245e5b5253c28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,242,51,124,209,102,16,187,116,175,90,72,144,162,69,229,181,37,60,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
