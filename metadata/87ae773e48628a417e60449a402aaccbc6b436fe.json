First drawn up in 1869 by Dmitri Mendeleev, its 118 elements make up not only everything on our planet but also everything in the entire universe.\n\nThe Periodic Table looks at the fascinating story and surprising uses of each of those elements, whether solid, liquid or gas. From the little-known uses of gold in medicine to the development of the hydrogen bomb, each entry is accompanied by technical data (category, atomic number, weight, boiling point) presented in easy-to-read headers, and a colour coding system that helps the reader to navigate through the different groups of elements.\n\nA remarkable display of thought-provoking science and beautiful photography, this guide will allow the reader to discover the world afresh.\n\nThe Periodic Table - A Visual Guide to the Elements\nBook Language: English \nPages: 224\nFile Type: Pdf, epub, mobi\nFile Size: 78.54 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87ae773e48628a417e60449a402aaccbc6b436fe","amp;dn":"The+Periodic+Table+-+A+Visual+Guide+to+the+Elements","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87ae773e48628a417e60449a402aaccbc6b436fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,174,119,62,72,98,138,65,126,96,68,154,64,42,172,203,198,180,54,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
