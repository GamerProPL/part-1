Gareth Stedman Jones depicts an era dominated by extraordinary challenges and new notions about God, human capacities, empires, and political systemsâ€•and, above all, the shape of the future.\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of the Battle of Waterloo, a Europe-wide argument began about the industrial transformation of England, the Revolution in France, and the hopes and fears generated by these occurrences. Would the coming age belong to those enthralled by the revolutionary events and ideas that had brought this world into being, or would its inheritors be those who feared and loathed it? Stedman Jones gives weight not only to Marxâ€™s views but to the views of those with whom he contended. He shows that Marx was as buffeted as anyone else living through a period that both confirmed and confounded his interpretationsâ€•and that ultimately left him with terrible intimations of failure.\r\n\r\nKarl Marx allows the reader to understand Marxâ€™s milieu and development, and makes sense of the devastating impact of new ways of seeing the world conjured up by Kant, Hegel, Feuerbach, Ricardo, Saint-Simon, and others. We come to understand how Marx transformed and adapted their philosophies into ideas that would haveâ€•through twists and turns inconceivable to himâ€•an overwhelming impact across the globe in the twentieth century","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd77df8002deb029cd28b69bd030154c42cd0672","amp;dn":"Karl+Marx+%3A+Greatness+and+Illusion+%282016%29+%28EPUB%29+%5BWWRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd77df8002deb029cd28b69bd030154c42cd0672","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,119,223,128,2,222,176,41,205,40,182,155,208,48,21,76,66,205,6,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
