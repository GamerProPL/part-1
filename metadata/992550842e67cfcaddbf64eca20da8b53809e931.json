Again.\n\nNo matter what he does or the decisions he makes, when death comes, Harry always returns to where he began, a child with all the knowledge of a life he has already lived a dozen times before. Nothing ever changes.\n\nUntil now.\n\nAs Harry nears the end of his eleventh life, a little girl appears at his bedside. &quot;I nearly missed you, Doctor August,&quot; she says. &quot;I need to send a message.&quot;\n\nThis is the story of what Harry does next, and what he did before, and how he tries to save a past he cannot change and a future he cannot allow.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:992550842e67cfcaddbf64eca20da8b53809e931","amp;dn":"The+First+Fifteen+Lives+of+Harry+August+-+Claire+North","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"992550842e67cfcaddbf64eca20da8b53809e931","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,37,80,132,46,103,207,202,221,191,100,236,162,13,168,181,56,9,233,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
