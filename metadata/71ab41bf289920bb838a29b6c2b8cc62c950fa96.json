Ace of Spades is the most popular and famous Motorhead album. It's their British Steel, Number of the Beast, Dark Side of the Moon, Agents of Fortune, etc, etc. And like those albums, it's very strong and very solid. It's not the best album Motorhead has done, nor is it the only one someone should buy. These guys continue to put out great stuff(look no further than 2004's Inferno for that). \nOne of the best qualities of Motorhead is that there is no B.S. with these guys. They achieved their legendary status by simply being themselves and never having to compromise. Wanting to continue in the tradition of the original concepts of Rock and Roll music-music that is loud, wild, energetic, tough, dirty and bugs the hell out of parents-Motorhead have made it their mission to be the rowdiest, dirtiest and loudest rock band in the world. And they pull it off in....ahem....Spades. \nMotorhead hate being categorized as a heavy metal band. In many ways they are quite different than the metal bands of that time, but they do share the same intensity of those bands, even surpassing many of them. Because of it's volume and energy, it's quite easy to see why they earn this label. It is easier to think of them more as a very loud and energetic biker type rock band. The album cover pretty much sums up the sound of the band-Rough looking outlaw looking types who don't look like the kind of guys you wanna screw around with. \nAce of Spades is a very good intro to the newcomer. Some disagree with me, but I really don't feel there are any filler songs on this album. It is a great starting point, but don't think it's the only great album they did.\n\nby Stanley Runk\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Ace Of Spades.wma                                                \n02 - Love Me Like A Reptile.wma                                       \n03 - Shoot You In The Back.wma                                        \n04 - Live To Win.wma                                                  \n05 - Fast And Loose.wma                                               \n06 - (We Are) The Road Crew.wma                                       \n07 - Fire, Fire.wma                                                   \n08 - Jailbait.wma                                                     \n09 - Dance.wma                                                        \n10 - Bite The Bullet.wma                                              \n11 - The Chase Is Better Than The Catch.wma                           \n12 - The Hammer.wma                                                   \n13 - Dirty Love (B-side 'Ace Of Spades' Single) (Bonus Track).wma     \n14 - Ace Of Spades (Alternative Version) (Bonus Track).wma            \n15 - Love Me Like A Reptile (Alternative Version) (Bonus Track).wma   \n16 - Love Me Like A Reptile (Alternative Version) (Bonus Track).wma   \n17 - Shoot You In The Back (Alternative Version) (Bonus Track).wma    \n18 - Fast And Loose (Alternative Version) (Bonus Track).wma           \n19 - (We Are) The Road Crew (Alternative Version) (Bonus Track).wma   \n20 - Fire, Fire (Alternative Version) (Bonus Track).wma               \n21 - Jailbait (Alternative Version) (Bonus Track).wma                 \n22 - The Hammer (Alternative Version) (Bonus Track).wma               \n23 - Dirty Love (Alternative Version) (Bonus Track).wma               \n24 - Dirty Love (Alternative Version) (Bonus Track).wma\n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO\n\n\nFOLLOW ME ON FACEBOOK PAGES: MARCELODRGZTPB\n\nATTENTION: I will read comments on all the material shared only on my Facebook page (MARCELODRGZTPB).
