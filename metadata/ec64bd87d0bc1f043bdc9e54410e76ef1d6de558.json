End Come Too Soon\n\nWild Beasts release their third full length, entitled Smother. Their 2009 album Two Dancers was critically acclaimed and even earned them a nomination in the prestigious Mercury Awards. A year and a half later, Smother reveals a much more mature band. They've kept their distinct sound intact: oscillating falsetto and baritone vocals, lyrical wit, and a penchant for seedier topics. However, this album incorporates rich electronic textures and a subtlety of melody not heard in their earlier work. Wild Beasts fans will not be disappointed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec64bd87d0bc1f043bdc9e54410e76ef1d6de558","amp;dn":"Wild+Beasts-Smother+2011%28320+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec64bd87d0bc1f043bdc9e54410e76ef1d6de558","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,100,189,135,208,188,31,4,59,220,158,84,65,14,118,239,29,109,229,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
