This debut long-player arrives with additional short films and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœimagined novelsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ by mysterious fictional wordsmith George Ranger Johnson, designed, according to Schneider, to create Ã¢â‚¬Å“a world with its own mythologyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. For all that, Lord Huron is, at heart, a rootsy, all-American affair, albeit with added sonic dimensions. It offers an ingenuous, prairie-wide signature thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s closer to the numinous folk-rock of Fleet Foxes than any self-consciously Ã¢â‚¬ËœartyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, pan-genre peregrinations. \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:619583740801e6a3f221b1f95a0f2462002478b2","amp;dn":"Lord+Huron-+Lonesome+Dreams","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"619583740801e6a3f221b1f95a0f2462002478b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,149,131,116,8,1,230,163,242,33,177,249,90,15,36,98,0,36,120,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
