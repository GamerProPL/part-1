Melodyne3 also offers fully automatic        Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  analysis of the audio material, powerful macros for    Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  the correction of intonation and timing errors, and    Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  numerous improvements in the user interface.           Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  Melodyne3 is not only capable of doing far more than   Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  its predecessors; it is also faster and easier to      Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  use.                                                   Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º                                                         Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  Recording artists and engineers have known about       Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  Melodyne for years. Until now, though, it was only     Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  monophonic vocal and instrumental parts that could     Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  benefit from MelodyneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s much-admired editing           Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  algorithms: algorithms capable of everything from      Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  minor corrections of intonation to extreme pitch       Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  shifting and from the subtle modification of grooves   Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  to drastic time stretching. With version 3, Melodyne   Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  is no longer limited to melodies but offers a unique   Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  algorithm that can perform high quality time           Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  stretching on full chords and complex audio signals;   Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  so now harmonic material (such as rhythm guitar or     Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  piano parts) Ã¢â‚¬â€ whether homophonic or polyphonic Ã¢â‚¬â€ can  Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  be transposed (without altering the tempo), slowed     Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  down or sped up (without altering the pitch) and even  Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  quantized. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more, all this can be done in real   Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  time with the sound quality for which Melodyne is      Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  famous.                                                Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º                                                         Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  Melodyne3 employs the same audio analysis engine as    Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  Melodyne uno: the process of note recognition is       Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  therefore fully automatic and the results more         Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  reliable and delivered more swiftly than heretofore.   Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one way in which Melodyne3 makes working with   Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  audio files easier. Others are the Correct Pitch and   Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  Quantize Time macros, which allow the most common      Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  flaws in vocal and instrumental recordings to be       Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  removed with a few mouse clicks.                       Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º                                                         Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  Melodyne3 is not just far easier to operate and        Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  better attuned to the working practices of musicians   Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  and recording engineers than its predecessors but      Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  also better structured. Context-sensitive combi-       Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  tools, logically arranged menus and intuitive new      Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  methods of operating in the arrange and edit windows   Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  streamline the workflow as well as reducing the time   Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  taken to master the program. There are also notable    Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  improvements in the way Melodyne integrates into       Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  other sequencing applications and Melodyne3 can read   Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  sound libraries created using Melodyne technology      Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  such as those of UeberschallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Liquid Instruments,     Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  thereby obtaining access to an almost inexhaustible    Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  supply of licks and phrases.                           Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º                                                         Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The ability at last to apply MelodyneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique        Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  editing functions to any type of audio material is     Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  certainly the main argument for Melodyne3,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says       Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  Peter NeubÃƒÂ¤cker, the founder and mastermind of         Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  Celemony. Ã¢â‚¬Å“This uniquely flexible way of handling      Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  audio material will lead to a whole new style of       Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  working in the studio: with Melodyne3, the note-based  Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  rearrangement and remixing of songs are childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s play,  Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve streamlined the workflow in numerous ways    Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  in response to requests from users. As a result,       Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  Melodyne is far simpler and more practice-oriented     Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  than ever before.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n                ____________________________________________________\n\n\nTested clean on a Windows 8 x64 virtual machine running with ESET Nod 32 5.2.9.1\nVirus database v.8272 (2013 04 26)\nTested crack and stability on Windows 7 x64 \nTime tested: + 10 hours\n\nIT WILL RUN ON BOTH Windows 64-bit and 32-bit\n\n\n                ____________________________________________________\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n\n\n         Ãƒâ€º  1) Unzip, Unrar and run Setup.exe                      Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º                                                         Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  2) Use Keygen to register                              Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º                                                         Ãƒâ€º\n         Ãƒâ€º  3) Enjoy this fine Team AiR release !!!                \n\n\n                ____________________________________________________\n\nSupport the software creators !\n\n________________\n\nPS: Help me to seed please, I have a 1 mbps bandwidth and this is the only release of Celemony.Melodyne.Studio.Edition.v3.1.2.0 on The Pirate Bay !\nPost feedback please as i'm a new uploader ! :)\n\n________________\n\nTHANKS TO TEAM AIR\nABOD.
