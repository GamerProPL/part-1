It was written by Usher, Lil Jon, Sean Garrett, Patrick J. Que Smith, Ludacris, Robert McDowell and LRoc, and features guest vocals from Lil Jon and Ludacris. It was also produced by Lil Jon, who incorporated crunk and R&amp;BÃ¢â‚¬â€which he coined as Crunk&amp;BÃ¢â‚¬â€in the song's production. The song was released as the lead single from Usher's fourth studio album Confessions (2004) on January 27, 2004, after Usher was told by Arista Records, his label at the time, to record more tracks for the album.\n&quot;Yeah!&quot; topped the US Billboard Hot 100 chart for twelve consecutive weeks, before being replaced by its follow-up single &quot;Burn&quot;. &quot;Yeah!&quot; was the longest-running number one single in 2004, subsequently topping the year-end chart on the Hot 100. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song received a similar response in other countries, topping fourteen charts worldwide. It was certified platinum in several countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany and Norway, and received a two times platinum certification in New Zealand. The song peaked in the top-ten in several Year-end charts.\n&quot;Yeah!&quot; was met with universal critical acclaim, with critics lauding its production, more specifically its combination of crunk and R&amp;B.
