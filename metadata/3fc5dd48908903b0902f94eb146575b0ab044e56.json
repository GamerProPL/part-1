The book demonstrates the main methodologies that have evolved from the 1970s to date. Calculation of engineering cases and estimation of system stress and strength are demonstrated in the chapters. A wide range of actual cases span a wide array of engineering fields, including power systems, metallurgy, mining, structures, and machines","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fc5dd48908903b0902f94eb146575b0ab044e56","amp;dn":"Applied+Engineering+Failure+Analysis+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fc5dd48908903b0902f94eb146575b0ab044e56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,197,221,72,144,137,3,176,144,47,148,235,20,101,117,176,171,4,78,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
