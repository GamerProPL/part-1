Guitarist Dan Murphy, bassist Karl Mueller, and drummer Dave Pirner formed in 1981 as Loud Fast Rules in Minneapolis, MN. When the shambolic, no-longer-teenage band burst onto the scene in 1984, Soul Asylum had added Grant Young on drums and switched Pirner to rhythm guitar and vocals for the loud and fast Twin Tone album Say What You Will, Clarence...Karl Sold the Truck. However, the record was overshadowed by the current releases by fellow Twin Cities denizens the Replacements and HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼sker DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼; Soul Asylum have gone on record stating they were dubbed &quot;the B-teamers&quot; by the Replacements, which created bad feelings between the bands for years.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.
