No Excuses! shows you how you can achieve success in all three major areas of your life, including your personal goals, business and money goals, and overall happiness. \nEach of the 21 chapters in this book shows you how to be more disciplined in one aspect of your life, with end-of-chapter exercises to help you apply the &quot;no excuses&quot; approach to your own life. With these guidelines, you can learn how to be more successful in everything you do--instead of wistfully envying others you think are just &quot;luckier&quot; than you. A little self-discipline goes a long wayÃ¢â‚¬Â¦so stop making excuses and read this book!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ec0ca61b8845db5a6b9747bf2dda4c689d948e1","amp;dn":"No+Excuses%21+The+Power+of+Self-Discipline+by+Brian+Tracy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ec0ca61b8845db5a6b9747bf2dda4c689d948e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,192,202,97,184,132,93,181,166,185,116,123,242,221,164,198,137,217,72,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
