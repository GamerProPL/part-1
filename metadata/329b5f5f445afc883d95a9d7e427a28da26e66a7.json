I really recommend reading the readme (something most people don't, probably because it usually contains a lot of bs)\nSince the official multiplayer support by GameSpy for this game is dead, because GameSpy is gone you need to &quot;update&quot; it manually first to be able to play online. In the Revive Multiplayer folder you'll find everything you need to do so.\nTo play the multiplayer register an account for free here. It's the only way to still play online, but it's definitely worth it.\nBy the way, this is one of the last ways to still play this fantastic game. EA stopped selling it on Origin, and Steam also stopped selling copies. The only legal way to still obtain a copy is buying a hardcopy on Amazon for example, but those are also hard to come by these days, expecially with a working serial key. Sad to see EA is no longer supporting one of their best releases ever.\n\nAbout the game:\nIn Battlefield 2, players will choose to fight for one of three military superpowers: the United States, the Chinese, or the newly formed Middle East Coalition. Armed with the latest modern weaponry, players can take control of any of the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 30+ vehicles to engage in major conflicts with over 64 players in some of the largest online battles on the PC. Additionally, persistent character growth allows players to rise through the ranks and attain the ultimate rank of General. With more than 2 million copies sold, this proven classic brings the intensity and excitement of Battlefield 1942Ã¢â€žÂ¢ into the modern era with enhanced team play and the latest, most technologically advanced vehicles and weapons systems available to man.\n\n\nThanks for downloading and don't forget to seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:329b5f5f445afc883d95a9d7e427a28da26e66a7","amp;dn":"Battlefield+2+-+Multiplayer+and+Singleplayer+-+version+1.50","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"329b5f5f445afc883d95a9d7e427a28da26e66a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,155,95,95,68,90,252,136,61,149,169,215,228,39,162,141,162,110,102,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
