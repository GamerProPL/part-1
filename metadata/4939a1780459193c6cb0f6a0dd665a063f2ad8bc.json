Rather than leave the 60+ GB of files that will never be used on my external to take up space (which I could use for comic books), I'm going to burn them off to blu-ray data discs and file them away in hopes that they may be used at some point in the future.\n\nNo big descriptions or explanations with these - you either know what they are, and that you want them, or you don't.\n\n\nThis is exactly what it says it is; a collection of maps, dungeons, dungeon tiles and monster tokens. For some people, and some DMs specifically, this collection could be very useful. At the very least it occasionally helped with finding an idea when I was stuck. But for the general player, there probably isn't much here that will cream your twinkie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4939a1780459193c6cb0f6a0dd665a063f2ad8bc","amp;dn":"Dungeons+and+Dragons+Maps+Dungeons+Tiles+Tokens","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4939a1780459193c6cb0f6a0dd665a063f2ad8bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,57,161,120,4,89,25,60,108,176,246,160,221,102,90,6,63,42,216,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
