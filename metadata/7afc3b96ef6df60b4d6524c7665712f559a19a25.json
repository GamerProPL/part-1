AnthraxÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs Scott Ian was a big fan of the band, who released numerous albums and did session work with everyone from Henry Rollins to George Clinton to Queens of the Stone Age.\n\nNow, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs are being brought back to life by the new supergroup Motor Sister. The existence of the project was revealed a couple months ago, and now we know more information about the band and their debut album.\n\nMotor Sister includes Mother Superior frontman Jim Wilson, Joey Vera (Fates Warning, Armored Saint) and John Tempesta (White Zombie, The Cult) along with Scott Ian and his wife Pearl Aday. Ian says the group began due to his 50th birthday party wish of wanting to hear Mother Superior play again. Pearl, who has worked with Wilson for years, set things up.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I wanted to cherry-pick a set list of my favorite Mother Superior songs and get these guys together and have the concert at my house,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ian says of the event that eventually led to an album.\n\nIan continues, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jim was totally into the idea. Pearl was a huge Mother Superior fan from way back and was in. I asked my good friends Joey Vera and John Tempesta to be a part of it because I knew they were both big fans as well and with no hesitation they said, Ã¢â‚¬ËœWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nWilson says he was excited to be part of the project: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I definitely didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need any arm-twisting. I was totally flattered and thought it was a great idea. I figured it would be fun and it was a great opportunity for a new chapter to be established in order to move forward.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nMotor SisterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album Ã¢â‚¬ËœRideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was recorded in two days at IanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home studio by Anthrax producer Jay Ruston. The album will be released March 10 via Metal Blade.image\n\nMotor Sister, Ã¢â‚¬ËœRideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Track Listing\n\n1. Ã¢â‚¬ËœA HoleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\n2. Ã¢â‚¬ËœThis Song Reminds Me of YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\n3.
