Foucault is best known for his critical studies of social institutions, most notably psychiatry, the social anthropology of medicine, the human sciences, the prison system, and the history of human sexuality. His writings on power, knowledge, and discourse have been widely influential in academic circles.\n\nAll of the following books are in PDF format:\n\n* Abnormal: Lectures at the CollÃƒÂ¨ge de France, 1974-75 (Verso, 2003)\n* The Archaeology of Knowledge (Routledge, 2002)\n\n* The Birth of Biopolitics: Lectures at the CollÃƒÂ¨ge de France, 1978-79 (Palgrave, 2008)\n* The Birth of the Clinic: An Archaeology of Medical Perception (Routledge, 2003)\n\n* The Courage of Truth: Lectures at the CollÃƒÂ¨ge de France, 1983-84 (Palgrave, 2011)\n\n* Death and the Labyrinth: The World of Raymond Roussel (Continuum, 2007)\n* Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison (Vintage, 1995)\n\n* Essential Works, Vol. 1: Ethics, Subjectivity and Truth (New Press, 1997)\n* Essential Works, Vol. 2: Aesthetics, Method and Epistemology (New Press, 1998)\n* Essential Works, Vol. 3: Power (New Press, 2001)\n\n* Foucault Reader [ed.
