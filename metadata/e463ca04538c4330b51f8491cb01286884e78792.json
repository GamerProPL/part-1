His life is a daily struggle to save the men under his command from starvation, from cholera, from pitiless beatings.  Until he receives a letter that will change him forever.\n\nMoving deftly from the POW camp to contemporary Australia, from the experiences of Dorrigo and his comrades to those of the Japanese guards, this savagely beautiful novel tells a story of love, death, and family, exploring the many forms of good and evil, war and truth, guilt and transcendence, as one man comes of age, prospers, only to discover all that he has lost.\n\n\nReviews\n\nA novel of extraordinary power, deftly told and hugely affecting.  A classic in the making. . . Masterful.&quot; -- Alex Preston The Observer\n\n&quot;Elegantly wrought, measured and without an ounce of melodrama, Flanagan's novel is nothing short of a masterpiece.&quot; -- Financial Times\n\n&quot;The poetry in this novel isn't just by Japanese poets.  It is in the prose: strong, muscular, rhythmic, sometimes biblical in its resonances, and charged with a hypnotic power . . . devastatingly beautiful.&quot; -- Christina Patterson, The Sunday Times\n\n&quot;Nothing could have prepared us for this immense achievement.  The Narrow Road to the Deep North is beyond comparison. . . Intensely moving.&quot; -- The Australian\n\n&quot;Utterly convincing . . . [An] examination of what it is to be a good man and a bad man in the one flesh, and, above all, of how it is to live after survival. . . To say Flanagan creates a rich tapestry is to overly praise tapestries.&quot; -- Thomas Keneally, Guardian\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                              &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
