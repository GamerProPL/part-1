What do photographs mean? How can they be used? â€“ they give their answers in terms of a photograph as 'a meeting place where the interests of the photographer, the photographed, the viewer and those who are using the photography are often contradictory'. From these beginnings they develop a theory of photography that has at its centre the form's essential ambiguity, arguing that photography is totally unlike a film and has nothing to do with reportage. Rather, it constitutes 'another way of telling'.\r\n\r\nThe unique combination of critic and photographer results in a work that moves beyond the landmarks established by Walter Benjamin, Roland Barthes and Susan Sontag to establish a new theory of photography","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6acd434daa4c3a00436838986cf0ebe1c6930d71","amp;dn":"Another+Way+of+Telling%3A+A+New+Theory+of+Photography+%282016%29%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6acd434daa4c3a00436838986cf0ebe1c6930d71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,205,67,77,170,76,58,0,67,104,56,152,108,240,235,225,198,147,13,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
