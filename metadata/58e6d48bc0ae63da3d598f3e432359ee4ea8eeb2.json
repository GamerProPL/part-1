Campbell (ASM International, 2012).pdf\r\n\r\nThis well-written text is for non-metallurgists and anyone seeking a quick refresher on an essential tool of modern metallurgy. The basic principles, construction, interpretation, and use of alloy phase diagrams are clearly described with ample illustrations for all important liquid and solid reactions. Gas-metal reactions, important in metals processing and in-service corrosion, also are discussed. Get the basics on how phase diagrams help predict and interpret the changes in the structure of alloys.
