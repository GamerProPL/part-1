W. Norton &amp; Company\nMikael Krogerus ,Roman TschÃƒÂ¤ppeler, Philip Earnhar\n2012\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0393079619\nISBN-13: 978-0393079616\n176 pages\nPDF\n2.68 MB\n\nA short, sharp guide to tackling lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest challenges: understanding ourselves and making the right choices.\nEvery day offers moments of decision, from what to eat for lunch to how to settle a dispute with a colleague. Still larger questions loom: How can I motivate my team? How can I work more efficiently? What is the long tail anyway? \n\n Whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a newly minted MBA, a chronic second-guesser, or just someone eager for a new vantage point, The Decision Book presents fifty models for better structuring, and subsequently understanding, lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s steady challenges. Interactive and thought-provoking, this illustrated workbook offers succinct summaries of popular strategies, including the Rubber Band Model for dilemmas with many directions, the Personal Performance Model to test whether to change jobs, and the Black Swan Model to illustrate why experience doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t guarantee wisdom. Packed with familiar tools like the Pareto Principle, the PrisonerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dilemma, and an unusual exercise inspired by Warren Buffet, The Decision Book is the ideal reference for flexible thinkers. 58 illustrations\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d57d252485b0fcf03fed7fe41afe41961dd0abc2","amp;dn":"The+Decision+Book%3A+50+Models+for+Strategic+Thinking+-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d57d252485b0fcf03fed7fe41afe41961dd0abc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,125,37,36,133,176,252,240,63,237,127,228,26,254,65,150,29,208,171,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
