The complex story lines are the perfect analog for MONUMENTS. Musically, the group weave in and out of themes, motifs, and professor-like note calculations with graceful ease. But lyrically Ã¢â‚¬Å“The AmanuensisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ comes from a very different place. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The album is about the Samsara cycle,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ reveals Browne (guitar). Ã¢â‚¬Å“The cyclical existence of life that we are all bound to.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n The story of Ã¢â‚¬Å“The AmanuensisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is divided in 11 chapters whose titles read as follows:\n\n1. I, The Creator\n2. Origin Of Escape\n3. Atlas\n4. Horcrux\n5. Garden Of Sankhara\n6. The Alchemist\n7. Quasimodo\n8. Saga City\n9. Jinn\n10. I, The Destroyer\n11.
