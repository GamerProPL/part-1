The Whispers have been making consistent, soulful music for over three decades. The &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; collection covers a good chunk of their best material from the mid 1970s up to the early 1990s. The vocals are always smooth and the musical styles range from Philly soul to disco to electro-funk to quiet storm. It's a historic and excellent look back at what music sounded like before hip-hop became the grammar of R&amp;B music.\n\nHighlights include &quot;(Olivia) Lost and Turned Out,&quot; a live concert favorite (and possibly the smoothest vocals ever on a song about prostitution), &quot;And The Beat Goes On,&quot; a 1980 disco hit sampled by rapper Will Smith in his hit &quot;Miami,&quot; the aforementioned &quot;Beat,&quot; and the Gary Taylor-penned &quot;Just Gets Better With Time.&quot;\nSome of the tracks are a little dated (&quot;Contageous,&quot; &quot;One For the Money&quot;) but all possess the careful craftsmanship and understated but soulful vocals that have made The Whispers popular over the years. If you're a casual fan, buy this without hesitation. If you're a serious fan, this is a good place to start.\n\n\nimage\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhispers, The - Greatest Hits\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Whispers, The\nAlbum................: Greatest Hits\nGenre................: R&amp;B\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1997 06 03\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 65 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 264kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
