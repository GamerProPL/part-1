What is the difference between the Plains Indian War Club and the Fijian War Club? What weapon is common to peoples in every part of the world? The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Weaponry is a comprehensive guide to arms and armaments throughout history.\r\n\r\nBeginning in the Stone Age, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Weaponry travels through the Bronze Age to our present day, showing the tools humans have used to defend themselves all around the globe. There's the Japanese tanto, or dagger, which have become identified with gangs known as yakuza. There's the flaming arrow used when Swiss and Austrian forces clashed in the 14th century. And there's the revolver that Samuel Colt made practical for both military and civilian use in Hartford, Connecticut.\r\n\r\nThe Illustrated Encyclopedia of Weaponry will help readers better understand how...and why...the battles of history were fought.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nChuck Wills is a writer, editor, and consultant specializing in history, with an emphasis on military history. His work in this area includes books on the Battle of Little Bighorn, Pearl Harbor, and the Tet Offensive, as well as several volumes of an illustrated history of the American Civil War.
