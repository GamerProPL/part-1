In order to avoid hardship and responsibilities that would otherwise be impossible to endure, the family chooses to ignore the truth, not to see, hear or talk about it. But does playing Three Monkeys invalidate the truth of its existence? \n\nAlthough it can be argued that its local touches can be appreciated more fully by Turkish audiences, &quot;3 Monkeys&quot; is a film that can definitely appeal to all film-lovers all over the world. It is a human drama, centered around the family of a fall-guy for a small-time politician. It is also a story of betrayal, longings and revenge. No shot is &quot;left there&quot; just for the effect. Even while you are watching someone walk under a train crossing, you find yourself thinking about what she might be feeling, thinking, not because you force yourself to, but because the film successfully makes you. Visuals are great, as always is with Ceylan, but this time they are superior, and the film, with both its screenplay and visuals has a black-and-white feeling, although it is not a black-and-white picture. At the end, you find yourself wondering who the &quot;three wise monkeys&quot; really are. Is it the family of 3, whose members have different agendas and do not want to see or hear or tell, or is it us, for knowing, but not wanting to know about all this human drama and social corruption? I hope &quot;3 Monkeys&quot; can gain international distribution besides film festivals and be given a chance to be appreciated by everyone. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-225338.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-225338.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-223198.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-223198.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-223755.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-223755.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-224054.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-224054.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-224205.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-224205.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-225878.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-225878.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-226009.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-226009.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-226189.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-226189.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-226684.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-226684.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-227242.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-227242.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-227680.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM3/vlcsnap-227680.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,353,129,984                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD 1.1.2 Final              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:44:28                \nFrame Count:....................................156676             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................704                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................304                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................2.316                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1525                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.285&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2           \n\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
