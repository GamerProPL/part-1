Greatest Hits is a single disc, spanning the entire career of the band as well as two new songs, &quot;What Do You Got?&quot; and &quot;No Apologies.&quot;\n\nGreatest Hits Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Ultimate Collection is a double disc collection featuring the Greatest Hits album and second disc featuring fan favorites along with two more new songs: &quot;This Is Love, This Is Life&quot; and &quot;The More Things Change.&quot; The four new songs were written specifically for this new compilation project. The font used for the band's name on the album's cover is a return to the Bon Jovi logo used from 1985 to 1988 and it is also the first ever album to use the heart and dagger logo.\n\nIn addition to the four new songs, at least one song was included from each Bon Jovi studio album (with the exceptions of 7800Ã‚Â° Fahrenheit and Bounce, although a bonus track from 7800 Fahrenheit is included on international versions); two tracks from Bon Jovi's previous compilation album Cross Road were included as well. Also, one song, &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;, was added despite being a release from Jon Bon Jovi's solo album of the same name.\n\nBon Jovi performed a special, live streaming concert for the Live on Letterman web series on November 9, 2010. The band performed a significant part of the album during the hour long set.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n   \t\nDisc one \t\nNo. \t\n1. &quot;Livin' on a Prayer&quot; Slippery When Wet \t               4:13\n2. &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot; Slippery When Wet \t       3:46\n3. &quot;It's My Life&quot; Crush \t                               3:44\n4. &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; Have a Nice Day \t                       3:48\n5. &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; Slippery When Wet \t               5:11\n6. &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; New Jersey \t                               5:16\n7. &quot;We Weren't Born to Follow&quot; The Circle \t               4:03\n8. &quot;I'll Be There for You&quot; New Jersey \t                       5:46\n9. &quot;Born to Be My Baby&quot; New Jersey \t                       4:40\n10. &quot;Bed of Roses&quot;Keep the Faith \t                       6:38\n11. &quot;Who Says You Can't Go Home&quot; (rock version)Have a Nice Day 4:41\n12. &quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot; (radio edit) New Jersey \t       3:49\n13. &quot;Always&quot; Cross Road \t                               5:56\n14. &quot;In These Arms&quot; Keep the Faith \t                       5:19\n15. &quot;What Do You Got?&quot;Previously unreleased \t               3:47\n16. &quot;No Apologies&quot; Previously unreleased \t               3:44\n\nDisc two [Ultimate Collection only] \t\nNo.  \t\n1. &quot;Runaway&quot; Bon Jovi \t                                       3:53\n2. &quot;Someday I'll Be Saturday Night&quot; Cross Road \t               4:39\n3. &quot;Lost Highway&quot; Lost Highway \t                               4:04\n4. &quot;I'll Sleep When I'm Dead&quot; Keep the Faith \t               4:41\n5. &quot;In and Out of Love&quot; 7800Ã‚Â° Fahrenheit \t               4:26\n6. &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; Keep the Faith \t                       5:43\n7. &quot;When We Were Beautiful&quot; The Circle \t                       5:17\n8. &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; Blaze of Glory (Jon Bon Jovi solo) \t       5:39\n9. &quot;This Ain't a Love Song&quot; These Days \t                       5:05\n10. &quot;These Days&quot; These Days \t                               6:27\n11. &quot;(You Want To) Make a Memory&quot; Lost Highway \t               4:37\n12. &quot;Blood on Blood&quot; New Jersey \t                       6:16\n13. &quot;This Is Love, This Is Life&quot; Previously unreleased \t       3:25\n14. &quot;The More Things Change&quot; Previously unreleased \t       3:53\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90017fce31dd8b25feab24f920124605a4005f80","amp;dn":"Bon+Jovi+-+2010+-+Gratests+Hits+%282CD%29+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90017fce31dd8b25feab24f920124605a4005f80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,1,127,206,49,221,139,37,254,171,36,249,32,18,70,5,164,0,95,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
