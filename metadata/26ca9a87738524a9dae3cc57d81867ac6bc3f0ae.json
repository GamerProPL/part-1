The band's name is a pun on the name of American pop artist Andy Warhol.\n\nThe Dandy Warhols are strongly influenced by The Velvet Underground, Beach Boys, Simon and Garfunkel, The Beatles, The Shadows, and The Rolling Stones as well as including implicit musical references to My Bloody Valentine in some songs. Front man Courtney Taylor-Taylor describes the band's beginning as a group of friends who &quot;needed music to drink to.&quot;\n\nMore info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dandy_Warhols / http://www.last.fm/music/The+Dandy+Warhols / http://www.dandywarhols.com\n\nListing of all official releases by The Dandy Warhols (included in this torrent):\n\n* Dandys Rule, OK?\nYear: 1995\n\n* ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦The Dandy Warhols Come Down \nYear: 1997\n\n* Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia \nYear: 2000\n\n* Welcome To The Monkey House \nYear: 2003\n\n* The Black Album \nYear: 2004\n\n* Come on Feel the Dandy Warhols \nYear: 2004\n\n* Odditorium or Warlords of Mars \nYear: 2005\n\n* ...Earth to the Dandy Warhols... \nYear: 2008\n\n* The Dandy Warhols are Sound \nYear: 2009\n\nAll albums have been encoded from lossless sources (FLAC) with LAME to MP3 VBR using the V0 preset.
