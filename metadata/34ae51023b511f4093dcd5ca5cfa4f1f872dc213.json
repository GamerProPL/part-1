My life still is, some thirty years later.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Deepak Chopra, from the Introduction\n\nAlan W. WattsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“message for an age of anxietyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is as powerful today as it was when this modern classic was first published.\n \nWe spend too much time trying to anticipate and plan for the future; too much time lamenting the past. We often miss the pleasures of the moment in our anxious efforts to ensure the next moment is as enjoyable. Drawing from Eastern philosophy and religion, Watts argues that it is only by acknowledging what we do not and cannot know, that we can find something truly worth knowing. In order to lead a fulfilling life, one must embrace the presentÃ¢â‚¬â€live fully in the now.\n \nElegantly reasoned and lucidly written, this philosophical achievement contains all the wisdom and spirit that distinguished WattsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long career and resonates with us still.\n\nSeries: Vintage\nPaperback: 160 pages\nPublisher: Vintage; 2 edition (February 8, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0307741206\nISBN-13: 978-0307741202\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
