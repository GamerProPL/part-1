It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game.\n\nDisclaimer: Goat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.\n\nFeatures:\nYou can be a goat \nGet points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat \nMILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs, everything else is hilarious and we're keeping it \nIn-game physics that spazz out all the time \nSeriously look at that goat's neck \nYou can be a goat\n\nWhat's in this version : (Updated : Oct 1, 2014)\nFixed matrix goat\nFixed compatibility on some devices\nAdded controls menu option to pause menu\nFixed gamepad issues\nRequired Android O/S : 4.0.3+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:800edc7f457abe114508b063ebd444e831de3da7","amp;dn":"Goat+Simulator+v1.0.8+Android","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"800edc7f457abe114508b063ebd444e831de3da7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,14,220,127,69,122,190,17,69,8,176,99,235,212,68,232,49,222,61,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
