After the 2nd, only the lucky escape. And after the 3rd, only the unlucky survive. After the 4th wave, only one rule applies: trust no one.\n\nNow, itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the dawn of the 5th wave, and on a lonely stretch of highway, Cassie runs from Them. The beings who only look human, who roam the countryside killing anyone they see. Who have scattered EarthÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s last survivors. To stay alone is to stay alive, Cassie believes, until she meets Evan Walker. Beguiling and mysterious, Evan Walker may be CassieÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s only hope for rescuing her brotherÃ¢â‚¬â€or even saving herself. But Cassie must choose: between trust and despair, between defiance and surrender, between life and death. To give up or to get up.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3acf4ad8c0c46e11e45c0f01ebb68dbbe9b89020","amp;dn":"The+5th+Wave+%28The+Fifth+Wave+%231%29+by+Rick+Yancey+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3acf4ad8c0c46e11e45c0f01ebb68dbbe9b89020","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,207,74,216,192,196,110,17,228,92,15,1,235,182,141,187,233,184,144,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
