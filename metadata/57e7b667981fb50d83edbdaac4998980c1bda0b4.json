Records. It was produced by Mike Elizondo and mixed in New York City by noted engineer Andy Wallace. Nightmare is the first Avenged Sevenfold record without James &quot;The Rev&quot; Sullivan performing drums on all the songs due to his death in December 2009; however he did write parts that were used for the final recordings, making this the last album he would write on, The Rev's vocals are still on the album as a tribute to him. Mike Portnoy, from Dream Theater, who performed as the drummer for the album in his place, also played with the band for all their tours through the end of 2010, due to his separation with Dream Theater. They have since hired Arin Ilejay to drum in Rev's place. The album has been certified Gold by the RIAA in the United States. As of August 2013 the album has sold 766,000 copies in the United States.\n\nReleased - July 27, 2010\nRecorded - November 2009 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ April 21, 2010 at The Pass and Phantom Studios\nGenre - Heavy metal, hard rock\nLength - 66:49\nLabel - Warner Bros.
