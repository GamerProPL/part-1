The samurai have no place in this modern society where warriors are less useful than traders. Unemployed, having lost the right to wear the sword, and facing guns and cannons, the samurai will gradually disappear into legend. Kenshin is one of such lost warrior. Once a grand master of the sword he is now a vagabond, wandering the roads of Japan. However, his chivalry and courage will make this one-time mercenary a loved and respected vigilante.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19bbde42892e9d3010614f8f198579b5ca5b9d9b","amp;dn":"Rurouni+Kenshin+%282012%29+BluRay+720p+900Mb+Mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19bbde42892e9d3010614f8f198579b5ca5b9d9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,187,222,66,137,46,157,48,16,97,79,143,25,133,121,181,202,91,157,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
