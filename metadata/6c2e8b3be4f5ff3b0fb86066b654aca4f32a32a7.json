Forbes raves that Creativity, Inc. Ã¢â‚¬Å“just might be the business book ever written.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nCreativity, Inc. is a book for managers who want to lead their employees to new heights, a manual for anyone who strives for originality, and the first-ever, all-access trip into the nerve center of Pixar AnimationÃ¢â‚¬â€into the meetings, postmortems, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“BraintrustÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sessions where some of the most successful films in history are made. It is, at heart, a book about how to build a creative cultureÃ¢â‚¬â€but it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, Ã¢â‚¬Å“an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nFor nearly twenty years, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as the Toy Story trilogy, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, and WALL-E, which have gone on to set box-office records and garner thirty Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really is. Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admiredÃ¢â‚¬â€and so profitable.\n\nAs a young man, Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, where many computer science pioneers got their start, and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led, indirectly, to his founding Pixar with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter in 1986. Nine years later, Toy Story was released, changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s successÃ¢â‚¬â€and in the thirteen movies that followedÃ¢â‚¬â€was the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar, based on philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention, such as:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t strive to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the managerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s job to prevent risks. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the managerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s job to make it safe for others to take them.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The cost of preventing errors is often far greater than the cost of fixing them.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s communication structure should not mirror its organizational structure. Everybody should be able to talk to anybody","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c2e8b3be4f5ff3b0fb86066b654aca4f32a32a7","amp;dn":"Creativity%2C+Inc.+-+Ed+Catmull+and+Amy+Wallace","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c2e8b3be4f5ff3b0fb86066b654aca4f32a32a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,46,139,59,228,245,255,59,15,184,96,102,182,84,172,164,243,42,50,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
