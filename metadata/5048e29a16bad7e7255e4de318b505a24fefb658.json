Key alterations include a revamped transfer and contract system, including better implementation of amateur and youth contracts, and the arrival of loyalty bonuses (you wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need to pay many of those in the Premiership). ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re constantly watching the whole of the football world, and dealing with people inside football, to find out out whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s changing,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Sports Interactive MD, Miles Jacobson. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOne thing people may notice from the screenshots is that the signing on fee isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t there anymore ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been replaced by a loyalty bonus. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fortuitous this has happened just as the news broke that Febregas was going to be paying back Arsenal some of his signing on fee for the next few years, because they paid him a loyalty bonus upfront. The featureset for this game was nailed down in December, but sometimes we go along at the pace of the real-life sport. Life sometimes imitates art!\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures:\n\nTransfers &amp; Contracts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ significant changes to the transfer and contract systems, including loyalty bonuses, better implementation of amateur and youth contracts, an improved transfer centre and the ability to lock areas of the contract negotiation when you arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t prepared to budge.

Manage in that country at the start of the next season- meaning you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to stay in the nations which are chosen by you to be playable at the start of your career.\nTone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a whole new level has been added to team talks and conversations, with the new tone system, which allows you to specify the way you want to say things ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ be as cool as a cucumber by saying things calmly or throw tea cups around by saying things with passion. There are 6 different tones to choose from with specific comments per tone.\nIntelligent Interface ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a new adaptive layout system, which means the higher your screen resolution, the more info is easily at your fingertips.
