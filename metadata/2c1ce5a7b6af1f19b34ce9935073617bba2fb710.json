Use it to compare and merge source code, web pages, XML and other text files with native application performance. Directly open and compare the text from Microsoft Office (Word and Excel), OpenDocument, PDF and RTF files. Compare images and binary files. Synchronize folders. Perform code reviews and audits. Work with folder hierarchies containing thousands of files. Merge integrates with many SCM (version control) systems and other applications.\n\nBenefits\n\nFor legal and publishing professionals: instantly identify every change between different contract or manuscript drafts. Directly open and compare the text from Microsoft Office (Word and Excel), OpenDocument, PDF and RTF files. Copy text from other applications (such as Microsoft Word) and paste it directly into a text comparison window.\nFor software engineers and web developers: compare, understand and combine different source file versions. Work quickly and accurately, whether you are comparing individual files or reconciling entire branches of source code. Use three-way comparison to integrate changes made by you, and those made by a colleague, with a common ancestor version. Synchronize a website with its staging area via FTP using the supplied FTP plugin.\nFor release and quality control managers: compare different source code branches to give total confidence that you know and understand every change made to every file for a specific release. Compare product releases to be certain that only the expected files have been modified. Create an HTML or XML report of changes for audit purposes.\nFor code reviewers and auditors: identify in context every change made between two or three source code hierarchies. Create a standalone HTML or XML report of your findings. Add bookmarks and comments to a file or folder comparison, then save it as a single-file archive for emailing to other team members for review.\nOther users: Whether you are working with multiple revisions of text files or need to keep multiple folder hierarchies in sync (for example, between a desktop and laptop machine), Merge could help save time and reduce errors by helping you to work quickly and accurately.\n\nSystem requirements:\n\nThis release is tested and supported on the following platforms:\nWindows 8 (32-bit and 64-bit)\nWindows 7 SP1 (32-bit and 64-bit)\nWindows XP Professional SP3 (32-bit)\nThe following platforms are also supported and expected to work, but not routinely tested:\nWindows Vista SP2 (32-bit and 64-bit)\nWindows Server 2012\nWindows Server 2008 R2 SP1\nWindows Server 2003 R2 SP2 (requires the MSXML 6 update from Microsoft to be installed)\n\nHomepage: http://www.araxis.com/\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n- Install program.\n- Copy content from crack folder and paste into default installation directory.\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c1ce5a7b6af1f19b34ce9935073617bba2fb710","amp;dn":"Araxis+Merge+Professional+v2013.4296+Incl+Crack+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c1ce5a7b6af1f19b34ce9935073617bba2fb710","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,28,229,167,182,175,31,25,179,76,233,147,80,115,97,123,186,47,183,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
