Thompson. A fast moving, wildly entertaining documentary with an iconic soundtrack, the film addresses the major touchstones in ThompsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€his intense and ill fated relationship with the HellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Angels, his near-successful bid for the office of sheriff in Aspen in 1970, the notorious story behind the landmark Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, his deep involvement in Senator George McGovernÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1972 presidential campaign, and much more. Narrated by Johnny Depp.\n\n\t\n**** THE MOST ABSORBING FILM, FICTION OR NON-FICTION, I HAVE SEEN THIS YEAR. Alex Gibney and collaborators have surpassed even the much honored 'Enron' and 'Taxi to the Dark Side'. GONZO IS A MUST-SEE FOR EVERYONE.&quot; - Andrew Sarris, NY Observer\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“FASCINATING! At his best Hunter Thompson was braver, funnier and more ruthlessly honest than just about any other magazine writer and Ã¢â‚¬ËœGonzoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ confirms his place in the best, most disreputable corner of our literary pantheon.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A.O.
