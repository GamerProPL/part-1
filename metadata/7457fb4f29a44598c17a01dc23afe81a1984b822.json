They are now businessmen and affluent, but have started realising that time is passing by them and they now need to settle down and get married. As luck would have it, they fall in love with the same girl, Chandni (Ankita Shrivastava) and her unscruplous mother Maharani (Dimple Kapadia). Just as things are getting complicated, Dr. Ghungaroo (Paresh Rawal, Uday's father, pops up with a daughter Ranjana (Shruti Haasan) and insist that Ranjana must be married first. In yet another complication, Ranjana has a beau Ajju (John Abraham), who is really the daughter of Dr. Ghungaroo's third wife from an earlier marriage. But when everyone agrees that Ajju and Ranjana are made for each other, Uday and Majnu find out that Ajju is a gangster from the underworld and so unfit to be Rajana's husband. So they go to Wanted Bhai (Naseeruddin)for help. Unfortunately for them Wanted Bhai is the biggest criminal of the lot. So we are in a situation where everyone is chasing everyone else. Who gets to marry Ranjana is the real story..\n\nComments:\nThis is a sequel to the original 2007 film Wanted, which was zany but enjoyable. The plot is basically the same witha few new jokes, but to the credit of Director Anees Bamzai, the sequel is entertaining as well.\n\nBut first a caveat. If you want to watch this film, the Director demands that you leave logic, sense and anything similar behind. Just surrender yourself to the crazy plot and the dialogues and their delivery and you will be fine. Apply logic or commonsense and you will simply go insane!\n\nHaving said that, you can spend 2Ã‚Â½ hours in complete colourful oblivion watching this movie, not the least because of the comic delivery and chemistry of Anil Kapoor and Nana Patekar. Others like Paresh Rawal chip in too, with the surprising exception of Naseeuddin, who just hams his way through. The two young ladies, Ankita and Shruti are good eye-candy and so is Dimple for those who like a little mature looks.\n\nThe film has some slick editing and some very nice action sequences. Music is catchy, but not very memorable. Cinematography, particularly in the action sequences inspires awe. In fact it has everything for a person who wants to simply sit back and forget the world for 2Ã‚Â½ hours.\n\nEverything other than logic, that is..\n\n\nUploader's Notes:\nThis is a rip from a very poor quality DVD Screener. The colours were completely awry, there was an ugly yellow tinge througout the movie and above all there was a whole lot of camera flare across the entire clip and random variation of luma and chroma. We have tried to clean up the movie to the extent we could. The result is there for you to see. Just keep in mind that this is not a full DVD rip. It is a rip from a screener, brought to you exclusively by DDR.\n\nThis is a 10-bit HEVC rip that uses the latest x.265 codec. The higher compressibility of the 10-bit codec has allowed us to reduce the size to just 1-CD with no compromise on quality.\n\nBe aware that this rip (and all HEVC rips) will not play on any stand-alone device. You can only watch this on a computer. Be sure that you have the latest versions of VLC or Media Player Classic or SMPlayer. Earlier versions may not work\n\nIMDB Link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3159708/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3159708/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSample (2 minutes): Download from here\n\nSeeding at 1 GBPS+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7457fb4f29a44598c17a01dc23afe81a1984b822","amp;dn":"Welcome.Back-DesiSCR.Rip-HEVC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7457fb4f29a44598c17a01dc23afe81a1984b822","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,87,251,79,41,164,69,152,193,122,1,220,35,175,232,26,25,132,184,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
