This way IsoBuster can access data that Windows can't.\nIsoBuster also supports a wide range of image file formats, such as: *.DAO, *.TAO, *.ISO, *.BIN, *.IMG, *.CIF, *.FCD, *.NRG, *.GCD, *.P01, *.C2D, .CUE, \n*.CD, *.GI and more ... It uses several retry-mechanisms to aid you in getting the data, even if Windows is not able to do so. It is a very useful and easy to use program.\n\n\nWhat's new in IsoBuster 3.3 Build 3.3.0.0:\n(December 12th, 2013)\n\n-Fixed obscure and rare EEFFACE error while selecting objects","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d71ef3de8a7a7a05603939679c91d404133c023","amp;dn":"IsoBuster+PRO+3.3+Build+3.3.0.0+Final+%2B+Key+-+CORE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d71ef3de8a7a7a05603939679c91d404133c023","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,113,239,61,232,167,167,160,86,3,147,150,121,201,29,64,65,51,192,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
