It will be their first for new label Yebo Music. Frontman Kip Berman says the new record will not be a continuation of Belong's big, uber-'90s sound: I didn't want to make Belonger. This album was a chance to step back from that universal style of songwriting to something that was far more personal, more in keeping with my original ideals. I wanted the music to be joyful and full of light, even if the subjects were often dark.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b98afb989eaa125937f7ce64a2b316eb9550fea5","amp;dn":"The+Pains+of+Being+Pure+at+Heart+-+Days+of+Abandon+320%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b98afb989eaa125937f7ce64a2b316eb9550fea5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,138,251,152,158,170,18,89,55,247,206,100,162,179,22,235,149,80,254,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
