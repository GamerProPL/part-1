When he was ten, he was already playing the keyboard and drums in bars and hotels. Darren Hayes' show business experience extended no further than his involvement in many school plays. When Jones and the band he'd started with his brothers advertised for a singer, the inexperienced but enthusiastic Hayes was the only hopeful to answer. He wasn't what was needed for a covers band playing the Gold Coast resort area of Queensland, but Hayes inspired a different flame in Jones and the pair broke away to start writing original songs.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.I Want You\n02.To The Moon And Back\n03.Truly Madly Deeply\n04.I'll Be He Was Cool\n05.Fire Inside The Man\n06.Break Me Shake Me\n07.This Side Of Me\n08.Universe\n09.Memories Are Designed To Fade\n10.All Around Me\n11.Santa Monica\n12.Tears Of Pearls\n13.A Thousand Words\n14.Promises\n15.Carry On Dancing\n16.Mine\n17.Love Can Move You\n18.Violet\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38c71206a0bbb9246e32173247dfe70ea90e1db3","amp;dn":"Savage+Garden+-+Greatest+Hits+%282004%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38c71206a0bbb9246e32173247dfe70ea90e1db3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,199,18,6,160,187,185,36,110,50,23,50,71,223,231,14,169,14,29,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
