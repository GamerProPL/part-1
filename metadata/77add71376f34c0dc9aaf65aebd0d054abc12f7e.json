This torrent fixes that...  :)\n\nOne disc per .mp4 file, and all the content in each video is organized just like how it would play on the DVD.\n\nIf you are having any problems playing it, use VLC Media Player, and you are good to go.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Art of the Dynamic Handgun is a 4-disc DVD set featuring over\nseven hours of actual live fire class instruction and additional\ninstructional material.\n\nUsing a diverse group of beginner, intermediate, and advanced\nstudents, instructors Travis Haley and Chris Costa guide the class\nfrom the fundamentals of handgun operation, to problem solving, and\nthrough complex real-life scenarios. This progression from basic to\nadvanced weapon manipulation pushes students of all skill levels to\ntheir failure points, illustrating how even the best shooters can\nadvance and excel.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77add71376f34c0dc9aaf65aebd0d054abc12f7e","amp;dn":"Magpul+Dynamics-+The+Art+of+the+Dynamic+Handgun+%28.mp4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77add71376f34c0dc9aaf65aebd0d054abc12f7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,173,215,19,118,243,76,13,201,170,246,90,235,208,208,84,171,193,47,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
