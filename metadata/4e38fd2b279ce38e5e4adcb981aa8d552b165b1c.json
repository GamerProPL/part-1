Today they unveil the Lazaretto ULTRA LP:\n\n- 180 gram vinyl\n- 2 vinyl-only hidden tracks hidden beneath the center labels\n- 1 hidden track plays at 78 RPM, one plays at 45 RPM, making this a 3-speed record\n- Side A plays from the outside in\n- Dual-groove technology: plays an electric or acoustic intro for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Just One DrinkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ depending on where needle is dropped. The grooves meet for the body of the song.\n- Matte finish on Side B, giving the appearance of an un-played 78 RPM record\n- Both sides end with locked grooves\n- Vinyl pressed in seldom-used flat-edged format\n- Dead wax area on Side A contains a hand-etched hologram by Tristan Duke of Infinity Light Science, the first of its kind on a vinyl record\n- Absolutely zero compression used during recording, mixing and mastering\n- Different running order from the CD/digital version\n- LP utilizes some mixes different from those used on CD and digital version\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e38fd2b279ce38e5e4adcb981aa8d552b165b1c","amp;dn":"Jack+White+-+Lazaretto+ULTRA+LP+%282014%29+Third+Man+Records+MP3VBR+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e38fd2b279ce38e5e4adcb981aa8d552b165b1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,56,253,43,39,156,227,142,94,74,220,185,129,170,141,85,43,22,91,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
