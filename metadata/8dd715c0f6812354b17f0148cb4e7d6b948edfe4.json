Unlike Miles, who pressed ahead relentlessly and never looked back until near the very end, Hancock has cut a zigzagging forward path, shuttling between almost every development in electronic and acoustic jazz and R&amp;B over the last third of the 20th century and into the 21st. Though grounded in Bill Evans and able to absorb blues, funk, gospel, and even modern classical influences, Hancock's piano and keyboard voices are entirely his own, with their own urbane harmonic and complex, earthy rhythmic signatures -- and young pianists cop his licks constantly. Having studied engineering and professing to love gadgets and buttons, Hancock was perfectly suited for the electronic age; he was one of the earliest champions of the Rhodes electric piano and Hohner clavinet, and would field an ever-growing collection of synthesizers and computers on his electric dates. Yet his love for the grand piano never waned, and despite his peripatetic activities all around the musical map, his piano style continued to evolve into tougher, ever more complex forms. He is as much at home trading riffs with a smoking funk band as he is communing with a world-class post-bop rhythm section -- and that drives purists on both sides of the fence up the wall. \n\nGenre................: Jazz\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Columbia/Legacy\nIncluded.............: Covers, Log, Cue\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Watermelon Man\n02.'Round Midnight\n03.Cantaloupe Island\n04.Maiden Voyage\n05.Circle\n06.The Sorcerer\n07.Tell Me A Bedtime Story\n08.Hidden Shadows\n09.Chameleon\n10.Joanna's Theme\n\nCD2\n\n01.Butterfly\n02.People Music\n03.Milestones\n04.4 A.M.\n05.Come Running To Me\n06.Finger Painting\n07.Stars In Your Eyes\n08.Rockit\n09.St. Louis Blues\n10.Manhattan\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dd715c0f6812354b17f0148cb4e7d6b948edfe4","amp;dn":"Herbie+Hancock+-+The+Essential+%282006%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dd715c0f6812354b17f0148cb4e7d6b948edfe4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,215,21,192,246,129,35,84,177,127,1,72,203,78,125,107,148,142,223,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
