Furious, Sir Richard responded by suing Bisset for criminal conversation and demanding a record Ã‚Â£20,000 for the damage done to his property - Lady Worsley. While Seymour and Bisset hid out in a London hotel, Sir Richard and his lawyers set about proving his wife's infidelity through a series of devious schemes. When the case came to court, Sir Richard lied about his relationship with Seymour, painting a perfect picture of their marriage and persuading others to do the same. Bisset looked sure to be facing penury and prison until Seymour devised a bold plan. To save her lover from ruin, she disclosed a shocking secret - one that astounded the court, put her reputation in jeopardy and turned the trial into the greatest sex scandal of the eighteenth century","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dcf0ef96fa3ffa8744a977bf067e6fff0cf2f0e","amp;dn":"The+Scandalous+Lady+W+EN+SUBS+x264+720p+WEBRIP+%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dcf0ef96fa3ffa8744a977bf067e6fff0cf2f0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,207,14,249,111,163,255,168,116,74,151,123,240,103,230,255,240,207,47,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
