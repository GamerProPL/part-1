When I discovered this cd and starting playing it, I was overwhelmed with appreciation - not only are these two renditions exceptional, but most of the other music on the cd is just as superb. This is a cd I listen to hours on end - both Gary's voice and the accompaniment penetrate deep into one's soul....and are indeed the musical equivalent of the perfect massage. It is one of my top five favorites....and the best blues music I've ever heard. Highest recommendations!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b084c3164ae9f0a35432ebba2e31fe09a82cf20","amp;dn":"Gary+Moore+-+Ballads+%26amp%3B+Blues+1982-1994+320cbr+Guitar+Blues+R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b084c3164ae9f0a35432ebba2e31fe09a82cf20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,8,76,49,100,174,159,10,53,67,46,187,162,227,31,224,154,130,207,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
