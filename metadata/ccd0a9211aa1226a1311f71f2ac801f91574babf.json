There is a civil war going on and Jordan who has joined up on the side that appeals most to idealists of that era -- like Ernest Hemingway and his friends -- has been given a high-risk assignment up in the mountains. He awaits the right time to blow up a bridge in a cave. Pilar, who is in charge there, has an ability to foretell the future. And so that night she encourages Maria, a young girl ravaged by enemy soldiers, to join Jordan who has decided to spend the night under the stars. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccd0a9211aa1226a1311f71f2ac801f91574babf","amp;dn":"For+Whom+the+Bell+Tolls+%281943%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccd0a9211aa1226a1311f71f2ac801f91574babf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,208,169,33,26,161,34,106,19,17,247,31,42,200,1,249,21,116,186,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
