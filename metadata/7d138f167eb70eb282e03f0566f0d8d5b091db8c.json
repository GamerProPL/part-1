The story was adapted by Andrew Davies. \n\nThe antihero of House of Cards is a fictional Conservative Chief Whip, Francis Urquhart played by Ian Richardson. The plot follows his amoral and manipulative scheme to become leader of the governing party, and hence Prime Minister of the UK.\n\nIt appears that Dobbs did not envisage writing the second and third books. The screenplay of the BBC's dramatisation of House of Cards had to differ from the book in order to allow future series. Dobbs wrote two following books To Play the King and The Final Cut which were televised in 1993 and 1995 respectively.\n\nHouse of Cards draws heavily from Shakespeare's Macbeth and Richard III, both of which examine issues of power, unbridled ambition and corruption. Richardson said he based his performance of the scheming Francis Urquhart on the way Shakespeare portrayed Richard III.\n\nFrequently during the drama, Urquhart talks through the camera to the audience, breaking the fourth wall. The drama also introduced and popularised the phrase: 'You may very well think that; I couldn't possibly comment'. It was used by Urquhart whenever he could not be seen to agree with a question, with the emphasis on either the 'I' or the 'possibly' depending on the situation. The phrase was even quoted in the House of Commons following the series.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d138f167eb70eb282e03f0566f0d8d5b091db8c","amp;dn":"House+of+Cards+%28BBC+-+Complete+Part+3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d138f167eb70eb282e03f0566f0d8d5b091db8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,19,143,22,126,183,14,178,130,224,63,5,102,240,216,213,176,145,219,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
