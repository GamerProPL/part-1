Knuth is known throughout the world for his pioneering work on algorithms and programming techniques, for his invention of the TEX and METAFONT systems for computer typesetting, and for his prolific and influential writing (26 books, 161 papers). Professor Emeritus of The Art of Computer Programming at Stanford University, he currently devotes full time to the completion of his seminal multivolume series on classical computer science, begun in 1962 when he was a graduate student at California Institute of Technology. Professor Knuth is the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including the ACM Turing Award, the Medal of Science presented by President Carter, the AMS Steele Prize for expository writing, and, in November, 1996, the prestigious Kyoto Prize for advanced technology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa9f1628041772c32cb86b11492dbb9dd91bc04c","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Computer+Programming+%28vol.+1-3%29+%5BePub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa9f1628041772c32cb86b11492dbb9dd91bc04c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,159,22,40,4,23,114,195,44,184,107,17,73,45,187,157,217,27,192,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
