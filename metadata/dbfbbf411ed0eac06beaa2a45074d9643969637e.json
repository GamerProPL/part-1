Carter, having topped records for both physical CD's and iTunes. \n\nTo save some space and bandwidth, added Young Money artist such as Drake, Nicki Minaj, Tyga and the newly signed T-Pain.\nIt's unfortunate that Andre 3000 is not credited on Track 08 on Tha Carter IV. Shame on you iTunes. Also included some digital booklets, and singles from the upcoming album Take Care and Careless World from Drake and Tyga respectively. For some reasons, Track 12 and 13 from I Am Not A Human Being will not appear on iTunes. To order to show in iTunes, you need to add it each file seperately: \n\n(1) Go to file\n(2) Add File to Library\n(3) Find Track 12 and 13 from I Am Not A Human Being.\n\nThe whole album should be 133.1MB not 112.7MB\n\n\nBy the way Lights Out is not included because iTunes doesn't have it.\n\nAnyways, Happy Belated Birthday Dwayne Carter Jr. (September 27, 1982) and Happy 25th Birthday Drizzy Drake. Remember to buy Drake's new album Take Care - November 15, 2011!\n\n\nYMCMB\n\n\n\n\n\n-------[Settings]---------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist: Lil Wayne | Drake | Nicki Minaj | T-Pain | Tyga | Young Money\nGnere: Hip-Hop/Rap\nContent: EXPLICIT\nEncoded by: theLEAK\nCopyright: theLEAK\nYears Active: '90s, '00s, '10s\nCountry: USA\nSource: iTunes US | GB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbfbbf411ed0eac06beaa2a45074d9643969637e","amp;dn":"Lil+Wayne+Complete+Discography+%281999-2011%29+%5BiTunes+Edition%5D%5BtL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbfbbf411ed0eac06beaa2a45074d9643969637e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,251,191,65,30,208,234,192,107,234,162,164,80,116,217,100,57,105,99,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
