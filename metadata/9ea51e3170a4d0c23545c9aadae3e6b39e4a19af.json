The graphics prepared in ChemDraw Ultra insures a professional and neat appearance.\n\nChemDraw Ultra allows you to import a variety of image formats that may be edited or modified as needed, including CML, GIF, BMP, JPEG, ISIS, MDL, TIFF and Galactic and Jcamp spectra files. This capability of ChemDraw avoids having to create and import or export new images from or to several different graphics systems in order to create or to edit an existing drawing.\n\nSystem Requirements:Mac OS X 10.4 PowerPC, Mac OS X 10.4 Intel, Mac OS X 10.5 PowerPC/Intel;\n\nApplications Features\n\n    ChemDraw Ultra 12.0\n    ActiveX Edit in ChemDraw\n    Arrows Tool\n    Chem3D HotLink\n    Chemical File Format\n    Chemical Warnings\n    ChemNMR User Proton Shift Database\n    CLogP\n    Custom Templates &amp; Nicknames\n    Database HotLink\n    Expand Generic Structure\n    Floating Character Map\n    Floating Periodic Table\n    Freehand Drawing Tool\n    High Color Documents and Templates\n    I/Draw Mode\n    ISIS-style Data SGroups\n    LabArt\n    Mass &amp; Other Fragmentation Tools\n    MS Office Integration\n    Multi-Page Docs\n    Online Menu\n    Polymer Draw\n    Properties HotLink\n    Relative Stereochemistry\n    Rotation about Arbitrary Centers\n    Sequence Tool\n    Stereochemistry\n    Stoichiometry Grid\n    Structure CleanUp\n    Structure Perspective Tool\n    TLC Plate Tool\n    tPSA\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ea51e3170a4d0c23545c9aadae3e6b39e4a19af","amp;dn":"ChemDraw.Ultra.v12.0.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ea51e3170a4d0c23545c9aadae3e6b39e4a19af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,165,30,49,112,164,208,194,53,69,201,170,218,227,230,179,158,74,25,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
