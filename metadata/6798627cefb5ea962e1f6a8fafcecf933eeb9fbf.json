No one can  be  seen  around,\r\nbut you soon start to find the bodies of your  dead\r\ncrewmen. The ship  is  adrift,  and  whoever  -  or\r\nwhatever - killed your crewmates is probably  still\r\naround.\r\n\r\nSyndrome is a  sci-fi  survival  horror  game  that\r\ntakes place aboard the &quot;Valkenburg&quot;, an exploration\r\nand science ship equipped with  the  most  advanced\r\nsystems in the Novacore fleet.\r\n\r\nYou need to find out what happened to your  crewmen\r\nand do whatever you can to survive this  nightmare.\r\nThe enemies are powerful and numerous, which  means\r\nthat  stealth  and  evasion  are  often  the   best\r\nstrategy. You'll find weapons aboard the ship,  but\r\nammo is scarce and should be wisely spent.\r\n\r\n1- Unpack, burn or mount\r\n2- Install the game\r\n3- Copy the cracked content from PROPHET dir\r\n4- Go To Hell!\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nThe game version is v1.03f.\r\nFiles on Steam for Windows version of this game\r\n(for all languages) have almost 67,5GB.
