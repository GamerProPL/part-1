Komeda)\nCINEMATOGRAPHER: Jerzy Lipman (B&amp;W)\nCAST:Leon Niemczyk, Jolanta Umecka, Zygmunt Malanowicz\nSTUDIO/PRODUCER: Kamera-Film\nGENRE: Drama\n\n\nSynopsis:\n\nAn attractive young woman, Christine, takes the wheel of a car belonging to her \npartner Andrzej, a sports columnist. While he criticizes her driving skills, a \nreckless student leaps out in front of the car. Andrzej gives the student a ride \nand invites him to accompany them on their yacht trip. Attracted to Christine, \nthe student becomes increasingly clumsy. He spends his time jabbing the point of \na pocket knife rapidly between the fingers of his other hand. Andrzek argues \nwith the student, who topples overboard, vanishing into the lake. Andrzej dives \nin to save him, though he fails to find the student and swims ashore. Despite an \nearlier claim that he couldn&amp;#039;t swim, the student manages to hide behind the \nnearest buoy.  Written by alfiehitchie \n\n\nTrivia:\n\n    * Roman Polanski had intended to take on the role of the young hitchhiker \nhimself, but Jerzy Bossak, head of the Polish film unit KAMERA (under whose \nauspices the film was made), turned him down because he didn&amp;#039;t consider the \ndirector attractive enough. The character&amp;#039;s voice, however, is Polanski&amp;#039;s, who \nlater dubbed the part over. Zygmunt Malanowicz had a strong, developed, bass \nvoice, which was quite inappropriate for the character.\n\n    * Co-screenwriter Jerzy Skolimowski also was interested in playing the young \nhitchhiker&amp;#039;s part.\n\n    * Initially, Polanski wanted to make a criminal story about a couple which \ntakes a young hitchhiker to a boat trip, and at the end the boy dies in \nmysterious circumstances. In his version the trip was about a week long a \ninvolved some other characters. It was Jerzy Skolimowski who proposed to shorten \nit to one day and limit the number of characters. The final script was created \nin only three, four days by Polanski, Skolimowski and Jakub Goldberg in \nPolanski&amp;#039;s apartment. While writing the script they were playing the dialogue, \nchanging the roles all the time.\n\n    * The boat used in the movie is rumored to be a former property of Hermann \nGoering, the Nazi party member and a friend of Adolf Hitler, who used to spend \nsummer holidays in the palace in Sztynort neighboring the filming locations. \nSunk during World War II in the Mazurian Lakes, it was restored and is -- up to \npresent date -- owned by Almatur Travel Agency located in Gizycko, Poland, very \npopular in Polish showbiz-related circles. The real name of the boat is &quot;Rekin&quot; \n(&quot;The Shark&quot;).\n\n    * During one of top mast shots, the cameramen Jerzy Lipman was tied to the \nmast and hold a camera. Although the wind was not strong, the mast swung and the \ncamera was heavy, so it was very difficult to take a good shot. All the time the \ndirector Roman Polanski was very excited about the shot and kept asking how it \nwas going. Lipman got very angry and said &quot;Fuck! It is fucking beautiful!&quot; \nand... dropped the camera to the water. He had forgotten to attach it with the \nsafety cable. The Arriflex camera couldn&amp;#039;t be found by the divers and still lies \nsomewhere in the lake.\n\n    * The first scene in the film shows Andrzej and Krystyna driving a car. As \nshooting from the platform in front of the car was not yet available, the crew \nwas tied to the car, standing on its mask. To get the proper light effects, they \nheld a blanket with a small hole for the camera. Leon Niemczyk (Andrzej) was \nreally driving this car quite fast (this was crucial to this scene), but he \ncouldn&amp;#039;t see anything. He drove the car using the tops of the trees to imagine \nwhere the road is.\n\n    * After the movie became known in US, Polanski was given a proposal to \nremake the film in English with some known Hollywood actors (rumors talk about \nSpencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor), but he turned it down as he didn&amp;#039;t want to \n&quot;repeat himself&quot;.\n\n    * The couple&amp;#039;s car, seen in the opening and closing sequences, was initially \nsupposed to be a Mercedes, but this was replaced with a Peugeot during filming \nto avoid political controversy. (The more expensive car was perceived as an icon \nof Western luxury and decadence). During the shots, a prominent party member \narrived at the plan in the newest model of Mercedes. He was invited by the whole \ncrew with peals of laughter.\n\n    * Forms part of a loose trilogy of films based around a psychological \nmÃƒÅ¡nage-Ãƒâ€œ-trois with _Cul-de-Sac (1966)_ and Death and the Maiden (1994). All \nthree films feature a couple who&amp;#039;s lives are turned upside down by an outside \ncharacter.\n\n    * The first Polish film to be nominated for a Foreign Language Oscar.\n\n    * This was Roman Polanski&amp;#039;s directorial debut, and the only film he ever \nmade in his native Poland. Shortly after the film was released, Polanski \nemigrated to France (then to England, and then to the US), where he established \nhis international fame.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Personal Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy releases so far... personal rips from original DVDs, looking for quality.\nWhenever there&amp;#039;s an AC3 file, there&amp;#039;s 99% possibilities this is the directly\nripped audio track from the DVD, untouched.\n\nThey&amp;#039;re usually uploaded in TPB, Mininova and TorrentBox, but feel free to share \nthem on edonkey networks or in any way you want.
