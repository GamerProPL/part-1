He is sometimes called &quot;the Chekhov of the suburbs&quot;.  His fiction is mostly set in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the Westchester suburbs, old New England villages based on various South Shore towns around Quincy, Massachusetts, where he was born, and Italy, especially Rome.\n\nTHE STORIES OF JOHN CHEEVER won the 1979 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and a National Book Critics Circle Award, and its first paperback edition won a 1981 National Book Award.  He also wrote four novels, comprising THE WAPSHOT CHRONICLE (National Book Award, 1958), THE WAPSHOT SCANDAL (William Dean Howells Medal, 1965), BULLET PARK (1969), FALCONER (1977), and a novella OH WHAT A PARADISE IT SEEMS (1982).\n\nHis main themes include the duality of human nature: sometimes dramatized as the disparity between a character's decorous social persona and inner corruption, and sometimes as a conflict between two characters (often brothers) who embody the salient aspects of both -- light and dark, flesh and spirit.  Many of his works also express a nostalgia for a vanishing way of life (as evoked by the mythical St. Botolphs in the Wapshot novels), characterized by abiding cultural traditions and a profound sense of community, as opposed to the alienating nomadism of modern suburbia.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format:\n\n* BULLET PARK (Knopf, 1969)\n\n* FALCONER (Knopf, 1977)\n\n* OH WHAT A PARADISE IT SEEMS (Knopf, 1982)\n\n* THE STORIES OF JOHN CHEEVER (Knopf, 1982)\n\n* THE WAPSHOT CHRONICLE (1957; Vintage, 2010)\n\n* THE WAPSHOT SCANDAL (1964; Vintage, 2003)\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
