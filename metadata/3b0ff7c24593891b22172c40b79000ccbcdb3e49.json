It continues to be innovative while teaching students in a clear, unbiased way. The 19th Edition builds upon the tradition of leadership by sticking to 3 main goals: Help the beginning student master the principles essential for understanding the \neconomizing problem, specific economic issues, and the policy alternatives; help the student understand and apply the economic perspective and reason accurately and objectively about economic matters; and promote a lasting student interest in economics and the economy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b0ff7c24593891b22172c40b79000ccbcdb3e49","amp;dn":"Macroeconomics+19th+Edition-+McConnell%2C+Brue%2C+Flynn+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b0ff7c24593891b22172c40b79000ccbcdb3e49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,15,247,194,69,147,137,27,34,23,44,64,183,144,0,204,188,219,62,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
