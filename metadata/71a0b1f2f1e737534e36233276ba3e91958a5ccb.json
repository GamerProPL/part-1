In between, they became one of the top-tier acts on a label with no shortage of talent, ranking with the Temptations and the Supremes as Motown's most consistent hitmakers. Where many other R&amp;B vocal groups spotlighted a tenor-range lead singer, the Four Tops were fronted by deep-voiced Levi Stubbs, who never cut a solo record outside of the group. Stubbs had all the grit of a pleading, wailing, gospel-trained soul belter, but at the same time, the Tops' creamy harmonies were smooth enough for Motown's radio-friendly pop-soul productions. From 1964-1967, the Four Tops recorded some of the Holland-Dozier-Holland team's greatest compositions, including &quot;Reach Out, I'll Be There,&quot; &quot;I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch),&quot; &quot;Standing in the Shadows of Love,&quot; &quot;Bernadette,&quot; and &quot;Baby I Need Your Loving.&quot; The group's fortunes took a downturn when their chief source of material left the label, but they enjoyed a renaissance in the early '70s, which saw them switching to the ABC-Dunhill imprint. Regardless of commercial fortunes, they kept on performing and touring, scoring the occasional comeback hit.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tR&amp;B\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Reach Out (I'll Be There)\n02.Standing In The Shadows Of Love\n03.Bernadette\n04.Ask The Lonely\n05.Baby I Need Your Loving\n06.Without The One You Love (Life's Not Worthwhile)\n07.It's The Same Old Song\n08.Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever\n09.I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch)\n10.Something About You\n11.I Got A Feeling\n12.I'm In A Different World\n13.Walk Away Renee\n14.What Is A Man\n15.A Simple Game\n16.Still Water (Love)\n17.(It's The Way) Nature Planned It\n18.It's All In The Game\n19.You Keep Running Away\n20.If You Don't Want My Love\n21.7-Rooms Of Gloom\n22.I'll Turn To Stone\n23.Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)\n24.Sad Souvenirs\n25.Yesterday's Dreams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n               ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71a0b1f2f1e737534e36233276ba3e91958a5ccb","amp;dn":"The+Four+Tops+-+The+Ultimate+Collection++%281997%29+MP3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71a0b1f2f1e737534e36233276ba3e91958a5ccb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,160,177,242,241,231,55,83,78,54,35,50,118,186,62,145,149,138,92,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
