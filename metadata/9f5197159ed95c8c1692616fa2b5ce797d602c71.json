The player controls one of several taxi drivers in a fictional city, looking for fares and then taking them to their destination in the fastest time possible. The player must perform this while time still remains on an overall gameplay clock. Passengers looking for rides are indicated by an overhead marker that is colored to represent the distance to their intended destination. The color marker ranges from red indicating short trips, to yellow for intermediate distances, and to green indicating long ones. When a passenger is picked up, the player is awarded additional time on the countdown time. Furthermore, a second countdown timer is started, representing how quickly the passenger needs to be at their destination. While a passenger is in the taxi, a large green arrow is shown on the player&amp;#039;s HUD that points in the general direction of the passenger&amp;#039;s destination to help guide the player through the map.[5]\n\nThe player can use special &quot;crazy stunt&quot; moves such as drifts, jumps, and near-misses, and consecutive combos of these, to earn extra money from the passenger during the trip. If the destination is reached in time, the player is paid based on distance driven with a possible time bonus based on how quickly the destination was reached. If the passenger&amp;#039;s countdown drops to zero, they will exit the taxi and the player will be required to look for another fare. The game continues in this mode as long as time remains on the clock. Once the clock reaches zero, the game is over, and the player is ranked and rated based on the total earned.[5]\n\nUnlike other arcade games, the player cannot continue from where the previous game ended. The game cannot be played indefinitely; while there are hundreds of potential passengers to pick up and deliver, there are only a limited number of fares in the game. The various passengers scattered throughout the city will randomly appear and disappear throughout the game, but once one is picked up that passenger is unavailable for the rest of that game. The core gameplay in the series has been praised as being &quot;deceptively complex&quot;;[2][5] as stated by the IGN staff for their review of the Dreamcast version of Crazy Taxi:[2]ÃƒÂ¢??\tAs you progress through the game&amp;#039;s ratings scale by picking up and delivering passengers as quickly as possible, you will slowly but surely realize that there is much more to the game than getting from point a to b.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f5197159ed95c8c1692616fa2b5ce797d602c71","amp;dn":"Crazy+Taxi+PC+Full+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f5197159ed95c8c1692616fa2b5ce797d602c71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,81,151,21,158,217,92,140,22,146,97,111,162,181,206,121,125,96,44,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
