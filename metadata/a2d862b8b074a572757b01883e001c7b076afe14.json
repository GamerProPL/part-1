Jimmy and his guests try to get to the bottom of what laughter is, why we enjoy it so much and what, if anything, it has to do with comedy.\r\nBetween them, and with the help of contributions from other scientists on film, Jimmy and guests discover that laughter is much older than our species, and may well have contributed to making us human.\r\nWith professors Sophie Scott, Robin Dunbar and Peter McGraw.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3a/The-Science-of-Laughter-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e2/The-Science-of-Laughter-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d1/The-Science-of-Laughter-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ec/The-Science-of-Laughter-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/60/The-Science-of-Laughter-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/43/The-Science-of-Laughter-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/94/The-Science-of-Laughter-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0c/The-Science-of-Laughter-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c5/The-Science-of-Laughter-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~1735Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~125Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 775 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07vxkbv","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2d862b8b074a572757b01883e001c7b076afe14","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+2016+The+Science+of+Laughter+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2d862b8b074a572757b01883e001c7b076afe14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,216,98,184,176,116,165,114,117,123,1,136,62,0,28,123,7,106,254,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
