He is, in turn, captain of industry, assassin, beggar, monster, family man... He seems to be playing roles, plunging headlong into each part - but where are the cameras? Monsieur Oscar is alone, accompanied only by CÃƒÂ©line, the slender blonde woman behind the wheel of the vast engine that transports him through and around Paris. He's like a conscientious assassin moving from hit to hit. In pursuit of the beautiful gesture, the mysterious driving force, the women and the ghosts of past lives. But where is his true home, his family, his rest?\n\nBROUGHT TO YOU BY * CLOWNSEC * HONK *","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dc2ffb3fa067c9f91208cb98a178639996fa390","amp;dn":"Holy+Motors+%5BENG+SUB%5D+%282012%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+CLOWNSEC+%28Phreaky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dc2ffb3fa067c9f91208cb98a178639996fa390","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,194,255,179,250,6,124,159,145,32,140,185,138,23,134,57,153,111,163,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
