He reveals how he created his most indelible comedic characters, among them the manic man-child Ed Grimley, the slimy corporate lawyer Nathan Thurm, and the bizarrely insensitive interviewer Jiminy Glick. Throughout, Short freely shares the spotlight with friends, colleagues, and collaborators, including Steve Martin, Tom Hanks, Gilda Radner, Mel Brooks, Nora Ephron, Eugene Levy, Catherine OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Hara, Paul Shaffer, and David Letterman.\n\nBut there is another side to Short's life that he has long kept private. He lost his eldest brother and both of his parents by the time he turned 20, and, more recently, he lost his wife of 30 years to cancer. In I Must Say, Short talks for the first time about the pain that these losses inflicted and the upbeat life philosophy that has kept him resilient and carried him through. In the grand tradition of comedy legends, Martin Short offers a show business memoir densely populated with boldface names and rife with re-tellable tales: a hugely entertaining yet surprisingly moving self-portrait that will keep you laughing - and crying - from the first page to the last.\n\nSpecial Lyrics for &quot;It's The Most Wonderful Show of the Year&quot; and &quot;Picture-Perfect Christmas In The Palisades&quot; by Martin Short, Marc Shaiman, and Scott Wittman; Special Lyrics for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Marty Throws a Party Just to Sing&quot; by Marc Shaiman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:420f41cd72de50e8acc0c1555e5edb06b54657ee","amp;dn":"I+Must+Say%3A+My+Life+as+a+Humble+Comedy+Legend+-+Martin+Short+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"420f41cd72de50e8acc0c1555e5edb06b54657ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,15,65,205,114,222,80,232,172,192,193,85,94,94,219,6,181,70,87,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
