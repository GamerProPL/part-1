With 'Tonight: Franz Ferdinand', the band are seen to incorporate more disparate influences such as Jamaican dub and elements of electronica. What remains of the old Franz Ferdinand is their knack for locating a danceable rhythm and their gentle, deadpan humour. The choice of Dan Carey as producer is in keeping with this new direction, the past credits of whose include CSS and Hot Chip.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfcc11784b43cdbb39ad21568c46f22eef6e3471","amp;dn":"Franz+Ferdinand+-+Tonight%3A+Franz+Ferdinand+%5Bmp3-vbr-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfcc11784b43cdbb39ad21568c46f22eef6e3471","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,204,17,120,75,67,205,187,57,173,33,86,140,70,242,46,239,110,52,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
