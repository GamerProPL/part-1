Although she came on like an arena rocker with her power chords, tough sexuality, and powerful vocals, her music was straight pop/rock underneath all the bluster. Born Patricia Andrzejewski on January 10, 1953, in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, the singer was raised in the nearby town of Lindenhurst on Long Island, NY. Benatar began singing regularly in the New York City area by the '70s, where she was discovered at the Catch a Rising Star club and signed by Chrysalis Records. Backed by a stellar band led by guitarist Neil Geraldo (who the singer would later marry) that provided the perfect accompaniment that was able to effortlessly alternate between rockers and ballads. Benatar quickly established herself as one of rock's top vocalists, scoring a hit right of the bat with her debut album, 1979's In the Heat of the Night, which spawned such radio favorites as &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; and &quot;I Need a Lover&quot; (the latter of which was written by a then-unknown John Mellencamp).\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Heartbreaker\n02.We Live For Love\n03.Hit Me With Your Best Shot\n04.Hell Is For Children\n05.Treat Me Right\n06.You Better Run\n07.Fire And Ice\n08.Promises In The Dark\n09.Precious Time\n10.Shadows Of The Night\n11.Little Too Late\n12.Looking For A Stranger\n13.Love Is A Battlefield\n14.We Belong\n15.Ooh Ooh Song\n16.Invincible\n17.Sex As A Weapon\n18.Le Bel Age\n19.All Fired Up\n20.One Love\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54772e31aacfb13631707fc4427900e94d4631b1","amp;dn":"Pat+Benatar+-+Greatest+Hits+%282005%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54772e31aacfb13631707fc4427900e94d4631b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,119,46,49,170,207,177,54,49,112,127,196,66,121,0,233,77,70,49,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
