When they took the stage for the only performances that this band would ever play together, however, they come together seamlessly. Part of the credit must go to Ry Cooder, who directs the band without stealing the spotlight, and also Compay Segundo, a charismatic frontman who pulls everyone together through the sheer force of his personality.\n \nThe recording of Ã¢â‚¬Å“At Carnegie HallÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is immaculate, the performance breathtaking. It's just a sheer pleasure to listen to so many talented musicians make beautiful and enchanting music. Highly recommended.\n\n\nBuena Vista Social Club\n\nAt Carnegie Hall\n\nRecorded in 1998, released in 2008\n\n \n 2 CDs / 2008 / 320Kbps\n\n\nAt Carnegie Hall / Disc 1:\n\n1. Chan Chan \n\n2.
