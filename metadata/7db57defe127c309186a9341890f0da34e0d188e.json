He's also a record producer, record label head, and philanthropist set on making the world a better place for as many people as possible. With his winning combination of country, bluegrass, reggae, and Caribbean music, he appeals to country fans and jam band hippies, and could well cross over to lovers of world music and pop. He sold over 30,000 copies of the first two self-produced albums he made for his own Southern Ground label, and &quot;Chicken Fried,&quot; The Zac Brown Band's first single to get national distribution, went platinum with over a million downloads. His first nationally distributed album, The Foundation, sold 300,000 copies within weeks of its release in late 2008.\n\nBrown was born in 1978 in Atlanta, Georgia, and grew up in Dahlonega, a small town in the north Georgia mountains. He was the 11th child in a family of 12 kids.\n\n\nGenre................: Country Pop\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Lossless Audiochecker, Accurip Log, Cue\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\n01.Beautiful Drug\n02.Loving You Easy\n03.Remedy\n04.Homegrown\n05.Mango Tree (Feat.
