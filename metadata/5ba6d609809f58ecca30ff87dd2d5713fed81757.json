But here they are, revisiting some of their most beloved tunes as well as four new ones, on this mostly live, largely acoustic disc. Frey, Henley, Walsh, Schmit, and Felder tackle iconic Eagles standards like &quot;Hotel California,&quot; &quot;Tequila Sunrise,&quot; &quot;Take It Easy,&quot; &quot;Desperado,&quot; and &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot; and new tunes like &quot;Get Over It&quot; and &quot;Love Will Keep Us Alive&quot; with the smoothly\ncocky assurance that originally made them icons. --Scott Schinder\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Get over it                                          [03:31]\n02.Love will keep us alive                              [04:03]\n03.The girl form yesterday                              [03:24]\n04.Learn to be still                                    [04:29]\n05.Tequila sunrise                                      [03:28]\n06.Hotel california                                     [07:12]\n07.Wasted time                                          [05:20]\n08.Pretty maids all in A row                            [04:27]\n09.I can't tell you why                                 [05:11]\n10.New york minute                                      [06:38]\n11.The last resort                                      [07:25]\n12.Take it easy                                         [04:36]\n13.In the city                                          [04:08]\n14.Life in the fast lane                                [06:01]\n15.Desperado                                            [04:15]\n____\n\n74:08 min\n109,3 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ba6d609809f58ecca30ff87dd2d5713fed81757","amp;dn":"The_Eagles-Hell_Freezes_Over-%28Retail_Live%29-1994-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ba6d609809f58ecca30ff87dd2d5713fed81757","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,166,214,9,128,159,88,236,202,48,255,135,221,45,87,19,254,216,23,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
