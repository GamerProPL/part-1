New Office for Mac 2011 Service Pack 1 is applicable to all editions of the office productivity suites available for the Mac OS X platform.  \n\nThe downloaded update from the  Microsoft website will not work on applications that have been cracked (I tried). They has also released a second service packed, but I couldn't find that one un-cracked.\n\nThe first Service Pack of Office for Mac 2011 brings major changes in Outlook application. Also, do note that this SP1 won't sync MobileMe calendar while using the Sync Services. That's due to the recent changes in the MobileMe and we anticipate Apple to release a free version of MobileMe in the coming months.\n\nApart from that, there are several enhancements and fixes for the productivity suite. \n\nFeatures of the update for all Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 applications include:\n\n* Improved security: fixes vulnerabilities where an attacker can use to\n    overwrite the contents of the computer's memory with malicious code.\n\n* Improved Stability: fixes an issue that causes Office for Mac 2011 \n   applications to close unexpectedly when you open or use Office for \n   Mac 2011 applications.\n\n* Alt Text authoring enabled for objects, such as shapes, pictures, tables,\n    charts, SmartArt, and movies in Office 2011 applications.\n\n* Protect PowerPoint for Mac 2011 presentations using passwords\n\n* Install Solver add-in analysis tool in Excel for Mac 2011\n\n* Increases support for Sync Services, and adds calendar, notes, and\n   tasks syncing in Outlook for Mac 2011\n\n* Support for Microsoft Exchange-based Server-Side rules in Outlook\n   for Mac 2011\n\n* Brings back the resend feature for an email message to the same or new\n   recipients in Outlook for Mac 2011\n\n* Redirect an incoming email message to other recipients in Outlook for\n   Mac 2011\n\n* Create meeting invitations by including a list of recently used locations\n   in Outlook for Mac 2011\n\nThis update fixes critical issues and also helps to improve security.
