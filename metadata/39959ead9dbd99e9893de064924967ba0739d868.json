By the time of their acknowledgment by the national punk scene, they had reignited a &quot;pogo&quot; element to New Jersey punk rock by playing fast light-hearted songs, a model followed by various other local bands. In the early stages of their career, they played a hybrid of punk, funk, metal, and just about anything else they felt like including. They were known for their energetic live shows, albeit with an amateurish element on their recordings at that stage.\n\n=================================================================\nArtist    -  The Bouncing Souls        \nAlbum     -  various                                          \nGenre     -  punk                                             \nLabel     -  Epitaph Records, Chunksaah Records\nYear      -  1987 - present                                            \nTracks    -  n/a                                               \nPlaytime  -  n/a\nFile Type -  .mp3\nSize      -  685.11 MB\nkbps      -  VBR / 192 or higher / 256 avg\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy.
