Coach Norman Dale encounters several hurdles in his path: a feisty teacher determined to keep the best player from going out for the team, a town chock full of second-guessing fathers, and a group of undisciplined athletes. Story inspired by the Milan (Indiana) Indians' state title of 1954.\n\n\nTAGLINE:\n\n\nThey needed a second chance to finish first.\n\n\nSCREENSHOTS     &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/edf5d75390.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/edf5d75390.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAll stand-alone divx players compatible\n\n\nENJOY &amp; PLEASE SEED FOR AS LONG AS U CAN !!!! \n\n\nALSO IF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS DON'T HESITATE TO ASK.
