Set in what appears to be the 1960s, Snake Eater tells the story of a man who appears to be Solid Snake, but based on the time frame and information revealed in previous games, could be someone else altogether. Survival is a major theme throughout MGS3, as Snake must adapt to the harsh jungle environment, while at the same time battling enemy soldiers. Snake Eater promises a complex plot and vivid music score to rival a Hollywood blockbuster, along with and realistic graphics and high-definition sound that will take the series to new heights.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0669d80ea9ad96a3eb13c8926f44393cf39cb9ec","amp;dn":"Metal+Gear+Solid+3+-+Snake+Eater+%5BPS2%5D%5BFULLDVD%5D%5BMulti2%5D+pcto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0669d80ea9ad96a3eb13c8926f44393cf39cb9ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,105,216,14,169,173,150,163,235,19,200,146,111,68,57,60,243,156,185,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
