Written by a long-time expert on drawing and painting human anatomy, Classic Human Anatomy in Motion offers artists everything they need to realistically draw the human figure as it is affected by movement. Written in a friendly style, the book is illustrated with hundreds of life drawing studies (both quick poses and long studies), along with charts and diagrams showing the various anatomical and structural components. \r\n\r\nThis comprehensive manual features 5 distinct sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the human figure: bones and joint movement, muscle groups, surface form and soft tissue characteristics, structure, and movement. Each chapter builds an artistic understanding of how motion transforms the human figure and can create a sense of expressive vibrancy in one's art","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2abeaae5385be0275d02af1b06ca8eb51014ae06","amp;dn":"Classic+Human+Anatomy+in+Motion+%282015%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2abeaae5385be0275d02af1b06ca8eb51014ae06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,190,170,229,56,91,224,39,93,2,175,27,6,202,142,181,16,20,174,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
