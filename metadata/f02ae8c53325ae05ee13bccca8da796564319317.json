Narrated by Sam Neill.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Cast Adrift \r\nIsolated since the time of the dinosaurs, New Zealand's wildlife has been left to its own devices, with surprising consequences. Its ancient forests are still stalked by predators from the Jurassic era. It's also one of the most geologically active countries on earth. From Kiwis with their giant eggs, to forest-dwelling penguins and helicopter-riding sheep dogs, meet the astonishing creatures and resilient people who must rise to the challenges of their beautiful, dramatic and demanding home.\r\n\r\n2)  Wild Extremes \r\nThe most extreme and wild parts of New Zealand are in the South Island, which lie towards Antarctica, in the path of the tempestuous 'roaring forties'. This is home to some of the most rapidly rising mountains in the world, the Southern Alps. From hyper-intelligent parrots to sinister snails with teeth and magical constellations of glow-worms, this is the story of New Zealand's wildest places and its most resilient pioneers, all of whom must embrace radical solutions to survive.\r\n\r\n3)  New Arrivals \r\nNew Zealand was one of the last land masses to be found and settled by people. Lush and fertile, almost everything brought here flourishes, often with surprising consequences. Told through the experiences of its native species - in particular, a charismatic and peculiar giant, flightless parrot - this is the moving story of the changing fortunes of New Zealand's wildlife since humans first arrived.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d6/New-Zealand-Earths-Mythical-Islands-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f9/New-Zealand-Earths-Mythical-Islands-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/95/New-Zealand-Earths-Mythical-Islands-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e9/New-Zealand-Earths-Mythical-Islands-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a3/New-Zealand-Earths-Mythical-Islands-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/22/New-Zealand-Earths-Mythical-Islands-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f3/New-Zealand-Earths-Mythical-Islands-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0a/New-Zealand-Earths-Mythical-Islands-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/02/New-Zealand-Earths-Mythical-Islands-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6a/New-Zealand-Earths-Mythical-Islands-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1c/New-Zealand-Earths-Mythical-Islands-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b8/New-Zealand-Earths-Mythical-Islands-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/33/New-Zealand-Earths-Mythical-Islands-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f5/New-Zealand-Earths-Mythical-Islands-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d8/New-Zealand-Earths-Mythical-Islands-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ef/New-Zealand-Earths-Mythical-Islands-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video: Bitrate: CRF-21 (~2931 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins,\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.27 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07lslq4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f02ae8c53325ae05ee13bccca8da796564319317","amp;dn":"BBC+New+Zealand+Earths+Mythical+Islands+2of3+Wild+Extremes+720p+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f02ae8c53325ae05ee13bccca8da796564319317","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,42,232,197,51,37,174,5,238,19,188,204,168,218,121,101,100,49,147,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
