I can access virtually anything from anywhere, Anonymously, then stick the SD card back in my phone and go.&quot; \r\n\r\nOther books tell you to encrypt your hard drive and install anonymity software... that just looks suspicious. I don't know about you, but I want to keep my need for Anonymity a secret. \r\n-------- \r\nI will show you how to: \r\nâ€¢ Browse the Internet Anonymously \r\nâ€¢ Use someone elseâ€™s computer without them knowing \r\nâ€¢ Circumvent Windows without altering anything on the system \r\nâ€¢ Make an email account that actually is anonymous (youâ€™ve probably never heard of this) \r\nâ€¢ Use PGP Encryption the right way (I make this simple) \r\nâ€¢ Taunt Kim Jung-Un \r\n-------- \r\nI will show you why Bitcoin is NOT Anonymous and how that is about to change. \r\n\r\nI provide you future updates to keep you up-to-date with this quickly evolving game of Cat and Mouse \r\n\r\nThis manual is written: \r\nâ€¢ In 1-2-3 step format \r\nâ€¢ With concise, yet thorough, instructions \r\nâ€¢ For beginners using a PC \r\n\r\n***--This is based on the mantra &quot;Keep It Simple Stupid.&quot;--*** \r\n\r\nI wrote this so you could be anonymous TODAY. Why waste a week reading about online Anonymity to still end up having to figure out how to implement it yourself? \r\n\r\n!!! Donâ€™t buy anonymity software or subscribe to a proxy service !!! \r\n\r\nHere are a couple of important points regarding Online Anonymity: \r\nâ€¢ Disabling Cookies is USELESS - You are still traceable by your digital fingerprints. \r\nâ€¢ Using an IP Proxy Service is BAD - It routes all your activity through a central source that can track you. \r\nâ€¢ Logging into a computer is BAD - It leaves a record that you were there. \r\nâ€¢ Subscribing to an Anonymity Service is BAD - You are giving them your name, credit card info, etc. to buy anonymity... it isn't anonymous if you give them information. \r\nâ€¢ Creating an &quot;anonymous&quot; Yahoo, Gmail, etc. account is BAD - Just ask General Petraeus how well this works. \r\nâ€¢ JavaScript is BAD - this is a prime vehicle for transporting Malware into your system. \r\nâ€¢ Super-Cookies are BAD - They regenerate deleted cookies, they are stealth and hard to delete. \r\nâ€¢ Digital Fingerprints are REALLY BAD - Advertisers have begun using digital fingerprints to track user activity. They are created by gathering the data your system provides websites, such as, installed fonts, browser extensions and their micro-versions, operating system and its updates, time zone, etc., etc., etc... While individual bits of this information are not particularly dangerous, collectively, they are compiled to create a traceable and unique digital fingerprint. \r\nâ€¢ Bitcoin is NOT Anonymous â€“ Other books tell you that Bitcoins are Anonymous or that you can use â€œBitcoin Laundryâ€ services to cover your tracks. I will show why they are wrong and what technology is in the works to fix this. \r\n\r\nDonâ€™t Worry! We are going to work around all of these","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faab2a54dadef199f6ec0ace3e2bc018b27c2207","amp;dn":"How+to+be+Anonymous+Online+2016+%28ePub%2C+Mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faab2a54dadef199f6ec0ace3e2bc018b27c2207","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,171,42,84,218,222,241,153,246,236,10,206,62,43,192,24,178,124,34,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
