For his 48th birthday, Van Orton's brother, Conrad (Sean Penn) buys him a ticket to &quot;The Game.&quot; The game is a fictional attempt to destroy Van Orton's secure life of power and affluence. The adventure begins with Van Orton the multi-millionaire, and ends with Van Orton the pauper. &quot;The Game&quot; forces Van Orton to doubt and confuse fact with fiction, the real from the unreal. The viewer also faces the same dilemma constantly guessing whether he's watching a game or a real scenario.\n\n  Starring: Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, Deborah Kara Unger.\n\n  Directed by: David Fincher.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 2hr 8min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 336.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49bec0dee48a8b33713752e9ad104584f2c06162","amp;dn":"The+Game+%281997%29+%28Michael+Douglas%2C+Deborah+Kara+Unger%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49bec0dee48a8b33713752e9ad104584f2c06162","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,190,192,222,228,138,139,51,113,55,82,233,173,16,69,132,242,192,97,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
