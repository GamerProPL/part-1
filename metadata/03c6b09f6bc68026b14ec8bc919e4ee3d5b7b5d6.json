In their original incarnation, Hole was one of the noisiest, most abrasive alternative bands performing in the early '90s. By the time of their second album, 1994's Live Through This, the band had smoothed out many of their rougher edges, also adding more melodies and hooks to their songwriting. Through both versions of Hole, Love's combative, assaultive persona permeated the group's music and lyrics, giving the band a tense, unpredictable edge even at their quietest moments. Love formed Hole in Los Angeles in 1989, recruiting guitarist Eric Erlandson through a newspaper ad. Love had played with numerous bands before Hole, including early versions of both Babes in Toyland and Faith No More. Erlandson and Love eventually drafted bassist Jill Emery and drummer Caroline Rue into the band, recording their first album with producer Kim Gordon, the bassist for Sonic Youth. The violent and uncompromising Pretty on the Inside, Hole's debut record, was released on Caroline Records in 1991 to numerous positive reviews, especially in the British weekly music press.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Celebrity Skin\n02.Awful\n03.Hit So Hard\n04.Malibu\n05.Reasons To Be Beautiful\n06.Dying\n07.Use Once And Destroy\n08.Northern Star\n09.Boys On The Radio\n10.Heaven Tonight\n11.Playing Your Song\n12.Petals\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03c6b09f6bc68026b14ec8bc919e4ee3d5b7b5d6","amp;dn":"Hole+-+Celebrity+Skin+%281998%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03c6b09f6bc68026b14ec8bc919e4ee3d5b7b5d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,198,176,159,107,198,128,38,177,78,200,188,145,158,78,227,213,183,181,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
