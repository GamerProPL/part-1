This course provides an overview of the fundamentals, from performing common calculations to conducting Bayesian analysis with Excel. Author Curt Frye starts with the foundational concepts, including an introduction to the central limit theorem, and then shows how to visualize data, relationships, and future results with Excel's histograms, graphs, and charts. He also covers testing hypotheses, modeling different data distributions, and calculating the covariance and correlation between data sets. The course closes with a look at calculating Bayesian probabilities in Excel.\n\nThis course qualifies for 2.25 Category A professional development units (PDUs) through lynda.com, PMI Registered Education Provider #4101.\n\n\nTopics include:\n\n    Calculating mean and median values\n    Analyzing data using variance and standard deviation\n    Minimizing errors\n    Visualizing data with histograms, charts, and more\n    Testing hypotheses\n    Measuring covariance and correlation\n    Performing Bayesian analysis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:525fbf872090a3d2d5414623a56bd5f7fe5daaff","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Data-Analysis+Fundamentals+with+Excel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"525fbf872090a3d2d5414623a56bd5f7fe5daaff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,95,191,135,32,144,163,210,213,65,70,35,165,107,213,247,254,93,170,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
