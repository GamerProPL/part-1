Hope you guys enjoy and please help seed.\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\nChangelog for version 1.014: AKA Patch EN \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢First round of game balance updates, stay tuned for more goodies! \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Revised how STATS work! (yes, you read correctly) \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Revised ALL melee and ranged weapons and added new ones! \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Added STATUS EFFECTS (like drunk, poison etc.) \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Revised weapon boosts and added new ones (even to ranged weapons), some of which apply status effects \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Added rudimentary MOD SUPPORT (some game data is now loaded from xml files and can be overwritten in the new Mods folder, don't ask us how to do it, we don't know!) \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Added FULL translation support (existing translations can also be overwritten from Mods/Translations) Current translations are English, Spanish, Finnish, PARTIAL French (70%), PARTIAL Italian (80-90%) and FULL German. In the coming days we will be updating those PARTIAL languages with the full language sets as they come out! \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Drunken pirates will emit BUBBLES from their FACE! (seriously, what more could you ask for?!) \n\n\n--------------------------\n\n\nNote: Basically for all who don't know this is the patch that changes Pixel Piraxy to Enchanced Edition and in which older save games may not work since the game code has been changed significantly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:906bf699df7f6444459938d191317055ba4acfee","amp;dn":"Pixel+Piracy+%28Latest+With+1.014%29+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"906bf699df7f6444459938d191317055ba4acfee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,107,246,153,223,127,100,68,69,153,56,209,145,49,112,85,186,74,207,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
