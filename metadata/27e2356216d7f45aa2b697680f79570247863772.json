But with the local economy rising back up and occupancy reaching its maximum, SherriSoda Tower has decided to bring back the old Cook, Serve, Delicious restaurant, and has given you complete control to bring it back to its old five star status of world class dining.\n\nTo do that, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll start with a few thousand dollars and thirty foods to choose from to put on your menu, as well as a host of restaurant equipment and more. Nearly everything is unlocked from the start of the game for you to purchase; this is your restaurant, and you must figure out the best strategy to get that restaurant packed with satisfied customers. Can you prove your culinary skills?\n\nAnd if that werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t enough, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also have the opportunity to be cast in the Iron Cook television show, throw parties for offices in SherriSoda Tower, read virtual mail in your SherriSoda Tower Email account which ranges from game tips to crazy spam, from customers providing feedback to your restaurant to opportunities to being able to fund projects via Ã¢â‚¬Å“ClicknStartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and other big surprises!\n\nWith hours of content and tons of secrets and unlockables, Cook, Serve, Delicious will provide a big challenge for anyone whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ready to take their crumbling, rat infested eatery to a luxurious Platinum Star Restaurant. Good luck!\n\n\nGame Info:\n***********\nReady 2 Play\nCrack: Velocity/RAZZ\nRePacked by: Foxy Games\nReleased: November 2014\nSize: 110 Mb\nPlatform: PC / Windows\nGenre(s): Time Management / Cooking\n\nAbout Update:\n**************\nThe game now correctly rewards you with the prize money earned if you beat more than one extra event in a row without going to the main menu.\nA bug occurred with the dating scenario where not serving your date the proper food on your menu resulted in no customers for hours at a time.\nThe game would sometimes reset the corndog foods to not being purchased in the two star level restaurants.\nAddressed some minor bugs and grammar issues.\n\n* Here's all the improvements you'll see in the patch:\n\nNEW FEATURES\n*************\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Battle Kitchen Mode added! This new expansion is unlocked at the onset and is separate from the Campaign Mode. Some of the new modes include...\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Weekly Challenges (1 player)- Leaderboard time based challenges with a new challenge each week!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Strike Challenges (1-4 players)- Take on twelve brand new challenges on your own or Tag Team with 3 others locally!

Unlock them by completing Strike Challenges, participating in a Weekly Challenge or going as far as you can in Endurance mode.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Campaign Co-op- play with a friend simultaneously in the main Campaign! One person cooks, and the other expedites the orders. Works with your current save and is a fun way to play the game with others!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢All new Statistics Menu- Three pages of detailed data that uses your current save, from how many pounds of meat you've served to a breakdown of each food you've made.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Enchiladas have been completely retooled to be more user friendly and faster to prepare (no more wait times needed for frying tortillas).\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢You can now select specific recipes to practice on in Practice mode.\n\n\nNEW ADDITIONS/IMPROVEMENTS (ENGINE)\n***********************************\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Improved controller handling when plugging/unplugging a controller during a game.

Also improves performance across all machines.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Implemented new render modes. Originally an option for &quot;High Rendering&quot; allowed the game to render at 1080p once restarted. Now there are three options: Standard Render (displays the game at 720p), High Render (displays the game at 1080p, is the new default option), 2K and 4K renders (upscales the game for resolutions above 1080p).
