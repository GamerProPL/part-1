Along the way, Mr. Williams has received thirty-six Academy AwardÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® nominations and has been awarded five OscarsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, four British Film Academy Awards, sixteen Grammys and three Golden Globes. His score for Schindler&amp;#039;s List earned him both an OscarÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® and a Grammy. \n\nWith instantly recognizable tracks, Greatest Hits 1969-1999 is an amazing journey through some of the most unforgettable movie experiences of two generations. From the hauntingly terrifying opening notes from Jaws, to the triumphant &quot;Flying Theme&quot; from E.T., to the somber pride of Saving Private Ryan, John Williams&amp;#039; music is forever linked to our images of these films. \n\nThis beautifully packaged two-CD career retrospective is the definitive collection of Williams&amp;#039; work includes music from some of the most successful and best loved movies of all time. It features performances by Yo-Yo Ma on Seven Years in Tibet (SK 60271) and Itzhak Perlman on Schindler&amp;#039;s List. Also included are Williams&amp;#039; two Olympic themes &quot;Olympic Theme and Fanfare&quot; from the 1984 Los Angeles games and &quot;Summon the Heroes&quot; (SK 62592) from the 1996 Centennial Games in Atlanta. \n\nTRACKLIST:\n\nDisc 1\n1 Star Wars - Main Title 5:44 \n2 E.T. - Flying Theme 3:42 \n3 Superman - Main Title 4:25 \n4 Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom - Parade of the Children 4:53 \n5 Sugarland Express - Theme 3:35 \n6 Jaws - Theme 2:31 \n7 Olympic Fanfare and Theme 4:28 \n8 Return of the Jedi - Luke and Leia 5:02 \n9 The Reivers - Main Title 5:13 \n10 The Empire Strikes Back - The Imperial March 3:04 \n11 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade - For Motorcycle and Orchestra 2:48 \n12 Empire of the Sun - Cadillac of the Skies 4:58\n13 Raiders of the Lost Ark - The Raider&amp;#039;s March 5:11\n14 Close Encounters of the Third Kind - Suite 9:46 \n\n\nDisc 2 \n1 Saving Private Ryan - Hymn to the Fallen 6:10 \n2 Jurassic Park - Theme 5:29 \n3 Schindler&amp;#039;s List - Theme 3:32 \n4 Hook - Flight to Neverland 4:41 \n5 Seven Years in Tibet - Seven Years in Tibet 7:09 \n6 JFK - Prologue 4:00 \n7 Stepmom - The Days Between 6:27 \n8 1941 - March 4:14\n9 Home Alone - Somewhere in My Memory 4:54 \n10 Summon the Heroes 6:14 \n11 Rosewood - Look Down, Lord 4:12\n12 Far and Away - Theme 5:34 \n13 Born on the Fouth of July - Theme 6:20 \n14 Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace - Duel of the Fates 4:14 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cea64bb380e0231ad7190844eb7b0c03725dcd53","amp;dn":"John+Williams+-+Greatest+Hits+%281969+-+1999%29+%5B2CD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cea64bb380e0231ad7190844eb7b0c03725dcd53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,166,75,179,128,224,35,26,215,25,8,68,235,123,12,3,114,93,205,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
