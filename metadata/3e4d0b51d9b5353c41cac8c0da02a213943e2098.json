The expansion adds four more classes you can play with, effectively doubling the number of heroes. Here's the link: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2750283\n\nInstallation: \n1. Mount the .cue image in Daemon Tools\n2. Unzip &amp; run the patch\n3. Unzip the expansion and place only the assets.zip file into your puzzle quest/patches directory and you're good to go.\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e4d0b51d9b5353c41cac8c0da02a213943e2098","amp;dn":"Puzzle+Quest+Challenge+Of+The+Warlords+%2B+update+1.02+%2B+expansion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e4d0b51d9b5353c41cac8c0da02a213943e2098","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,77,11,81,217,181,53,60,65,202,200,192,218,2,162,19,148,62,32,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
