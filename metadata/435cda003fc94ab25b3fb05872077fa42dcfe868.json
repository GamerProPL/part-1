The tour was dividLed into two legs, with performances commencing on 27 May and concluding on 28 June 1972. It included two warm-up shows in Europe.\r\nThis was the first tour in which Led Zeppelin used songs from their upcoming album Houses of the Holy (&quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot;, &quot;Dancing Days&quot;, and &quot;The Ocean&quot;). This was also the last concert tour on which Led Zeppelin included an acoustic section until it was revived in 1975 for their Earls Court performances. John Bonham sang co-lead vocals with Robert Plant during the song Bron-Y-Aur Stomp. The decision to drop the acoustic set was perhaps made because their live concerts were regularly extending into three hour long marathons (and sometimes up to four and a half hours), which were becoming taxing on all four band members.\r\n\r\nTracklist Disk 1 Lossless\r\n\r\n01 - Drone.\r\n02 - Immigrant Song.\r\n03 - Heartbreaker.\r\n04 - Black Dog.\r\n05 - Since Ive Been Loving You.\r\n06 - Stairway To Heaven.\r\n07 - Going To California.\r\n08 - Thats The Way.\r\n09 - Tangerine.\r\n10 - Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp.\r\n\r\nDisk 2 Lossless\r\n\r\nD2T1 - Dazed and Confused.\r\nD2T2 - What Is and What Should Never Be\r\nD2T3 - Moby Dick.\r\nD2T4 - Whole Lotta Love.\r\nD2T5 - Rock and Roll.\r\n\r\n\r\nBootlegging is often incorrectly referred to as piracy but there are important differences between the two terms.
