Dunn had previously worked with singer Mike Patton in the bands Mr. Bungle and FantÃƒÂ´mas.[1] The album was recorded over six days in Easy Eye Sound Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, and produced by Collin Dupuis and the band. Dupuis had previously worked with the band The Black Keys, whose singer Dan Auerbach owns Easy Eye Sound.[2] Cartoonist Ivan Brunetti has provided the album's cover artwork.[3]\n\nDrummer John Stanier has described the band as &quot;the absolute simplest, most professional ensemble I have ever been involved with, by far&quot;.[4] The band planned to meet and rehearse for a week before recording the album, but upon getting together again, Patton experienced a death in the family which resulted in him leaving for several days. The band eventually reconvened to rehearse for what Stanier recalls as &quot;a day and a half&quot;.[4] Denison felt positively about the process of recording in Nashville, finding that the cheaper studio costs meant he could allow his compositions to &quot;gestate&quot; for longer during his writing process.[4]\n\nThe album comprises fifteen tracks,[3] which Spin magazine's Christopher R. Weingarten has described as featuring a mix of genres, including &quot;groany, smoky, Morricone-jazz&quot; and &quot;the types of epic, majestic choruses that Patton diehards might remember from the final Faith No More LP, Album of the Year&quot;.[1]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41969eda831f10641ab09df547a1b9b935befbc6","amp;dn":"Tomahawk+-+Oddfellows+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41969eda831f10641ab09df547a1b9b935befbc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,150,158,218,131,31,16,100,26,176,157,245,71,161,185,185,53,190,251,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
