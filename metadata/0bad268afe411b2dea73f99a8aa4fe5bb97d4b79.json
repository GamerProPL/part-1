The vast majority were elite members of various societies and artificial cranial deformation was performed on them as infants in order to achieve a specific look so as to differentiate them from the general public. Nowhere was this more commonplace than in Peru and Bolivia, and this book sets out to figure out where these societies lived, when, and how they may have been related. The most mysterious aspect is that some of the ancient people of Peru and Bolivia may have in fact been born with elongated skulls. Should this turn out through medical examination to be true, the history of humanity many have to be re-written","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bad268afe411b2dea73f99a8aa4fe5bb97d4b79","amp;dn":"Elongated+Skulls+of+Peru+and+Bolivia%3A+The+Path+of+Viracocha","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bad268afe411b2dea73f99a8aa4fe5bb97d4b79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,173,38,138,254,65,27,45,234,115,249,154,138,164,254,91,185,125,75,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
