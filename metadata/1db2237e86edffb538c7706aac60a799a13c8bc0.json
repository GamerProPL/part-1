If you're trying to establish a cloud presence, AWS offers a cost-effective, scalable infrastructure. Jeremy covers what AWS is, how it works, and how you (and your organization) can get started using it.\n\nThis series is full of cool technology, but the biggest Ã¢â‚¬Å“way-coolÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ factor is the complete shift in the way we think about and handle Information Technology! With AWS, you no longer have to build your own world-wide IT enterprise solution to deliver amazing cloud-based services.\n\nJeremy walks you through how to sign up for an AWS account, create and use instances, Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Simple Storage Service (S3), and more. You'll also see a real-life case study on a company called CBT Nuggets that migrated its services to AWS.\n\nFind out how easy it is to use AWS, and how to make the powerful features of AWS work for you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1db2237e86edffb538c7706aac60a799a13c8bc0","amp;dn":"CBT+Nuggets+-+Amazon+Web+Services+-+AWS+Foundations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1db2237e86edffb538c7706aac60a799a13c8bc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,178,35,126,134,237,255,181,56,199,112,106,172,96,167,153,161,60,139,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
