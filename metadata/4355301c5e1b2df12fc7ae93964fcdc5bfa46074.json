He joins Castro's rebels. By 1964, he is in Havana. He meets the wealthy Pepe, an early lover; a love-hate relationship lasts for years. Openly gay behavior is a way to spite the government. His writing and homosexuality get him into trouble: he spends two years in prison, writing letters for other inmates and smuggling out a novel. He befriends Lazaro Gomes Garriles, with whom he lives stateless and in poverty in Manhattan after leaving Cuba in the Mariel boat-lift. When asked why he writes, he replies cheerfully, &quot;Revenge.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4355301c5e1b2df12fc7ae93964fcdc5bfa46074","amp;dn":"Before+Night+Falls+%282000%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4355301c5e1b2df12fc7ae93964fcdc5bfa46074","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,85,48,28,94,27,45,241,47,199,174,147,150,79,205,197,191,164,96,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
