Anybody who's interested to know, I will be trying to get my hands on Earth Rocker when it drops in 2013, and I'll do us all a courtesy by having it up for you all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82f67dbc81c5ccb46662f69cd33747a1927d7b11","amp;dn":"Clutch+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82f67dbc81c5ccb46662f69cd33747a1927d7b11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,246,125,188,129,197,204,180,102,98,246,156,211,55,71,161,146,125,123,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
