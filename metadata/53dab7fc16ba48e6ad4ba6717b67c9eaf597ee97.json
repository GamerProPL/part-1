I won`t really care. But if you like it, don`t forget to rate the download.\nOf course scanned blah blah blah blah and so on. As a bonus you get the cover of the album.\n\n\n\nList of tracks:\n\n1 Balls &amp; My Word 3:45\n2 Scarface 5:04\n3 My Mind Playin&amp;#039; Tricks on Me 5:06\n4 Straight Gangstaism 4:26\n5 Six Feet Deep 5:24\n6 World Is a Geto 4:23\n7 Geto Boys &amp; Girls 5:58\n8 Let a Ho Be a Ho 3:41\n9 It Ain&amp;#039;t 4:31\n10 Mind of a Lunatic 5:23\n11 Chuckie 3:45\n12 Trigga Happy Nigga 4:46\n13 Crooked Officer 4:08\n14 Gangsta (Put Me Down) 4:17\n15 Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta 5:07\n16 Geto Fantasy 4:29\n17 The Answer to Baby (Mary II) (*) 4:16\n\n\nReview:\n\nThis is a second and more inclusive package of the Geto Boys&amp;#039; best moments. \nThe first, Uncut Dope, covered the group through 1991&amp;#039;s We Can&amp;#039;t Be Stopped; this opens it up to include tracks \nfrom 1993&amp;#039;s Till Death Do Us Part, 1996&amp;#039;s Resurrection, and 1998&amp;#039;s Da Good da Bad &amp; da Ugly. Those three albums were more patchy than \nthe ones that came before them -- with the exception of Making Trouble -- and none of the highlights from them are of the caliber \nof earlier tracks like &quot;Mind of a Lunatic,&quot; &quot;My Mind Playing Tricks on Me,&quot; and &quot;Trigga Happy Nigga.&quot; So, going strictly by \npound-for-pound quality, Uncut Dope is the better of the two, but it&amp;#039;s not as if later \ntracks like &quot;Six Feet Deep,&quot; &quot;The World Is a Geto,&quot; and &quot;Gangsta (Put Me Down)&quot; are entirely undeserving of \nanthology status. Furthermore, this disc has five more tracks and has better sound quality -- naturally so since it was released ten years after \nUncut Dope. Choosing where to go first with this group is a tough call: The Geto Boys is the group&amp;#039;s best album, but going with that leaves one \nwithout some of the group&amp;#039;s best material. And neither Uncut Dope nor Greatest Hits are clear-cut first stops. Regardless of the choice, some of \nthe most brutally descriptive and alternately funny Southern hip-hop is in well-stocked supply. ~ Andy Kellman, All Music Guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53dab7fc16ba48e6ad4ba6717b67c9eaf597ee97","amp;dn":"Geto+Boys+-+Greatest+Hits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53dab7fc16ba48e6ad4ba6717b67c9eaf597ee97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,218,183,252,22,186,72,230,173,75,166,113,123,103,201,234,245,151,238,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
