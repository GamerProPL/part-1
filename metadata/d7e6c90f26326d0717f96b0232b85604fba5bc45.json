By the late 1990s he had become a dance/pop sensation, with a more mature sound that was still rooted in dance with a rock edge.\n\n\n-Life Thru A Lens (1997)\n\n-I've Been Expecting You (1998)\n\n-Sing When You're Winning (2000)\n\n-Swing When You're Winning (2001)\n\n-Escapology (2002)\n\n-Live At Knebworth (2003)\n\n-Greatest Hits (2004)\n\n-Intensive Care (2005)\n\n-Rudebox (2006)\n\n-Reality Killed The Video Star (2009)\n\n-In And Out Of Consciousness (2010) (3-disc edition)\n\nI have also included a copy of the new Take That album &quot;Progress&quot; which Robbie heavily features on.\n\nPlease feel free to leave comments.\n\nPlease seed for others to enjoy. Many thanks. :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7e6c90f26326d0717f96b0232b85604fba5bc45","amp;dn":"Robbie+Williams+-+Discography+%281997-2011%29+320kbps+%5Bkarl2802%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7e6c90f26326d0717f96b0232b85604fba5bc45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,230,201,15,38,50,109,7,23,249,107,2,50,184,86,4,251,165,188,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
