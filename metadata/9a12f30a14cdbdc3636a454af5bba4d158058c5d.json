The half-hour \nlong show premiered on Sunday, April 27, 2014, and is hosted by comedian John Oliver. Last Week Tonight shares \nsome similarities with Comedy Central's The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, where Oliver was previously featured as a \ncorrespondent and fill-in host, exploring a satirical look at news, politics and current events on a weekly basis.\n\nOliver's contract with HBO lasts two years with an option for more. Oliver says he has full creative freedom, \nincluding free rein to criticize corporations. That freedom may be facilitated in part by HBO's ad-free \nsubscription model. Oliver and HBO programming president Michael Lombardo have discussed extending the show from \nhalf an hour to a full hour and airing more than once a week after Oliver &quot;gets his feet under him.&quot;\n\n\n\n        We pillage, we plunder, we rifle, and, loot\n                It's a pirate's life for me...\n                   Drink up, me hearties\n\t\t\t\n                       _____|____\n                      | Ph1l0s0phy|\n\t\t      |     1s    |\n\t\t      |\t   D34d   |\n                      |.----||----.\n                        .---''---,\n                         ;..__..'    _...\n                       ,'/  ;|/..--''    \n                     ,'_/.-/':            :\n                _..-'''/  /  |         _|/|\n                     /-./_ ;       ,;'   \n               ,    / :  `:       //    `:`.\n             ,'    /-._;   | :    : ::    ,.   .\n           ,'     ::   /`-._| |    | || ' :  `.`.)\n        _,'       |;._:: |  | |    | `|   :    `'\n      ,'   `.     /   |`-:_ ; |    |  |  : \n      `--.   )   /|-._:    :          |    \n         /  /   :_|   ;`-._;   __..--';    : :\n        /  (    ;|;-./_  _/.-:'o |   /     ' |\n       /  , ._/_/_./--''/_|:|___|_,'        |\n      :  /   `'-'--'----'---------'          |\n      | :     O ._O   O_.
