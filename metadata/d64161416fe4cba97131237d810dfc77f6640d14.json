The series follows the misadventures of alcoholic scientist Rick and his easily influenced grandson Morty, who split their time  between domestic family life and inter-dimensional travel. Roiland voices the series' titular characters, while the series also stars the voice talent of Chris Parnell, Spencer Grammer, and Sarah Chalke. The series has its origins in a crude animated short film created by Roiland for film festival Channel 101.\r\n\r\nRick is an eccentric, elderly, alcoholic scientist who has recently moved in with his daughter's family. He spends most of his time taking his young grandson Morty and later other family members on dangerous, outlandish adventures throughout the cosmos and alternate universes. Compounded with Morty's already unstable family life, these events cause Morty much distress at home and school.\r\n\r\nEach episode ends with a post-credits scene that completes each episode.\r\n\r\nSeason 2\r\n\r\n1080p H264 with all commentary tracks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d64161416fe4cba97131237d810dfc77f6640d14","amp;dn":"Rick.and.Morty.Season.2.1080p.BluRay.x264.with.commentary.tracks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d64161416fe4cba97131237d810dfc77f6640d14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,65,97,65,111,228,203,169,113,49,35,125,129,13,252,119,246,100,13,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
