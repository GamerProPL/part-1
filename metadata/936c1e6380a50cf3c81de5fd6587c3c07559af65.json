Enter Node.js and Express.js, two technologies that extend the capabilities of JavaScript. The Node platform allows you to develop server-side applications with JavaScript that you can then easily publish as websites with the Express framework. In this course, Ray Villalobos walks through the entire process of creating a website on a server with Node.js and Express.js. After going over the installation process, Ray shows how to build a basic application, control the state of an application with routing, and use templates and partials. Then he demonstrates how to quickly structure a site with Express Generator, work with models and views, and publish the final website using Heroku.\n\nNote: This course is intended for intermediate front-end web developers who are familiar with creating web projects and understand JavaScript basics.\nTopics include:\n\n    Installing Node.js and Express.js\n    Exploring the Node Package Manager\n    Creating and modularizing routes\n    Using templates\n    Adding partials\n    Using the Express Generator\n    Preparing your site structure\n    Adding static content\n    Importing your data\n    Passing custom data through routes\n    Publishing your application","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:936c1e6380a50cf3c81de5fd6587c3c07559af65","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Building+a+Website+with+Node.js+and+Express.js+with+Ray+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"936c1e6380a50cf3c81de5fd6587c3c07559af65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,108,30,99,128,165,12,243,200,29,229,253,101,135,195,192,117,89,175,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
