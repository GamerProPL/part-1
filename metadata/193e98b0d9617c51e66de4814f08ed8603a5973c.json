Yet, despite this preeminence in the collective mind, Egypt has suffered considerable destruction over the centuries. Even before the burning of the Great Library at Alexandria, the land of the pharaohs was pillaged by its own people. With the arrival of foreign rulers, both Arabic and European, the destruction and thievery continued along with suppression of ancient knowledge as some rulers sought to cleanse Egypt of its â€œpaganâ€ past. \r\n\r\nExploring the many cycles of destruction and suppression in Egypt as well as moments of salvation, such as the first registered excavations by Auguste Mariette, Robert Bauval and Ahmed Osman investigate the many conquerors of Egypt through the millennia as well as what has happened to famous artifacts such as the Rosetta Stone. They show how Napoleon, through his invasion, wanted to revive ancient Egyptian wisdom and art because of its many connections to Freemasonry. They reveal how the degradation of monuments, theft of relics, and censorship of ancient teachings continue to this day. Exposing recent cover-ups during the tenure of Antiquities Minister Zahi Hawass, they explain how new discoveries at Giza were closed to further research. \r\n\r\nClearing cultural and historical distortions, the authors reveal the long-hidden and persecuted voice of ancient Egypt and call for the return of Egypt to its rightful place as â€œthe Mother of Nationsâ€ and â€œthe Mirror of Heaven.â€","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:193e98b0d9617c51e66de4814f08ed8603a5973c","amp;dn":"Breaking+the+Mirror+of+Heaven%3A+The+Conspiracy+to+Suppress+...","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"193e98b0d9617c51e66de4814f08ed8603a5973c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,62,152,176,217,97,124,81,230,109,228,129,79,8,237,134,3,165,151,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
