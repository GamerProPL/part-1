If this was a torrent found all over the place the CD would have been tossed in the bin but I didn't see this collection pirated so thought it was worth saving. If you can spot them without using technical analysis then you win a new car.\n\n\n\nOther than that if the first song does not make you wanna groove and drive hump the air then your have no soul.\n\n- Big Papi\n\n\n\n\nBy mistermaxxx08\n\nNew Jack Swing was the last feel good era for me in R&amp;B Music. the hybrid and the feel good nature and energy of the music spoke for itself. before the Hybrid of R&amp;B and Hip-hop or Neo Soul which to me has slowed R&amp;B down almost to driving a pinto on a flat tire. New Jack swing had good songs and a tempo that kept you moving. so many talented acts emerged from this era. this is good party music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57944018100a28004bfa6844dc16c3a9e16bd5d0","amp;dn":"New+Jack+Swing+Gold+2-CD+Set+320cbr+Late+80%27s+and+90%27s+R%26amp%3BB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57944018100a28004bfa6844dc16c3a9e16bd5d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,148,64,24,16,10,40,0,75,250,104,68,220,22,195,169,225,107,213,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
