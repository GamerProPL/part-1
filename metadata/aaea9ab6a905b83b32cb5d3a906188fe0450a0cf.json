But if his approach to his instrument was constant, his approach to jazz was dazzlingly protean. To examine his career is to examine the history of jazz from the mid-'40s to the early '90s, since he was in the thick of almost every important innovation and stylistic development in the music during that period, and he often led the way in those changes, both with his own performances and recordings and by choosing sidemen and collaborators who forged new directions. It can even be argued that jazz stopped evolving when Davis wasn't there to push it forward.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tJazz\t\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nDisc One\n\n01.Pharaoh's Dance 20:06\n02.Bitches Brew 27:01\n03.Spanish Key 17:35\n04.John McLaughlin 4:23\n\nDisc Two\n\n01.Miles Runs The Voodoo Down 14:04\n02.Sanctuary 11:00\n03.Spanish Key (Alternate Take) 10:23\n04.John McLaughlin (Alternate Take) 6:41\n05.Miles Runs The Voodoo Down (Single Edit) 2:51\n06.Spanish Key (Single Edit) 2:51\n07.Great Expectations (Single Edit) 2:43\n08.Little Blue Frog (Single Edit) 2:36\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaea9ab6a905b83b32cb5d3a906188fe0450a0cf","amp;dn":"Miles+Davis+-+Bitches+Brew+Legacy+Edition+%282010%29+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaea9ab6a905b83b32cb5d3a906188fe0450a0cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,234,154,182,169,5,184,59,50,203,93,58,144,97,136,254,4,80,160,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
