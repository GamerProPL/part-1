After the song became a viral hit, Faker released his debut EP, Thinking in Textures, on the Opulent label in 2012. A year later he partnered with fellow Aussie Flume on the Lockjaw EP released on Future Classic, while 2014 saw the release of the slow and serene Built on Glass, his debut album for Downtown Records. \n\n\nGenre................: Electronic\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Audiochecker\n\n\nLockjaw EP w/Flume (2014)\n\n01.Drop The Game\n02.What About Us\n03.This Song Is Not About A Girl\n\n\n\nThinking In Textures EP (2012)\n\n01.I'm Into You\n02.Terms And Conditions\n03.No Diggity\n04.Love And Feeling\n05.Cigarettes And Chocolate\n06.Solo Sunrise\n07.Everything I Wanted\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acc950e8dcd94472e292b9c50aa9d9717d28af17","amp;dn":"Chet+Faker+-+Lockjaw+EP+%26amp%3B+Thinking+In+Textures+EP+%7BFLAC%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acc950e8dcd94472e292b9c50aa9d9717d28af17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,201,80,232,220,217,68,114,226,146,185,197,10,169,217,113,125,40,175,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
