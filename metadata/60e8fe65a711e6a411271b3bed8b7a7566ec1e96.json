What are we made of? What was there before the beginning? Are we really alone? Is there a creator? These questions have been pondered by the most exquisite minds of the human race. Now, science has evolved to the point where hard facts and evidence may be able to provide us with answers instead of philosophical theories. Through the Wormhole will bring together the brightest minds and best ideas from the very edges of science - Astrophysics, Astrobiology, Quantum Mechanics, String Theory, and more - to reveal the extraordinary truth of our Universe.\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisodes:\n\n\n______________________________\n# | Title | Original air date |\n__|_______|___________________|\n\n\n  |                     |              |\n1 | Is There a Creator? | June 9, 2010 |\n\nIs the universe just a coincidence or was it created by a god who looks after us?\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n  |                           |               |   \n2 | The Riddle of Black Holes | June 16, 2010 |\n\nNothing in the universe is more powerful than black holes.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n  |                          |               |   \n3 | Is Time Travel Possible? | June 23, 2010 |\n\nTo travel through time you have to break the speed of light.
