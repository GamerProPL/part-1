Tested and trusted, A WriterÃ¢Â€â„¢s Reference is an essential tool for students who are strengthening habits and skills that will support them throughout college.\r\n\r\nIn an April 2014 survey of first-year writers, 75 percent reported that using a Hacker handbook made them a more confident academic writer. WhatÃ¢Â€â„¢s more, A WriterÃ¢Â€â„¢s Reference has been a powerful tool for change across college campusesâ€”helping to create a culture of writing at many schools by supporting a common language for talking about academic writing. In that way, A WriterÃ¢Â€â„¢s Reference is uniquely positioned to help transform attitudes about the value of writing instruction and the role that writing plays in academic work and in higher learning.\r\n\r\nWith this eighth edition of the handbook, author Nancy Sommers invites you to be part of a community of those who teach and assign writing; who believe that critical reading, analytical writing, responsible research, and clarity are at the center of effective writing across the academy; and who use the nationÃ¢Â€â„¢s best-selling and most responsive handbook to support the development of the college writer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2fd93f9691add51c2d4fbdc40dbe3308e48ee5c","amp;dn":"A+Writer%27s+Reference+%288th+Edition+2015%29+by+Diana+Hacker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2fd93f9691add51c2d4fbdc40dbe3308e48ee5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,253,147,249,105,26,221,81,194,212,251,220,64,219,227,48,142,72,238,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
