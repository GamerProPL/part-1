The problem is, most of us aren't exactly sure what that desire is and how we can go about fulfilling it faithfully.\n\nIn Every Man's Marriage, you can discover the common misconceptions about what it means to exercise biblical authority and understand the role of submission in the marriage relationship. This groundbreaking book can help men grasp and apply essential but often overlooked principles for marital leadership.\n\nThrough candid reflections on their own struggles to achieve biblical unity in their own marriages, along with many years of combined experience in marital counseling, Arterburn and Stoeker apply solid, time-tested biblical wisdom to the everyday potential distortions that can lead to strife in a marriage.\n\nThe second book in the &quot;Every Man&quot; series, this is the perfect follow-up to the best-selling Every Man's Battle. Every Man's Marriage is a terrific resource for establishing mutual respect and sacrifice in your marriage based on Christ's example of loving His bride, the church.\n\nIncludes a comprehensive workbook for individual or group study.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:763476fce1587b420e2b49fa2ebd3c8a89000e77","amp;dn":"The+Gentleman%27s+Guide+to+Life+-+An+Every+Man%27s+Guide+to+Living+L","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"763476fce1587b420e2b49fa2ebd3c8a89000e77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,52,118,252,225,88,123,66,14,43,73,250,46,189,60,138,137,0,14,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
