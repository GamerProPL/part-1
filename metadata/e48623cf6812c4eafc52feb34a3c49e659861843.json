If you suffer from anxiety but have found little relief from modern western treatments, or if you are looking for complimentary treatment, the ancient practice of qigongÃ¢â‚¬â€which can be understood as the cultivation of internal energyÃ¢â‚¬â€may offer you relief.\n\nQigong is rooted in Chinese philosophy and medicine, and it utilizes breathing, movement, and awareness exercises to promote healing and aid in meditation. In The Qigong Workbook for Anxiety, world-renowned and respected qigong master Kam Chuen Lam presents the first workbook for overcoming anxiety problems utilizing traditional Chinese energy-focusing exercises. By following these simple and accessible step-by-step exercises, readers will learn to transform feelings of anxiety into resilience and inner strength. The workbook also contains helpful illustrations to help you carry out these exercises.\nIn the book, Lam will help you think about anxiety, and yourself, in a different wayÃ¢â‚¬â€as a whole. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also learn to stop resisting moments of anxiety and other strong emotions, but rather to embrace them within the larger flow of your bodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s energy field. By doing this, you will ultimately strengthen and cultivate the natural energy you possess.\n\nAuthor Kam Chuen Lam has been a traditional Chinese healer for over forty years, and is an internationally respected authority on the Chinese health systems of Chi Kung and Tai Chi.
