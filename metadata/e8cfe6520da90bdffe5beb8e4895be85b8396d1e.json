Artist Veronika Gronnegaard is dying of cancer and her estate is to be divided between her four adult children. Eldest daughter Gro worked with her mother, Frederik had cut off contact with her and Emil only got in touch when he needed money, while Signe was given up for adoption when she was born and had no idea she was VeronikaÃ‚â€˜s daughter until recently.
