Called Economic Boom, update 0.25 further expands on the career mode with a new Administrative building. Because, as we all know, the most exciting part of life at NASA is the paperwork.\n\nThe admin facility lets players select Strategies. &quot;The Strategy system is a new gameplay mechanic,&quot; explains SQUAD's patch post, &quot;where each strategy, once accepted, applies effects over several game aspects, specifically Kerbal Space Program s three in-game currencies.&quot; Examples include &quot;Aggressive Negotiations,&quot; which can give players a discount on parts at a cost to reputation.\n\nAs well as a new building, all facilities are now destructible. &quot;Buildings can be decimated by poorly-steered rocketships and in the game s Career Mode, require costly repairs for players trying to manage their space agency.&quot;\n\nSpaceplanes have also received some love, thanks to the integration of the SpacePlane+ mod.\n\nHead over to the official FAQ for more details of the patch, which is now live in-game.\n\nHOW TO INSTALL\n1. Mount or burn image\n3. Install\n4.
