The proprietors of Gas Monkey Garage in Dallas buy and restore forgotten and fading away American cars, everything from 1931 Model A's to '73 Trans Ams, before selling them at auction. As &quot;Fast N' Loud&quot; documents, Rawlings is the mastermind, the deal-maker with an eye for the relics worth bringing back to life, and to find them the guys scour barns, swap meets and overgrown fields across Texas and surrounding states. The restorations are primarily managed by Kaufmann, a fabricator and self-taught mechanic whose sharp skills and design savvy first endeared him to Rawlings and kick-started their partnership.\n\n1x01 Model A Madness\n1x02 Awesome Aussies and Olds\n1x03 Monkey Business Dragster\n1x04 Double Trouble Galaxie\n1x05 Low Riding Lincoln\n1x06 Frankensteined Ford\n1x07 Amazing Impala\n1x08 Ramshackle Rambler\n1x09 '48 Chevy Fleetmaster\n1x10 One of a Kind Woodill\n1x11 Fast &amp; Furious Fairmont\n1x12 Holy Grail Hot Rod\n1x13 Apache &amp; Road to Chopper Live Part 1\n1x14 Apache &amp; Road to Chopper Live Part 2\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/fast-n-loud/episodes-season-1/376152&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/fast-n-loud/episodes-season-1/376152&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVideo......: x264\nDimensions.: 720 x 404\nAudio......: Stereo AAC\nBitrate....: Variable\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c67fec7275ff885f03a6602e4f0832263705d05b","amp;dn":"Fast.N.Loud.Season.1.Complete.HDTV.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c67fec7275ff885f03a6602e4f0832263705d05b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,127,236,114,117,255,136,95,3,166,96,46,79,8,50,38,55,5,208,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
