Features all of Suede's biggest hits showcasing the group's early material with outstanding new production. This is the only Suede hits compilation that has been endorsed by the band. During the band's early years, they effectively instigated a new focus on British guitar music which had been largely eclipsed by Grunge before their emergence. Their inexorable rise saw them become one of the biggest groups in the country, a success which was replicated in many countries around the world. In 1999, after five studio albums, the group split.

The shows were hailed as a career high. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:564d6cea5ca9c46c60c2ffa4c2ddcab59dc489cf","amp;dn":"Suede+-+The+Best+Of+%5B2cd-mp3-256-2010%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"564d6cea5ca9c46c60c2ffa4c2ddcab59dc489cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,77,108,234,92,169,196,108,96,194,255,164,194,221,202,181,157,196,137,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
