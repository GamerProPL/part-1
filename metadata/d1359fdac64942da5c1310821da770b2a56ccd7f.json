In his latest book, he envisions an eventÃ¢â‚¬â€the &quot;singularity&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€in which technological change becomes so rapid and so profound that our bodies and brains will merge with our machines.\nThe Singularity Is Near portrays what life will be like after this eventÃ¢â‚¬â€ a human- machine civilization where our experiences shift from real reality to virtual reality and where our intelligence becomes nonbiological and trillions of times more powerful. In practical terms, this means that human aging and pollution will be reversed; world hunger will be solved; our bodies and environment transformed by nanotechnology to overcome the limitations of biology, including death; and virtually any physical product can be created from information alone. The Singularity Is Near also considers the social and philosophical ramifications of these changes, and is certain to be one of the most widely discussed and provocative books of 2005.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1359fdac64942da5c1310821da770b2a56ccd7f","amp;dn":"The+Singularity+Is+Near%3A+When+Humans+Transcend+Biology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1359fdac64942da5c1310821da770b2a56ccd7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,53,159,218,198,73,66,218,92,19,16,130,29,167,112,178,165,108,205,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
