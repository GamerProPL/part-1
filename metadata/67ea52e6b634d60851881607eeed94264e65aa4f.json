Now, von Holzen broadens his scope to include all the fabled Spice Islands of Indonesia.\nThe Food of Indonesia shares seventy-nine tantalizing recipes for the most popular dishesÃ¢â‚¬â€along with detailed descriptions of cooking methods and ingredientsÃ¢â‚¬â€from across the archipelago. Readers will want to try spicy Padang favorites from West Sumatra, healthy Javanese vegetable creations, succulent satays and barbecued poultry dishes from Bali and Lombok, and superb but lesser-known dishes from Kalimantan and the remote eastern isles of Indonesia. In addition to an astonishing array of exciting recipes, von Holzen provides background on a nation that encompasses the most astonishing physical and cultural diversity in Asia. Written and photographed by von Holzen, The Food of Indonesia makes it easy for anyone who has ever traveledÃ¢â‚¬â€or dreams of travelingÃ¢â‚¬â€to the Spice Islands to reproduce its irresistible, fresh flavors at home.\n\n\nCONTENTS\nFood in Indonesia 5\nTropical Islands of Spice and Rice 9\nAn Invitation to a Feast 14\nThe Indonesian Kitchen 17\nCooking Methods 18\nWrapping Foods in Banana\nLeaves 19\nAuthentic Indonesian\nIngredients 22\nPickles,Sambals and Dipping Sauces\nSalads and Appetizers\nRice and Noodles\nVegetable Dishes\nPoultry Dishes\nEgg Dishes\nSeafood Dishes\nMeat Dishes\nDesserts\nComplete list of recipes 112\nMeasurements and conversions 112","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67ea52e6b634d60851881607eeed94264e65aa4f","amp;dn":"The+Food+of+Indonesia++%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67ea52e6b634d60851881607eeed94264e65aa4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,234,82,230,182,52,214,8,81,136,22,7,238,237,148,38,78,101,170,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
