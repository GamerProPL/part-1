For animals there is just one goal in life--to continue their bloodline in the form of offspring. They are an animal's legacy for the future. The story of their journey is about hope, facing danger, actions of breath-taking boldness, extraordinary behaviours and, ultimately, success against the odds. \n\nThis spectacular series follows that journey through its six crucial stages: taking their first steps in the world, growing up, finding a home, gaining power, winning a mate and succeeding as a parent. Life Story brings a new level of story-telling to the landmark genre, creating an experience that is both intimate and intense. We follow the struggles and triumphs of individual animals, drawing the viewer into their worlds, to sense the danger, the challenges and the decisions they must face.\n\n\nPart: 3 Home\nAnimals must find somewhere to live - a place that provides the necessities of life, shelter from the elements and a refuge from enemies. Good homes are rare and competition can be intense - finding a home is one thing, but defending it is quite another. Home for a pack of African hunting dogs is a vast plain in Zambia. But it's far from safe. They must protect their young from predators and battle their age-old enemy, the hyena. Hermit crabs on an isolated tropical island make their homes in empty snail shells. But there is a severe housing shortage. When a new property washes ashore the crabs form an orderly queue, in order of size. It's a housing chain. When the chain is complete each crab moves into the newly-vacated shell ahead of it in the line. Chimps have made a home on the edge of the Sahara desert. They only survive by knowing how to find water even in the most extreme droughts. The elders lead their troop on a brutal trek to a dried-out riverbed. Once there they know exactly where to dig to create wells.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p026vg04&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p026vg04&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTechnical Specs \nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f6be9f919eb6bac2d8c7&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: 3007 Kbps \nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\nVideo Resolution: 1280 x 720\nAudio Codec: AAC LC\nAudio English \nAudio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\nAudio Channels: Stereo 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nContainer Mp4\nPart Size: 1.29 GB\nSource: HDrip\nEncoded by: Harry65 \n\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ce5349fe6b7df9cfb75e892f2f23557538aafa0","amp;dn":"BBC.Life.Story.3of6.Home.720p.HDrip.x264.AAC..mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ce5349fe6b7df9cfb75e892f2f23557538aafa0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,229,52,159,230,183,223,156,251,117,232,146,242,242,53,87,83,138,175,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
