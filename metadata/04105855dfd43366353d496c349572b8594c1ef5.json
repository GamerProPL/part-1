His ILIAD and ODYSSEY are the two oldest extant works of Western literature and have exerted an enormous influence on the history of literature.\n\nThe ILIAD is set during the Trojan War, the ten-year siege of the city of Troy (Ilium) by a coalition of Greek states, and tells of the battles and events during the weeks of a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles.\n\nThe ODYSSEY is, in part, a sequel to the Iliad, and mainly centers on the Greek hero Odysseus (known as Ulysses in Roman myths) and his journey home after the fall of Troy.\n\n\nIncluded here are 6 translations of the ILIAD and 9 translations of the ODYSSEY in a mix of EPUB and/or PDF formats as indicated below:\n\n* THE ILIAD (Penguin Classics, 1990).
