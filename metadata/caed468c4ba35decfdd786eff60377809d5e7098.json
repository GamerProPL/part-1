At about 55, he continues to win long-distance races in the US Masters year after year and his times are FASTER than the winners of all younger age groups down to about 18 -- if I recall correctly. \n\nGives you a stroke that not only greatly reduces wasted energy and exertion but is truly beautiful to watch.\n\nAs a young competitive swimmer, I won my age group's city freestyle championship two years in a row. And for more than 35 years, I've continued to try and improve my technique to help in my coaching of others. BUT I STILL FOUND PLENTY OF USEFUL GUIDANCE IN TI FME and still do so every day. Just the reduction in drag makes a tremendous difference.\n\nNot so easy to learn without a partner (buddy).\n\nPerhaps best mastered using an Endless Pool FastLane or equivalent. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.totalimmersion.net/freestyle-made-easy-dvd.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.totalimmersion.net/freestyle-made-easy-dvd.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&quot;FME empowers you to become your own best TI Coach.\nSince November 2002, the TI Buddy System' has transformed the learning process for TI students and our coaches. In the Buddy System, our coaches get in the water with two or more students and show them how to teach balance to each other using hands-on assistance, including towing, launching, and 'traction' to make mastery of balance easier and eliminate the struggle, discomfort and uncertainty that had afflicted some students. Using the Buddy System, our students were able to:\n\n    * Learn balance without struggle,\n    * Learn better by helping others solve the same problems,\n    * Benefit from a collaborative learning experience, and\n    * Experience what good balance feels like, and how little effort it takes to maintain it.&quot;\n\nOur swimming torrents: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5061036/Total_Immersion_Perpetual_Motion_Freestyle_2009_for_iPod&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5061036/Total_Immersion_Perpetual_Motion_Freestyle_2009_for_iPod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4745018/Total_Immersion_Freestyle_Made_Easy.avi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4745018/Total_Immersion_Freestyle_Made_Easy.avi&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4833280/Total_Immersion_Swimming_-_Four_Stokes_Made_Easy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4833280/Total_Immersion_Swimming_-_Four_Stokes_Made_Easy&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4832735/Swim_Fast__Michael_Phelps___Butterfly__Flying_Less&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4832735/Swim_Fast__Michael_Phelps___Butterfly__Flying_Less&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4832562/Swim_Fast__Lindsay_Benko_s_Freestyle&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4832562/Swim_Fast__Lindsay_Benko_s_Freestyle&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4834962/Swim_Fast__Series_-_Breastroke_According_to_Moses_&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4834962/Swim_Fast__Series_-_Breastroke_According_to_Moses_&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4835547/Ian_Thorpe_-_Beneath_the_Suit_&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4835547/Ian_Thorpe_-_Beneath_the_Suit_&lt;/a&gt;\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caed468c4ba35decfdd786eff60377809d5e7098","amp;dn":"Total+Immersion+Swimming+-+Freestyle+Made+Easy+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caed468c4ba35decfdd786eff60377809d5e7098","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,237,70,140,75,163,93,236,253,215,134,239,246,3,119,128,157,94,112,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
