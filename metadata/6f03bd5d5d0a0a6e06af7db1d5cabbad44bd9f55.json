He is less than clear, often times thinking that he is \r\nonly thirty-four years of age. But his story becomes more confusing after \r\nhe does focus on the fact of his current real age. He tells of his life at \r\nthree primary points in his life: at age nine (when his parents divorced), \r\nage sixteen and age thirty-four. The confusing aspect of the story is that \r\nhe tells of alternate life paths, often changing course with the flick of \r\na decision at each of those ages. One life path has him ultimately married \r\nto Elise, a depressed woman who never got over the unrequited love she had \r\nfor a guy named Stefano when she was a teenager and who asked Nemo to swear \r\nthat when she died he would sprinkle her ashes on Mars. A second life path \r\nhas him married to Jean. Their life is one of luxury but one also of utter \r\nboredom. And a third life path has him in a torrid romance with his step-\r\nsister Anna, the two who, as adults, would search for each other after \r\nhaving been torn apart as teenagers. These life paths also intersect, with \r\nthe three women sometimes entering the alternate life in some other aspect. \r\nAre any of these lives real or are they all a figment of his imagination?\r\n\r\n=&gt;-Jared Letos.\r\n=&gt;-Sarah Polley.\r\n=&gt;-Charlize Theron.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Jaco Van Dormael.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Sci-Fi : Drama : Fantasy.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2009.\r\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.95 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 795 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 2h 35mn.\r\n=&gt;-Chapters...................: 16 Named.\r\n=&gt;-Mr Nobody 2009.............: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485947/\r\n=&gt;-Mr Nobody 2009.............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mr-nobody/\r\n=&gt;-Mr Nobody 2009.............: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mr-nobody/\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.35:1.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 544.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 677 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 128 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 248 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f03bd5d5d0a0a6e06af7db1d5cabbad44bd9f55","amp;dn":"Mr+Nobody+-+Extended+DC+SciFi+2009+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f03bd5d5d0a0a6e06af7db1d5cabbad44bd9f55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,3,189,93,93,10,10,110,6,175,125,177,213,202,187,173,68,189,159,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
