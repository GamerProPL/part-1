Quizmaster Jimmy Carr asks questions from the entire history of mankind, giving the unique Big Fat Quiz spin on everything from politics to pop music, fashion to film and art to animals. Jimmy is ably assisted by big fat favourites such as Jon Snow, the children of Mitchell Brook Primary School and Joey Essex as well as a whole host of celebrity question setters. A couple of sleepy sloths hang around and some of the worldÃ¢Â€â„¢s greatest sculptures are brought to life in spectacular style. So, why was Bob Dylan famously booed on stage? What three things should you never do to a Mogwai? And what happens if youÃ¢Â€â„¢re bitten by the Brazilian wandering spider?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2498ecf70c043a3a5e6c97c9d8afbfc991ebcc12","amp;dn":"The+Big+Fat+Quiz+Of+Everything+S01E03+HDTV+x264-GTi%5Bstate%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2498ecf70c043a3a5e6c97c9d8afbfc991ebcc12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,152,236,247,12,4,58,58,94,108,151,201,216,175,191,201,145,235,204,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
