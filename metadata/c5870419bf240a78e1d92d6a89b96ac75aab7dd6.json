Weariness gives way to resilience and sorrow to joyous triumph in Smith's performances, and there's nobility in her delivery of even the sometimes tritely comic lyrics she sang. This is all five two-CD sets that gather all her known recordings. Smith was a presence when she first arrived in the studio: &quot;Downhearted Blues,&quot; her first record and already a hit for its composer, Alberta Hunter, would sell nearly 800,000 copies in its first six months of release. It's a riveting performance, but there's greater substance in her later work. There are many majestic performances here!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5870419bf240a78e1d92d6a89b96ac75aab7dd6","amp;dn":"Bessie+Smith+-+Complete+Recordings+-+Vol+1-5+%5Bmp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5870419bf240a78e1d92d6a89b96ac75aab7dd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,135,4,25,191,36,10,120,225,217,45,106,137,185,106,199,90,171,125,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
