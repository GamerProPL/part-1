The band's first album since 2009 will feature ten brand new tracks, including the infectiously melodic first single &quot;L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.&quot; \nLead singer Charlie Fink set to work on the album in January of 2010. Fink notes that the lyrics of the album were heavily influenced by poetry. Last year, he read the work of Frank O'Hara for the first time, falling in love with the poem Having A Coke With You. The album's title is also a nod towards Charles Bukowski's poetry collection The Last Night of the Earth -- Fink says he was attracted to the sense of &quot;loser's pride&quot; in Bukowski's work.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:818583518fe97bbc74d62dabbb0f254dbeb4a2d1","amp;dn":"Noah+and+the+Whale+-+Last+Night+on+Earth+%5Bmp3-256-2011%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"818583518fe97bbc74d62dabbb0f254dbeb4a2d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,133,131,81,143,233,123,188,116,214,45,171,187,15,37,77,190,180,162,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
