As you build momentum for Primal eating, you'll find that you won't even miss the bland, boring, low-fat foods that previously were the central focus of your diet. How can you argue with a menu that includes Roasted Leg of Lamb with Herbs and Garlic, Salmon Chowder with Coconut Milk, Tomatoes Stuffed with Ground Bison and Eggs, and Baked Chocolate Custard?\n\n This isn't a crash course diet. These and the other Primal recipes provide the foundation for a lifetime of delicious, healthy eating, high energy and protection from common health problems that arise from eating the SAD (Standard American Diet).\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd97c9836ae13713696306e59c4c90261a624373","amp;dn":"The+Primal+Blueprint+Cookbook%3A+Primal%2C+Low+Carb%2C+Paleo%2C+Grain-Fr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd97c9836ae13713696306e59c4c90261a624373","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,151,201,131,106,225,55,19,105,99,6,229,156,76,144,38,26,98,67,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
