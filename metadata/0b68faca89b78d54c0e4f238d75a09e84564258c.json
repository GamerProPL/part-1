Of those cars, a select few stand above the rest and join the vaunted group of vehicles known as Consumer Reports' Top Picks.\r\n\r\nTo become a Top Pick, a car must excel at the publication's track tests, offer average or better reliability, perform effectively in government or industry crash tests, and return high owner-satisfaction scores in Consumer Reports' surveys.\r\n\r\nThis year's Top Picks cover a wide variety of models ranging from small roadsters to full-size pickup trucks. In total, 10 cars were chosen, with seven from Japanese brands, two from American brands, and one from a Korean brand.\r\n\r\nSo here they are, Consumer Reports' Top Picks of 2016.\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/shtihl22\r\n\r\n=======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b68faca89b78d54c0e4f238d75a09e84564258c","amp;dn":"Consumer+Reports+-+New+Cars+-+November+2016+True+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b68faca89b78d54c0e4f238d75a09e84564258c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,104,250,202,137,183,141,84,192,228,242,56,215,90,9,232,69,100,37,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
