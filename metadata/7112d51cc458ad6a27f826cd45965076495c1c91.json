The Thirteenth Edition revises all the Examples and Problem-Solving Strategies to be more concise and direct while maintaining the Twelfth Edition's consistent, structured approach and strong focus on modeling as well as math. To help students tackle challenging as well as routine problems, the Thirteenth Edition adds Bridging Problems to each chapter, which pose a difficult, multiconcept problem and provide a skeleton solution guide in the form of questions and hints.\n\nThe text's rich problem sets - developed and refined over six decades - are upgraded to include larger numbers of problems that are biomedically oriented or require calculus. The problem-set revision is driven by detailed student-performance data gathered nationally through MasteringPhysicsÃ‚Â®, making it possible to fine-tune the reliability, effectiveness, and difficulty of individual problems.\n\nComplementing the clear and accessible text, the figures use a simple graphic style that focuses on the physics. They also incorporate explanatory annotations - a technique demonstrated to enhance learning.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHugh D. Young is Emeritus Professor of Physics at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. He attended Carnegie Mellon for both undergraduate and graduate study and earned his Ph.D. in fundamental particle theory under the direction of the late Richard Cutkosky.\n\nHe joined the faculty of Carnegie Mellon in 1956 and has also spent two years as a Visiting Professor at the University of California at Berkeley. Professor Young's career has centered entirely on undergraduate education. He has written several undergraduate-level textbooks, and in 1973 he became a co-author with Francis Sears and Mark Zemansky for their well-known introductory texts.\n\nWith their deaths, he assumed full responsibility for new editions of these books until joined by Prof. Freedman for University Physics. Professor Young is an enthusiastic skier, climber, and hiker. He also served for several years as Associate Organist at St. Paul's Cathedral in Pittsburgh, and has played numerous organ recitals in the Pittsburgh area. Prof. Young and his wife Alice usually travel extensively in the summer, especially in Europe and in the desert canyon country of southern Utah.\n\n\nRoger A. Freedman is a Lecturer in Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Dr. Freedman was an undergraduate at the University of California campuses in San Diego and Los Angeles, and did his doctoral research in nuclear theory at Stanford University under the direction of Professor J. Dirk Walecka.\n\nHe came to UCSB in 1981 after three years teaching and doing research at the University of Washington. At UCSB, Dr. Freedman has taught in both the Department of Physics and the College of Creative Studies, a branch of the university intended for highly gifted and motivated undergraduates.\n\nHe has published research in nuclear physics, elementary particle physics, and laser physics. In recent years, he has helped to develop computer-based tools for learning introductory physics and astronomy. When not in the classroom or slaving over a computer, Dr. Freedman can be found either flying (he holds a commercial pilot's license) or driving with his wife, Caroline, in their 1960 Nash Metropolitan convertible.\n\n\nA. Lewis Ford is Professor of Physics at Texas A&amp;M University. He received a B.A. from Rice University in 1968 and a Ph.D. in chemical physics from the University of Texas at Austin in 1972. After a one-year postdoc at Harvard University, he joined the Texas A&amp;M physics faculty in 1973 and has been there ever since. Professor Ford's research area is theoretical atomic physics, with a specialization in atomic collisions. At Texas A&amp;M he has taught a variety of undergraduate and graduate courses, but primarily introductory physics.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo Password or Surveys.
