His two long-running podcasts are among the most popular in the world. Part storyteller, part analyst, Carlin has mastered the art of looking at subjects from multiple angles and dissecting and thinking about them in original ways. He isnâ€™t afraid to go deep or to inject historical context into modern debates. Whether itâ€™s history or current events heâ€™s discussing, his passion is contagious, his approach refreshing and his ideas tickle your brain in all the right places. Heâ€™ll make you mad too.
