They travel without a\nbackup band, and on their first full-length album, Barton Hollow, the bare-bones\nlive arrangements that fans hear on the road are fleshed out with just the\nbarest of acoustic accoutrements. Each song is an intimate conversation, and no\nthird wheels or dinner-party chatter are going to interrupt that gorgeous,\nhaunting hush.\n\nOn the other hand, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been something distinctly loud about the duoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nintroduction to the world, even prior to the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s release. Their signature\nsong ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPoison &amp; WineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was heard on GreyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s AnatomyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in the foreground, in its\nentirety, over a key climactic montage, prompting hundreds of thousands of\nviewers to Google the mystery music. And they got a wholly unsolicited\nendorsement when AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s biggest pop star gave The Civil Wars a seal of\napproval. After first tweeting her love for the duo, fellow Nashvillian Taylor\nSwift included ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPoison &amp; WineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as a selection in her official iTunes playlist,\nsaying, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI think this is my favorite duet. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s exquisite.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nSwift took the words right out of the folk-country-Americana worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mouth. If\nit looks like The Civil WarsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ appeal might cast a net that extends well beyond\nthe typical audience for acoustically based music, that may be due to the\ninherent sensibilities Williams and White bring to their collaboration, which\nare quite disparate, if not necessarily warring. Both were gigging and recording\non their own prior to teaming up a year and a half ago, neither solo career\nquite suggesting what their conjoined sound would turn out to be. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI do\nnaturally bend pop,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Williams, who adds that she ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgrew up on Billie\nHolliday and The Beach Boys.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ White, meanwhile, was raised on Kristofferson,\nCash, and Townes Van Zandt by his retro-country-favoring dad. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSomehow weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re\npulling from each other what we crave and what our strengths are,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he says.\n\nIf the music ultimately leans more toward WhiteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s native South than WilliamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\nnorthern Cali roots, he says, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI think JoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s got some hillbillies in her\nancestry or something like that. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a song on our record called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“My\nFatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s FatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ that we wrote on the day of the inauguration down in Muscle\nShoals, not long after we got together. I started playing the guitar figure and\nshe starting singing this amazing Appalachian kind of melody, and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m like,\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even pretend that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re the pop girl and you come out with shit like\nthat!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know where this stuff is coming from, but sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s drawing it from\nsomewhere, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s amazing.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPoison &amp; WineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t just The Civil WarsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ breakout song. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also a thematic\ndeclaration of intent for this utterly complementary odd couple, encapsulating\neverything suggested in the duoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s name when it comes to exploring the conflicts\nthat arise as part of couplehood. Speaking of which: They arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a couple,\nthat is. But theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re far from insulted if you mistake them for An Item in the\nstoried tradition of the Swell Season, Richard and Linda Thompson, or other\nfamous duos whose on-again, off-again relationships offstage complicated their\nstage relations.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA lot of people think that weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re married, and I think thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s actually quite\nflattering, to be honest,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says White. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBecause we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want people to think\nthat weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re up here acting and feigning the emotions that we write and sing about\nand show on stage. But one of the things that really make this special in our\neyes is that if she and I were in a relationship together, it'd be a totally\ndifferent act. We would write totally different songs. I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think we would be\nable to go on stage every night and sing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t love you.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think a\nhealthy relationship could withstand that every single night. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s areas we\ncan delve into that wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t make sense for somebody thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\ntill-death-do-us-part. I think thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also a tension there that wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be\nthere if it was something that was just rote, something that was an everyday\nrelationship. We try to use that to our advantage.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPoison &amp; WineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ fits the paradigm of subject matter too true to be spoken, as\nopposed to sung. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThat song probably does sum us upÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Civil Wars, the name of\nthe bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as well as any song that weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve written,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ White says. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the one song\non the album written with an outside collaborator, their friend Chris Lindsey.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re all married, and we were all talking about the good, the bad and the\nugly, and just felt like: What would you say to someone if you were actually\nbrutally honestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the things that you could never say because it would turn them\naway or let the cat out of the bag or reveal yourself to be weaker? What would\nyou actually say if you had this invisible curtain around you and could just\nscream it in somebodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s face and theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d actually never hear it? We were all\nbeing very painfully honest, because weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re all very comfortable around each\nother and know that things like that never leave the room, except in a song. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m\npretty proud of that song, to be honest.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nWhen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPoison &amp; WineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was heard in its entirety on GreyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s AnatomyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½versus in the\nbackground, for a few seconds, as Williams and White had expectedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½they knew that\nif the showÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s audience liked what they heard, it would put their search skills\nto the test. The title only pops up in a verse, not the chorus, so it involved\nsome ingenuity or intuition to track the tune down. Fortunately, viewers proved\nup to the test of finding, and choosing, their ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPoison.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ At last count, the\nsongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s official YouTube video had been viewed 400,000 times.\n\nWhite and Williams met in 2008 on what he describes as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œblind date, getting\nstuck in a room together, not knowing anything about each other.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ This was a\nstrictly professional blind date. As Williams recalls, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI got a call for whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\ncalled a writing camp, where several writers were called together to work on\ntrying to write several radio singles for a particular country band. Though I\nlive in Nashville, I worked mostly in L.A. and came more out of the pop world,\nso I was like, why did they call me? John Paul definitely wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t bringing a\nMusic Row sensibility in when he was coming into the write, either, but neither\nof us knew that about each other. In that room, it was almost 20 writers,\nbasically drawing straws and getting to know each other a little bit. And when\nhe started singing, I somehow knew where he was heading musically and could\nfollow him, without ever having met him before. And that had never happened to\nme.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve done lots of co-writes and collaborative situations, but IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d never felt\nthat weird spark,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ agrees WhiteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthat weird familiarity like weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d been in a\nfamily band or something most of our lives. The beautiful part of it was that\nneither one of us would let on, so we both played it cool for a while, saying\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“That went well, we should write another,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and so on. I worked up enough nerve\ntoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½so to speakÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ask her out. But there was a lot of scuffing my heel on the floor\nand ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know what youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re doing for a while, but IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got this guitar, and\nyou sing pretty good, but you probably donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re so much better than\nI am. Never mind. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m just gonna go.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Luckily she felt the same way.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nMonths later, they did their first show as The Civil Wars at the French Quarter\nCafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© in NashvilleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½where their future producer, Charlie Peacock, was in\nattendance and definitely taking notice. Their second show was at a club called\nEddieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Attic in Decatur, Georgia, and it was attended by roughly 100,000 fans.\nAt least, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s how many people have downloaded Live at EddieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Attic, a free\ndigital album, from their website.\n\nThe set included eight originals plus a cover of Leonard CohenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDance Me to\nthe End of Love.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even rehearse that much for that show, and we were\nflying by the seat of our pants,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ recalls White. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBut the sound guy at EddieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nis legendary for doing really great board takes, and we listened to the tape on\nthe way home and were pretty amazed at the quality of the recording. So we\nthought, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“What the hell, letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s see what other people think about it.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ The beauty\nof putting that thing out as early as we did is, we could always fall back on:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Well, it was our second showÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he laughs.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLooking back, John Paul and I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t believe we put out our second show ever,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nWilliams says. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHopefully you can hear the growth from then to now. But IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m\nreally glad that we did. To get emails now like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“A buddy of mine in South Africa\njust sent me Live at EddieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Attic,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ or somebody coming up to us and saying\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Yeah, my friend in New Zealand was the one that told me about you guysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in\nAlabama, where we were doing a relatively local showÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that really took us by\nsurprise, the way it started a conversation nationally and internationally.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe Live at EddieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Attic release also had some other happy, unintended\nconsequences. Williams feels that the loose chatter between songs helped\nestablish that, as personalities, the two of them arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t always (or even\nusually) as somber as their breakout song might suggest. More importantly, it\nestablished them as a fully functional duo that might be harmed more than helped\nby the addition of a slew of hired hands.\n\nWhen it comes to keeping ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to an un-band-like two people, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nprobably 10 different reasons for that,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ explains White. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSome of it is\nlogistics. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s so much easier for two people to get into a car. But it just\nfelt like releasing that record with just the two of us also put that stripped\ndown, more organic, more raw kind of sound in peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s minds. And we felt like\nit was more emotional and told the story a lot better. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just she and I and a\nguitar and piano. If thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s something that is lacking, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gonna be painfully\nobvious. So the songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guts have to be strong, at least for us, from front to\nback.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nNo frills means no distractions from the quality of their blended voices. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nthe strangest thing when I sing with her,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ White says. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEven the things we do\nwith vibrato, typically, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re the sameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½we speed up and slow down at the same\npace. SheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll ad-lib something live, and the next time around, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll sing the\nharmony to it. But if I sat and thought about it, I couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t do it.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ For\nWilliams, whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sold hundreds of thousands of records recording on her own,\nsharing the vocals is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œone of my favorite things about The Civil Wars, because\nwhen youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a solo artist, you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t harmonize while singing the lead. To me,\nall harmony is active listening.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s something circuitously satisfying about the fact that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œactive listeningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nis taking place on-stage at The Civil Wars shows as well as among the audience,\nheightening the sensation that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a conversation being eavesdropped on, not\njust a performance. So much synchronization to go aroundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ but also so much\ndelicious tension, as the duo hardly shy away from the conflict that gives them\ntheir moniker. Harmonious discord, thy name is The Civil Wars.\n\nWhite and Williams are never going to forge a complete meeting of the minds.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be a redneck once IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m through with you,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he tells her, teasingly. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOh,\njust try!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ she taunts him. Still a northern California girl after this many\nyears in Nashville, she says, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI still canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t say ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“yÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢all.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ I still canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t say\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“fixinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ to.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ John Paul, you say ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“might couldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ a lot, which freaks me out. But\nyeah, somewhere in there, if itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s only in the melodies, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m happy to absorb all\nthat.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nAnd to dish it back out in the form of universal narratives that are both\nelliptical and emotional. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAfter all the writing IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve done for other artists or\nwriting for TV/film or solo music,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Williams, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe ability for John Paul\nand I to share stories of whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s happened in our lives, either current or past,\nand let those inform the way that we write intrinsically makes us care more\nabout it. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got songs that deal directly with loss that weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve had in our own\npasts. The opening song, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Twenty Years,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is actually about a family secret, more\non my side of the family. We love to write about these things and hint at it\nwhile not giving the whole thing away. If the stories that weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re singing about\nand the things that weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re speaking of are true, hopefully theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll draw out the\nstories of the people who are listening, and that can create some invisible\ncycle of safety and exhilaration and freedom, and of being transported somewhere\nelse for a little moment in time.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nSomewhere likeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Barton Hollow? Where is the titular location, anyway? ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI guess\nitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s something to do with the picturesque quality of the phrase,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ admits White.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a phrase that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not gonna Google and find, whatsoever. I found that\nout the other day. There is no Barton Hollow, that I can find.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ But a few\nminutes later, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s changed his tune, declaring: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBarton Hollow is actually a\nplace that I grew up. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a little geographic place close to where I grew up\nand did a lot of illicit activities,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ White continues, embellishing as he goes,\nwhile his partner dissolves into helpless laughter.
