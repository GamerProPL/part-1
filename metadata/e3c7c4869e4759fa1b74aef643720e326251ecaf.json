It includes singles &quot;Take a Walk,&quot; &quot;I'll Be Alright&quot; and &quot;Constant Conversations.&quot; Be advised that the sixth song, &quot;Cry Like a Ghost,&quot; seems to skip around a minute and a half in. It's a minor error and I haven't spotted any other issues, so I hope you enjoy the album as much as I did. (My personal favorite is &quot;Carried Away.&quot;) It's set to be released on July 23, 2012. Please seed!\n\n1. Take a Walk (4:25)\n2. I'll Be Alright (4:23)\n3. Carried Away (3:42)\n4.
