The book is divided into four parts, opening with a section on classic, composite materials including wood and stone, brick, and ceramic, then moving on to building materials that have been refined and updated for home use from glass, concrete, and metal to rubber and tiles. \n\nThe final section is devoted to sustainable materials and the environmental impact of our choices.
