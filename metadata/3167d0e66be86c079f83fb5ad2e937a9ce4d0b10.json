On the agenda are his TV idols from both science fiction and science fact, as well as a whole universe of other stuff.\nHost Cox is celebrating the long-standing history of science broadcasting and communication, and has invited actor and adventurer Blessed, as well as Coast and Horizon presenter Professor Alice Roberts, along to help him prove his point.\nThe trio touch on everything from the Moon landings to Patrick Moore, from Carl Sagan to Blake's Seven, as they demonstrate how, for as long as there has been video technology, there have been people eager to use it in the name of science.\nThere's also a look at what the future holds for the medium - can it help prove if we really are alone in the universe?\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs \nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;3e765759567e720a100f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: 3020 Kbps \nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\nVideo Resolution: 1280 x 720\nAudio Codec: AAC LC\nAudio English \nAudio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\nAudio Channels: Stereo 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber of Parts: 4\nContainer Mp4\nPart Size: average 1.28 GB\nSource: HDTV\nEncoded by: Harry65 \n\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tvrage.com/brian-cox-space-time-and-videotape&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tvrage.com/brian-cox-space-time-and-videotape&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3167d0e66be86c079f83fb5ad2e937a9ce4d0b10","amp;dn":"BBC.Brian.Cox.Space.Time.And.Videotape.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC..mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3167d0e66be86c079f83fb5ad2e937a9ce4d0b10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,103,208,230,107,232,108,7,159,131,251,90,210,233,55,169,206,77,11,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
