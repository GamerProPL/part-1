However, Japan in 1946 was under American Occupation, and prepublication censorship was one facet of Occupation activities. The initial censor reacted sympathetically to parts of the text, stating that â€œthe young author reports, it seems, anything and everything as he saw and as he heard with his own eyes and with his own ears. There is very little exaggeration, if any, but the effect is so penetrating and touching.â€\r\n\r\nBut the censor considered the work as a whole objectionable. He wrote: â€œHere is an instance of the Japanese militaristic spirit . . . viewed from inside. The simple attitude of the author and the vivid style of {Requiem} as well as the extremely impressive contents themselves cannot fail to arouse in the mind of the readers something like deep regret for the lost great battleship, and who can be sure that the warlike portion of the Japanese do not yearn after another war in which they may give another Yamato a better chance?â€ Permission to publish was denied","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:011a830258b4d5efabb5a21790c3c443f822a869","amp;dn":"Requiem+for+Battleship+Yamato","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"011a830258b4d5efabb5a21790c3c443f822a869","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,26,131,2,88,180,213,239,171,181,162,23,144,195,196,67,248,34,168,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
