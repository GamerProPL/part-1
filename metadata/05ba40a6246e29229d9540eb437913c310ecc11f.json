S., as imagined during the Cold War. One may ask who are the luckiest - those who are killed, or those who survive.\n\n\nPicture quality is not great, I suspect that my DVD was a bootleg, but the film is so rare that it's worth watching. Quality is much better than a VHSrip.\n\nLook out for a very young Steve Guttenberg (Cocoon, The Boys from Brazil)\n\nWidescreen, original mono.\nXviD 576x320, AC3.\n127 minutes, so I'll give it 800 Mb.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05ba40a6246e29229d9540eb437913c310ecc11f","amp;dn":"The+Day+After+%281983%29+-+Nuclear+War+DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05ba40a6246e29229d9540eb437913c310ecc11f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,186,64,166,36,110,41,34,157,149,64,235,67,121,19,195,16,236,193,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
