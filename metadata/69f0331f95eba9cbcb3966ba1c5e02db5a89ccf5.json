But what he did not know is that this event would trigger a massive climate shift that would effect the world population. Meanwhile, his son, Sam was with friends in New York to attend an event. There they discover that it has been raining non-stop for the past 3 weeks, and after a series of weather related disasters that occurred over the world. Everybody soon realizes that the world is going to enter a new ice age, as the rest of the world population tries to evacuate to the warm climates of the south. Jack makes a daring attempt to rescue his son and his friends who are stuck in New York, who have to survive not only a massive wave, but freezing cold temperatures that could possibly kill them.\n\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img130.imageshack.us/img130/5439/vlcsnap2010121014h11m57.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img130.imageshack.us/img130/5439/vlcsnap2010121014h11m57.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img207.imageshack.us/img207/2871/vlcsnap2010121014h12m12.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img207.imageshack.us/img207/2871/vlcsnap2010121014h12m12.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/9057/vlcsnap2010121014h11m59.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/9057/vlcsnap2010121014h11m59.png&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69f0331f95eba9cbcb3966ba1c5e02db5a89ccf5","amp;dn":"The+Day+After+Tomorrow+%282004%29+720p+-+550mb+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69f0331f95eba9cbcb3966ba1c5e02db5a89ccf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,240,51,31,149,235,169,203,203,57,102,186,28,94,2,219,90,137,204,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
