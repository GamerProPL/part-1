Thomas Wolfe wrote standing up in the kitchen, the top of the refrigerator as his desk, dreamily fondling his Ã¢â‚¬Å“male configurationsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. . . Jean-Paul Sartre chewed on Corydrane tablets (a mix of amphetamine and aspirin), ingesting ten times the recommended dose each day . . . Descartes liked to linger in bed, his mind wandering in sleep through woods, gardens, and enchanted palaces where he experienced Ã¢â‚¬Å“every pleasure imaginable.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nHere are: Anthony Trollope, who demanded of himself that each morning he write three thousand words (250 words every fifteen minutes for three hours) before going off to his job at the postal service, which he kept for thirty-three years during the writing of more than two dozen books . . . Karl Marx . . . Woody Allen . . . Agatha Christie . . . George Balanchine, who did most of his work while ironing . . . Leo Tolstoy . . . Charles Dickens . . . Pablo Picasso . . . George Gershwin, who, said his brother Ira, worked for twelve hours a day from late morning to midnight, composing at the piano in pajamas, bathrobe, and slippers . . .\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2259ad2b67be2f97f599c156fb2d6fc75c9e57f0","amp;dn":"Daily+Rituals%3A+How+Artists+Work","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2259ad2b67be2f97f599c156fb2d6fc75c9e57f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,89,173,43,103,190,47,151,245,153,193,86,251,45,111,199,92,158,87,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
