Through a series of exercises that emphasize improvisation and risk-taking, readers will learn how to quiet their inner critics and strengthen their creativity. The more we learn to play and accept whatever appears on the page, the more we are able to try new things in life. Readers will be inspired by BarryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delightful full-color paintings featured throughout the book.\n\nAbout the Author\nBarbara Diane Barry is an artist and art teacher in New York City.
