All three musicians Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Norah Jones, Sasha Dobson and Catherine Popper Ã¢â‚¬â€ keep themselves busy with solo day jobs that range from in-demand supporting musicians to full-time superstars, but Puss N Boots affords the trio an opportunity to indulge in their shared love of country and other pieces of ramshackle Americana.\nJones has another part-time country band, but where sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the frontwoman for the Little Willies, Puss N Boots is decidedly a collaborative affair, finding Jones, Dobson, and Popper harmonizing and trading leads, often within the course ofÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\na song. The group follows no straight path and neither does No Fools, No Fun. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s half covers, half originals, part live and part studio, the different parts sitting side by side, adding up to a curious record whose raggedness feels like a statement of purpose. Puss N Boots celebrates the moments that donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t add up, the places where the present blurs with the past, delivering songs with a sly wink that camouflages a teary eye. No Fools, No Fun is never rowdy Ã¢â‚¬â€ the closest it comes is the train-track beat of JonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ original Ã¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Know What It MeansÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an earthiness to the trioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chemistry that signals how deeply the group knows each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strengths and weaknesses. This is where Puss N BootsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ long history of woodshedding pays off: far from sounding like a busmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s holiday, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a shared past thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s evident in every moment of this debut, and that natural, relaxed camaraderie is the reason why No Fools, No Fun is such an appealing listen.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01be5b4b4686d242a84ecbd16edbc6c47c68779a","amp;dn":"%28Norah+Jones%29+Puss+N+Boots+-+No+Fools+No+Fun+%282014%29+MP3%40320kbps+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01be5b4b4686d242a84ecbd16edbc6c47c68779a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,190,91,75,70,134,210,66,168,78,203,209,110,219,198,196,124,104,119,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
