Among MoliÃ¨re's best known works are The Misanthrope (1666), The School for Wives (1662), Tartuffe (1664), The Miser (1668), The Bourgeois Gentleman (1670), and The Imaginary Invalid (1673) -- some of the most durable and penetratingly satirical full-length comedies of all time.\r\n\r\nAlthough the sacred and secular authorities of 17th-century France often combined against him, the genius of MoliÃ¨re finally emerged to win him acclaim.  He employed most of the traditional forms of comedy but succeeded in inventing a new style that was based on a double vision of normal and abnormal seen in relation to each other -- the comedy of the true opposed to the specious, the intelligent seen alongside the pedantic.  An actor himself, MoliÃ¨re seems to have been incapable of visualizing any situation without animating and dramatizing it, often beyond the limits of probability; though living in an age of reason, his own good sense led him not to proselytize but rather to animate the absurd.  It is testimony to the freshness of his vision that the greatest comic artists working centuries later in other media, such as Charlie Chaplin, have been compared to MoliÃ¨re.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are in PDF or ePUB format as indicated:\r\n\r\n* Bungler, The (Theatre Communications Group, 2010).
