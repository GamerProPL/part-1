In California, a world leader in observational astronomy at a time when America's space programme was at its height, the astronomers spent their formative years developing friendships that would last a lifetime, and making scientific discoveries that would change the course of history.\r\nTogether they represent the most productive period astronomy has ever had. Their journey through the southwestern United States allows them to see once again the places and landscape they explored as young men. Now in their 70s, they share their reflections on a life spent looking at the universe.\r\nStar Men celebrates the history of stargazing: the inventions and discoveries that have enabled us to learn so much about the universe, but more importantly to understand how much more we have yet to discover.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5e/Star-Men-BBC-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/41/Star-Men-BBC-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/Star-Men-BBC-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/82/Star-Men-BBC-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Star-Men-BBC-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/05/Star-Men-BBC-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/46/Star-Men-BBC-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/92/Star-Men-BBC-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b4/Star-Men-BBC-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~2191Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.46 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 972 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07xjh6z","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24c7e364abcc4b80ba25fe4695b8627cb68f99f7","amp;dn":"BBC+Star+Men+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24c7e364abcc4b80ba25fe4695b8627cb68f99f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,199,227,100,171,204,75,128,186,37,254,70,149,184,98,124,182,143,153,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
