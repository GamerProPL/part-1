Barrett's Build-It-Yourself Science Laboratory is a classic book that took on an audacious task: to show young readers in the 1960s how to build a complete working science lab for chemistry, biology, and physics--and how to perform experiments with those tools. The experiments in this book are fearless and bold by today's standards--any number of the experiments might never be mentioned in a modern book for young readers! Yet, many from previous generations fondly remember how we as a society used to embrace scientific learning. \r\n\r\nThis new version of Barrett's book has been updated for today's world with annotations and updates from Windell Oskay of Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories, including extensive notes about modern safety practices, suggestions on where to find the parts you need, and tips for building upon Barrett's ideas with modern technology. With this book, you'll be ready to take on your own scientific explorations at school, work, or home","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fee60ebd3d762689ec1a802012e131ad84ed7e48","amp;dn":"Make+-+The+Annotated+Build-It-Yourself+Science+Laboratory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fee60ebd3d762689ec1a802012e131ad84ed7e48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,230,14,189,61,118,38,137,236,26,128,32,18,225,49,173,132,237,126,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
