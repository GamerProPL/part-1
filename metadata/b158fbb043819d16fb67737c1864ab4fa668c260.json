Every breath of air is loaded with information. In fact, what every dog the tracking dog, of course, but also the dog lying next to you, snoring, on the couch knows about the world comes mostly through his nose. \r\n\r\nIn Being a Dog, Alexandra Horowitz, a research scientist in the field of dog cognition and the author of the runaway bestseller Inside of a Dog, unpacks the mystery of a dog s worldview as has never been done before. \r\nWith her family dogs, Finnegan and Upton, leading the way, Horowitz sets off on a quest to make sense of scents, combining a personal journey of smelling with a tour through the cutting edge and improbable science behind the olfactory powers of the dog. From revealing the spectacular biology of the dog snout, to speaking to other cognitive researchers and smell experts across the country, to visiting detection-dog training centers and even attempting to smell-train her own nose, Horowitz covers the topic of noses both canine and human from surprising, novel, and always fascinating angles. \r\n\r\nAs we come to understand how complex the world around us appears to the canine nose, Horowitz changes our perspective on dogs forever. Readers will finish this book feeling that they have smelled into a fourth dimension breaking free of human constraints and understanding smell as never before; that they have, however fleetingly, been a dog.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b158fbb043819d16fb67737c1864ab4fa668c260","amp;dn":"Being+a+Dog+%282016%29+%28Epub%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b158fbb043819d16fb67737c1864ab4fa668c260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,88,251,176,67,129,157,22,251,103,115,124,24,100,171,79,166,104,194,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
