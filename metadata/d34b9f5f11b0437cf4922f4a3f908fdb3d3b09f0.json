Ã¢â‚¬Å“Weight of LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the sort of uproar most bands would save for a big finish. But the Keys Ã¢â‚¬â€œ singer-guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and their co-producer Brian Burton, a.k.a. Danger Mouse, show their nerve upfront in a mounting tension of acoustic guitar and painted-desert ambience, cut open by AuerbachÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢s machete-treble twang and battered by CarneyÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unhurried John Bonham-like rolls. When Auerbach finally gets to the chorus, he sings it as high-pitched warning (Ã¢â‚¬Å“DonÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢t give yourself away/To the weight of loveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), lined with plenty of gospel-sisters heat.\nIn one sense, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Weight of LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the KeysÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢ return to basics: a heavy blues. In every other way, that turmoil is a giant step into the best, most consistently gripping album the Keys have ever made. And that includes their 2010 smash, Brothers.\n\nThat LPÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢s crunchy mix of Sixties soul and Midwest-garage glam was a rightful breakthrough. Turn Blue is a genuine turning point Ã¢â‚¬â€œ into a decisively original rock, with a deeper shade of blues. You still get the minimalist vigor of the KeysÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢ first records a decade ago. But this is more brazen severity, richer and forward in its hip-hop allusions, super-size-rock dynamics, pictorial studio flourishes and offbeat commercial savvy. With its seething close-up bass runs and deathwatch vocal chorus, Ã¢â‚¬Å“In TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an aggressive update of Sly StoneÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢s paranoia in ThereÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a Riot GoinÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢ On with a spaghetti-Western splash of Ennio Morricone. Ã¢â‚¬Å“FeverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a bizarre, knockout union of bar-band grease and Euro-disco concision Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kraftwerk in gas-station overalls. The Keys have been working up to this since their first LP with Burton, 2008's Attack &amp; Release. Turn Blue sounds like arrival.\n\nBurton is practically a bandmate here, playing keyboards and co-writing all 11 songs (and co-producing all but two). He is also an expert magnifier and coloring agent, the likely hand behind the croaking electronics in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Turn BlueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the fattened thwack in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Year in Review.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But the Keys are still a two-man band. Their strict, primary force binds and propels the extra textures as well as AuerbachÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢s flinty verdicts on love always going wrong. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I let you use my gifts/To back those lyinÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢ lips,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he snaps in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bullet in the Brain,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a gnashing rage in lavish reverb. Ã¢â‚¬Å“In Our PrimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has less echo but more dirty guitar, curdled organ and a soul interlude with an orchestral hint of keyboards. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I see a face from way back when/And I explode,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Auerbach sings before he and Carney blow up at the end. ItÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not Muddy WatersÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢ lingo. ItÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢s still blues.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Gotta Get AwayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an unexpected finish: straight-arrow rock with a hot chorus, the way the ClashÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Train in VainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was a hit-single exclamation point on London Calling. Turn Blue is as apocalyptic, in its way, as that Clash epic: loaded with risk, distress and payoff. But when Auerbach sings, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blacktop, I canÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stop,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ at the end, over CarneyÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢s open-road stride, they sound like a band already on to the next crossroads.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n     ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d34b9f5f11b0437cf4922f4a3f908fdb3d3b09f0","amp;dn":"The+Black+Keys+-+Turn+Blue+%282014%29+FLAC+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d34b9f5f11b0437cf4922f4a3f908fdb3d3b09f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,75,159,95,17,176,67,124,244,146,47,74,63,144,143,219,61,59,9,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
