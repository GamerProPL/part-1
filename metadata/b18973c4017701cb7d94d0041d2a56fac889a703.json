Rather, it was pervasive and systematic, the predictable consequence of official orders to &quot;kill anything that moves.&quot;\r\n\r\nDrawing on more than a decade of research into secret Pentagon archives and extensive interviews with American veterans and Vietnamese survivors, Turse reveals for the first time the workings of a military machine that resulted in millions of innocent civilians killed and wounded - what one soldier called &quot;a My Lai a month.&quot; Devastating and definitive, &quot;Kill Anything That Moves&quot; finally brings us face-to-face with the truth of a war that haunts America to this day","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b18973c4017701cb7d94d0041d2a56fac889a703","amp;dn":"Kill+Anything+That+Moves%3A+The+Real+American+War+in+Vietnam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b18973c4017701cb7d94d0041d2a56fac889a703","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,137,115,196,1,119,1,203,125,148,208,4,29,42,86,250,200,137,167,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
