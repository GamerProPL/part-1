Author John Michael Greer seeks to answer this question, and with some degree of accuracy, since civilizations tend to collapse in remarkably similar ways.\r\n\r\nDark Age America, then, seeks to map out in advance the history of collapse, giving us an idea of what the next five hundred years or so might look like as globalization ends and North American civilization reaches the end of its lifecycle and enters the stages of decline and fall.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, this is Greer's most uncompromising work, though by no means without hope to offer. Knowing where we're headed collectively is a crucial step in responding constructively to the challenges of the future and doing what we can now to help our descendants make the most of the world we're leaving them","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5650b560296b88806a8a34cd7dac08ef0d65bbd4","amp;dn":"Dark+Age+America+%3A+Climate+Change%2C+Cultural+Collapse%282016+WWRG%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5650b560296b88806a8a34cd7dac08ef0d65bbd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,80,181,96,41,107,136,128,106,138,52,205,125,172,8,239,13,101,187,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
