Luckily, the trio seems enamored by most of the same songs that the general public is, resulting in one of those rare &quot;greatest-hits&quot; collections that goes deep without depriving the listener of the essentials. With tunes like &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot;, &quot;Caribbean Blue&quot;, and &quot;Book of Days&quot; in the pot and out of the way, it's easier to appreciate hidden gems like &quot;Cursum Perficio&quot;, &quot;Boadicea&quot;, &quot;Trains and Winter Rains&quot;, and &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;. Also notable is the inclusion of &quot;May It Be&quot; and a previously unreleased version of &quot;AnÃƒÂ­ron (I Desire)&quot;, both of which originally appeared on the soundtrack for the first chapter of Peter Jackson's beloved Lord of the Rings trilogy.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a322bc7874d60c1babb1c6a67118420174b9d566","amp;dn":"ENYA+-+The+Very+Best+of+Enya+%28Remastered%29+iTunes+Album+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a322bc7874d60c1babb1c6a67118420174b9d566","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,34,188,120,116,214,12,27,171,177,198,166,113,24,66,1,116,185,213,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
