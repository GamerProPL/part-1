After touring with a British classical ensemble, she accepted a publishing job. Meanwhile, she sang with a series of local groups before joining the trip-hop outfit Faithless - helmed by her older brother, the noted DJ and producer Rollo - in 1995. The group released its debut album, Reverence, the following year. It went on to sell over five million copies worldwide, and Dido parlayed her newfound success into a solo deal with Arista Records.\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Here With Me\n02.Hunter\n03.Don't Think Of Me\n04.My Lover's Gone\n05.All You Want\n06.Thank You\n07.Honestly Ok\n08.Slide\n09.Isobel\n10.I'm No Angel\n11.My Life\n12.Take My Hand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d0ecfd303527919e5ff9f42ac795a579dcf2a93","amp;dn":"Dido+-+No+Angel+1999++++++CBR320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d0ecfd303527919e5ff9f42ac795a579dcf2a93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,14,207,211,3,82,121,25,229,255,159,66,172,121,90,87,157,207,42,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
