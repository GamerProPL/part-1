Often described\nas Steinbeck's most ambitious novel, East of Eden brings to life the intricate details of two families, the Trasks\nand the Hamiltons, and their interwoven stories. The novel was originally addressed to Steinbeck's young\nsons, Thom and John (then 6Ã‚Â½ and 4Ã‚Â½ years old, respectively). Steinbeck wanted to describe the Salinas\nValley for them in detail: the sights, sounds, smells, and colors.\n\nSummary\nThe story is primarily set in the Salinas Valley, California, between the beginning of the twentieth century\nand the end of World War I, though some chapters are set in Connecticut and Massachusetts, and the story goes\nas far back as the American Civil War.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ca7aa757aca18342e8ce12177dd7978148955d6","amp;dn":"East+Of+Eden+%28John+Steinbeck%29+%5BPDF%2FePub%2Fmobi%5D+HoTTo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ca7aa757aca18342e8ce12177dd7978148955d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,167,170,117,122,202,24,52,46,140,225,33,119,221,121,120,20,137,85,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
