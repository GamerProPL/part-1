Hill giants are stealing all the grain and livestock they can while stone giants have been scouring settlements that have been around forever. Fire giants are press-ganging the smallfolk into the desert, while frost giant longships have been pillaging along the Sword Coast. Even the elusive cloud giants have been witnessed, their wondrous floating cities appearing above Waterdeep and Baldurâ€™s Gate. Where is the storm giant King Hekaton, who is tasked with keeping order among the giants?\r\n\r\nThe humans, dwarves, elves, and other small folk of the Sword Coast will be crushed underfoot from the onslaught of these giant foes. The only chance at survival is for the small folk to work together to investigate this invasion and harness the power of rune magic, the giantsâ€™ weapon against their ancient enemy the dragons. The only way the people of Faerun can restore order is to use the giantsâ€™ own power against them.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCompletely bookmarked and ocr'd for your convenience","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc6833f1a5c42dfee3ae6a7070d02ad268ad4e35","amp;dn":"Storm+King%27s+Thunder.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc6833f1a5c42dfee3ae6a7070d02ad268ad4e35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,104,51,241,165,196,45,254,227,174,106,112,112,208,42,210,104,173,78,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
