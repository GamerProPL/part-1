The Woody Allen Collection, featuring four of his classic short-story books, highlights the comedian's biting wit and signature style Ã¢â‚¬â€œ performed as only he can. These hilarious stories examine the deepest of human questions from the highest heights of absurdity. Allen muses on the relativity of space-time and how it can make a person late for work, the Cosa NostraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s office-supply spending habits, the Frean - a sea monster with the body of a crab and the head of a certified public accountant - and much more.\n\nEverything is fair game, including art, food, crime, sex, death, and dentists. As the New York Times raved, included are &quot;brilliant flights of fancy whose comic detail and inspired silliness are at once dramatic and controlled... by the celebrated stand-up Flaubert.&quot;\n\nThe Collection includes Woody AllenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s four books Without Feathers, Side Effects, Mere Anarchy, and Getting Even, as well as an exclusive interview conducted with the author/narrator, in which he discusses the process, challenges, and rewards or recording his books for the first time.\n\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
