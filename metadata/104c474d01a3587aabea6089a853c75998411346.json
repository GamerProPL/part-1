Keep Fallin \n\nUrban Urban, bluesy, and alive, the album presents ten brand new songs, including the mighty ''Shakespeare'', a tale of young love gone tragically sour as the mood darkens from acoustic to guttural rock; the spiky yet delicate ''Looking Too Closely'', riding an irresistible piano-and-guitar groove; ''Green And The Blue'', on which a vulnerable Greenall meditates on the constants in life that see you through tough tough times; ''Two Days Later'', a deeply personal lament and one of only two songs on the record that start and remain down-tempo; and the breathtaking ''Pilgrim'', the latest collaboration with songwriter Blair Mackichan, co-writer of ''This Is The Thing'' from Fink's 2007 Distance and Time, and ''Honesty'' from 2011's Perfect Darkness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:104c474d01a3587aabea6089a853c75998411346","amp;dn":"Fink+-+Hard+Believer+%282014%29+%5B320+kbps%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"104c474d01a3587aabea6089a853c75998411346","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,76,71,77,1,163,88,122,171,234,96,137,168,83,199,89,152,65,19,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
