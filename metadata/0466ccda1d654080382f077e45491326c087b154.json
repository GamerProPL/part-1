A former child actress turned dance-pop diva, Morissette transformed herself into a confessional alternative singer/songwriter, in the vein of Liz Phair and Tori Amos. However, she added enough pop sensibility, slight hip-hop flourishes, and marketing savvy to that formula to become a superstar with her third album, Jagged Little Pill.\n\nJagged Little Pill - MP3@192kbs 76.1MB\n\nIt&amp;#039;s remarkable that Alanis Morissette&amp;#039;s Jagged Little Pill struck a sympathetic chord with millions of listeners, because it&amp;#039;s so doggedly, determinedly insular. This, after all, plays like an emotional purging, prompted by a bitter relationship -- and, according to all the lyrical hints, that&amp;#039;s likely a record executive who took advantage of a young Alanis. She never disguises her outright rage and disgust, whether it&amp;#039;s the vengeful wrath of &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; or asking him &quot;you scan the credits for your name and wonder why it&amp;#039;s not there.&quot; This is such insider information that it&amp;#039;s hard to believe that millions of listeners not just bought it, but embraced it, turning Alanis Morisette into a mid-&amp;#039;90s phenomenon. Perhaps it was the individuality that made it appealing, since its specificity lent it genuineness -- and, even if this is clearly an attempt to embrace the &quot;women in rock&quot; movement in alterna-rock, Morissette&amp;#039;s intentions are genuine. Often, it seems like Glen Ballard&amp;#039;s pop inclinations fight against Alanis&amp;#039; exorcisms, as her bitter diary entries are given a pop gloss that gives them entry to the pop charts. What&amp;#039;s all the more remarkable is that Alanis isn&amp;#039;t a particularly good singer, stretching the limits of pitch and credibility with her octave-skipping caterwauling. At its core, this is the work of an ambitious but sophomoric 19-year-old, once burned by love, but still willing to open her heart a second time. All of this adds up to a record that&amp;#039;s surprisingly effective, an utterly fascinating exploration of a young woman&amp;#039;s psyche. As slick as the music is, the lyrics are unvarnished and Morissette unflinchingly explores emotions so common, most people would be ashamed to articulate them. This doesn&amp;#039;t make Jagged Little Pill great, but it does make it a fascinating record, a phenomenon that&amp;#039;s intensely personal.\n\n\n1 All I Really Want \t4:44\n2 You Oughta Know \t4:09\n3 Perfect  \t\t3:07\n4 Hand in My Pocket \t3:41\n5 Right Through You \t2:55\n6 Forgiven \t\t5:00\n7 You Learn \t\t3:59\n8 Head over Feet \t4:27\n9 Mary Jane \t\t4:40\n10 Ironic \t\t3:49\n11 Not the Doctor \t3:47\n12 Wake Up \t\t4:53\n13 You Oughta Know [alternate take] 8:12\n\nReleased 1995 on Maverick/Reprise\n\nJagged Little Pill Acoustic - MP3@192kbs 79.4MB\n\n\nThere&amp;#039;s an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm from 2002 where Alanis Morissette is performing at a benefit concert that&amp;#039;s eventually held at Larry David&amp;#039;s home, where she sings a stripped-down acoustic arrangement of &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; with guitarist David Levita for an audience of wealthy Hollywood liberals. This may not have been the genesis of her 2005 album Jagged Little Pill Acoustic -- initially for sale only in Starbucks stores, but released to mass retail in late July -- but that performance not only offers a clue to the sound of this acoustic-based reinterpretation of her blockbuster breakthrough, but also to its target audience. Unlike the 1995 original, this is not a dense, glossy pop album that slyly co-opts and repackages ideas from the musical fringe for a mass audience, nor is this akin to her 1999 acoustic album Alanis Unplugged, where Morissette was still sorting out exactly which direction to take in the aftermath of her phenomenal success. Jagged Little Pill Acoustic is the sound of an artist who is comfortable and settled, fondly reminiscing about her crazy past for an audience that is also comfortable and settled. This is sepia-toned music (which is appropriate, since the cover itself is a sepia-toned replication of the original&amp;#039;s artwork), with all of the excesses and eccentricities of youth either romanticized or dismissed with a soft chuckle. Alanis marvels at how crazy she was back then, as she and her audience both congratulate themselves on surviving ten years while reflecting on how much they&amp;#039;ve personally grown in that decade. All of this is captured in the lone lyrical change: &quot;Ironic&quot; now concludes with Alanis meeting the man of her dreams and meeting not his beautiful wife, but his beautiful husband (she&amp;#039;s no longer pronouncing &quot;figures&quot; as &quot;figgers,&quot; either). This doesn&amp;#039;t change the song or its intent, but it does signal that Morissette has a slightly different perspective, one that is self-congratulatory, more tolerant, and more self-consciously urbane. And that pretty much summarizes the music here, too: it&amp;#039;s deliberately mature and certainly more tasteful than the original Jagged Little Pill, the kind of music that would sound good playing in, well, the background of a coffee shop. While there are acoustic guitars at the foundation of each of the 12 tracks here (plus the unlisted 13th bonus track), this isn&amp;#039;t strictly acoustic, at least by most standards: with original JLP producer Glen Ballard, who never met a production he couldn&amp;#039;t overdub a few more times than necessary, on board as well, it&amp;#039;s not surprising that Acoustic winds up being a subdued adult alternative pop album filled with strings, keyboards, and production instead of a stark acoustic record. Since Ballard is a pro and since Alanis has lived with these songs long enough to find different, yet comfortable, ways to rephrase these familiar melodies, it&amp;#039;s a pleasant enough listen, but it&amp;#039;s hard to see the point of the album. That is, unless it is really for the kind of crowd she serenaded in that episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm -- a very satisfied, very comfortable audience that prefers to see the past only through rose-colored glasses that present their history in terms that are more acceptable to who they are now than who they were back then.\n\n1 \tAll I Really Want \t5:24\n2 \tYou Oughta Know \t4:58\n3 \tPerfect \t\t3:26\n4 \tHand in My Pocket \t4:32\n5 \tRight Through You \t3:40\n6 \tForgiven \t\t4:43\n7 \tYou Learn \t\t4:10\n8 \tHead Over Feet \t\t4:17\n9 \tMary Jane \t\t5:08\n10 \tIronic \t\t\t3:57\n11 \tNot the Doctor \t\t4:26\n12 \tWake Up \t\t9:56\n\nReleased 2005 on Maverick\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0466ccda1d654080382f077e45491326c087b154","amp;dn":"Alanis+Morrisette+-+Jagged+Little+Pill+%26+Jagged+Little+Pill+Acou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0466ccda1d654080382f077e45491326c087b154","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,102,204,218,29,101,64,128,56,47,7,126,69,73,19,38,192,135,177,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
