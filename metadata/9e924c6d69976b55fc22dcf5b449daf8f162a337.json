Effectively solves the communication problems between the Mac system and NTFS, providing full read and write access to Windows NTFS partitions under OS X. Excellent solution for end users, SOHO, and enterprise, supports all NTFS versions from Windows NT 3.1 to Windows 8 (NTFS versions 1.2, 3.0 and 3.1), and mounts the NTFS volumes as native ones.\r\n\r\nFeatures:-\r\n\r\nNTFS for OS X allows you to:\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Works with Mac OS X El Capitan!\r\nâ€¢ Free of charge and no registration needed\r\nâ€¢ Unprecedented high level of performance\r\nâ€¢ Advanced support of the HFS+ and NTFS file system features\r\nâ€¢ Free update for those who bought NTFS for Mac 12\r\n\r\nThe latest OS X El Capitan has been updated with the System Integrity Protection (SIP) feature. This new security policy prevents modifications to certain system files, folders and processes. This protects components on disk and at run-time, only allowing system binaries to be modified by the system installer and software updates.\r\n\r\nSystem Integrity Protection introduction made the algorythms, which NTFS for MacÂ® driver previously run, absolutely non-functional. Moreover all cross-platform solutions for OS X Yosemite will no longer work with OS X 10.11 El Capitan without additional fixes. To keep users happy and make this considerable security upgrade smooth and invisible, we have specifically updated Paragonâ€™s best-selling NTFS driver for OS X El Capitan.\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS:-\r\n\r\nâ€¢ OS X 10.5 or later","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e924c6d69976b55fc22dcf5b449daf8f162a337","amp;dn":"Paragon+NTFS+v14.0.332+Mac+OS+X+%7BB4tman%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e924c6d69976b55fc22dcf5b449daf8f162a337","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,146,76,109,105,151,107,85,252,34,220,245,180,73,218,248,241,98,163,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
