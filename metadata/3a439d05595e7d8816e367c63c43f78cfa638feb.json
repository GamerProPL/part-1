That source turned out to be the twenty-nine-year-old NSA contractor Edward Snowden, and his revelations about the agency's widespread, systemic overreach proved to be some of the most explosive and consequential news in recent history, triggering a fierce debate over national security and information privacy.\r\nNow Greenwald fits all the pieces together, recounting his high-intensity eleven-day trip to Hong Kong, examining the broader implications of the surveillance detailed in his reporting for The Guardian, and revealing fresh information on the NSA's unprecedented abuse of power with documents from the Snowden archive. Fearless and incisive, No Place to Hide has already sparked outrage around the globe and been hailed by voices across the political spectrum as an essential contribution to our understanding of the U.S. surveillance state","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a439d05595e7d8816e367c63c43f78cfa638feb","amp;dn":"Glenn+Greenwald+-+No+Place+to+Hide+-+Edward+Snowden%2C+the+NSA%2C+an","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a439d05595e7d8816e367c63c43f78cfa638feb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,67,157,5,89,94,125,136,22,227,103,198,60,67,247,140,250,99,143,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
