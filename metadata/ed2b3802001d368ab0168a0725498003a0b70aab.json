You'll be able to expand\nyour city outward and upward with enormous, multizone MegaTowers. As your\ncity's population grows, your choices will influence whether your Sims abide\nside by side in peace and harmony or whether they bristle with barely subdued\ntension. Perform extensive research and discover technologies that will make\nyour city less polluted and reliant on finite resources or enjoy high-tech\nluxuries, such as futurized vehicles, service drones and Mag Levs that rise\nabove the streets and small buildings - but beware of giant robot attacks,\nwhich may occur as a result of scientific infusion into society. Decide which\nsegments of your city's populace - good or bad - will be sent on an adventure\nto the stars as space tourists with Launch Arcology. Gaze in awe as your\ncivilians launch off into the unknown in a spectacular display of stellar\nproportions. What will the future of your city look like?\n\nInstall Notes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n1. Extract RARs\n2. Copy files to install folder\n3. Run the game as administrator\n4. Have fun!\n\nSimCity-Razor1911 must be installed.\nThe game requires Microsoft Visual C++ runtimes. Install them before playing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed2b3802001d368ab0168a0725498003a0b70aab","amp;dn":"SimCity+Cities+Of+Tomorrow+Expansion+Pack-RazorDOX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed2b3802001d368ab0168a0725498003a0b70aab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,43,56,2,0,29,54,138,176,22,138,7,37,73,128,3,160,183,10,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
