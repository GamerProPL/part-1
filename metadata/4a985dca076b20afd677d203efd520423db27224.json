It was created and executive produced by Humanitas Prize and Emmy Award-winner Chris Nee and premiered on March 23, 2012. The series chronicles a six-year-old girl named Dottie McStuffins who, one day, wants to become a doctor like her mother. As a kid, she &quot;pretends&quot; to be a doctor by fixing up toys and dolls (because of this, everyone calls her 'Doc'). When she puts on her stethoscope, toys, dolls, and stuffed animals magically come to life and she can communicate with them. With a little help from her stuffed animal friends, Stuffy, Hallie, Lambie and Chilly, Doc helps toys &quot;feel better&quot; by giving them check-ups and checking their illnesses with &quot;The Big Book of Boo Boos&quot;. Each 11-minute episode includes original songs, the &quot;Time for Your Check-Up&quot; song and the &quot;I Feel Better&quot; song.\n\nAfter your download completes, please stick around to seed so that others may enjoy. I'm still recording new episodes as they air, if people continue to seed I will continue to post more episodes.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a985dca076b20afd677d203efd520423db27224","amp;dn":"Doc+McStuffins+Season+1%2C+Episodes+13-26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a985dca076b20afd677d203efd520423db27224","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,152,93,202,7,107,32,175,214,119,210,3,239,213,32,66,61,178,114,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
