Let England Shake was recorded in a 19th Century church in Dorset, on a cliff-top overlooking the sea. It was created with a cast of musicians including such long-standing allies as Flood, John Parish, and Mick Harvey. What is remarkable about Let England Shake is bound up with its music, its abiding atmosphere and in particular, its words. If Harvey's past work might seem to draw of direct emotional experience, this album is rather different. Its songs centre on both her home country, and events further afield in which it has embroiled itself.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:939103764c3d221bff073330890f9ea233f81909","amp;dn":"PJ+Harvey+-+Let+England+Shake+%5Bmp3-256-2011%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"939103764c3d221bff073330890f9ea233f81909","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,145,3,118,76,61,34,27,255,7,51,48,137,15,158,162,51,248,25,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
