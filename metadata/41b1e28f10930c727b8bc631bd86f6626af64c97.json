It is loosely autobiographical, blending childhood memories, newsreel footage and poems by his father Arseny Tarkovsky. The film features Margarita Terekhova, Ignat Daniltsev, Tarkovsky's wife Larisa Tarkovskaya, Alla Demidova and Anatoli Solonitsyn and has a soundtrack by Eduard Artemyev.\n\nThe Mirror has no apparent plot. Instead it rhythmically combines contemporary scenes with childhood memories and newsreel footage. At various points in the film poems by Tarkovsky's father are recited. The loose flow of visually oneiric images has been compared to the stream of consciousness technique in literature. Its complex yet simultaneously simple structure makes The Mirror one of Tarkovsky's most difficult films, as well as his most personal. Today The Mirror is widely regarded as a masterpiece and one of Tarkovsky's best works.[3]\n\nThe concept of The Mirror dates as far back as 1964. Over the years Tarkovsky wrote several screenplay variants, at time working together with Aleksandr Misharin. This script was initially not approved by the film committee of Goskino, and only after several years of waiting Tarkovsky would be allowed to realize The Mirror. At various times the script was known under different names, most notably Confession and A White, White Day. The completed film was initially rejected by Goskino, and after some delay only given a limited release in the Soviet Union.\n\n\n=============\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.46 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 41mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 057 Kbps\nWriting application              : VirtualDubModRus 1.5.10.2 (build 2542/release)\nWriting library                  : VirtualDubMod build 2542/release\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode                      : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                         : DX50\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 5\nDuration                         : 1h 41mn\nBit rate                         : 1 600 Kbps\nWidth                            : 704 pixels\nHeight                           : 528 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.172\nStream size                      : 1.14 GiB (78%)\nWriting library                  : DivX 6.8.3-6.8.4 (UTC 2008-06-07)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nCodec ID                         : 2000\nDuration                         : 1h 41mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 326 MiB (22%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 512 ms\n\n==============\n\nNOTE: The movie contains its original mono audio.
