Both guitarist Vogg and bassist Martin also held down membership of Black Metal act LUX OCCULTA .\n\nIn 1997 the trio of vocalist Sauron, guitarist Vogg and Vitek added the 13 year old bassist Martin. DECAPITATED, hailing from Krosno, debuted with the demos Cemeteral Gardens in 1997 and 1998 &quot;The Eye Of Horus&quot;. Further exposure was garnered by the inclusion of tracks on the 2000 Relapse Records 'Polish Assault' compilation alongside YATTERING , LOST SOUL and DAMNABLE . The first album, recorded for Earache subsidiary Wicked World, was produced by VADER Piotr Wiwczarek and sees a cover of SLAYER Mandatory Suicide. DECAPITATED early demos were pressed up onto CD by PolandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Metal Mind Productions entitled The First Damned, adding two live tracks from the 'Thrash 'em All' festival. The band toured as support to VADER in early 2001.\n\nDECAPITATED's February 2002 album 'Nihility' would include a cover version of NAPALM DEATH 's 'Suffer The Children'. The band scored a valuable coup later that same year, being chosen to perform at the Polish 'Ozzfest' event in late May. By August DECAPITATED was on the road in North America with tour partners INCANTATION , VEHEMENCE and DEAD TO FALL . The band, shooting a promotional video for the track 'Spheres of Madness' to further promote the album, would form up part of a strong package bill topped by VADER for a run of dates across mainland Europe from late August alongside KRISIUN and PREJUDICE . Vitek took time out to lay down drums on VADER frontman Piotr Wiwczarek's PANZER X project EP 'Steel Fist'. The February 2004 DECAPITATED album 'The Negatron' would see a bonus track offering of a take on DEICIDE 's 'Lunatic Of God's Creation'.\n\nA short spurt of UK dates saw the band ranked alongside ROTTING CHRIST , ANATA and THUS DEFILED . The band then united with Norwegian Black Metal elite outfit MAYHEM and Japanese act DEFILED for a European tour commencing early April. US dates scheduled for July and August had DECAPITATED opening for CANNIBAL CORPSE . However, all North American touring plans were cancelled due to the sensitivity in regard to the band's name and the executions of hostage victims in Iraq. DECAPITATED parted ways with guitarist Jacek Hiro in October, opting to remain a quartet for February 2005 European gigs allied with HATE , CRIONICS and DIES IRAE . The band re-shaped in June when frontman Sauron closed a nine year tenure by announcing his withdrawal. DECAPITATED quickly drew in their friend Covan formerly of ATROPHIA RED SUN, NEUROTOXIC.c.w.a., as replacement.\n\nThe band entered Hertz Studios in Bialystok in August to record a new album entitled 'Organic Hallucinosis'. September European dates had DECAPITATED partnered with British act GOREROTTED and Dutch DETONATION . Following US gigs in December, DECAPITATED parted ways with bassist Martin, the four-stringer having to deal with military conscription issues, pulling in Richard Gulczynski as replacement. Live work breaking into 2006, promoting the 'Organic Hallucinosis' album recorded at Hertz Studio in Bialystok, saw the band teaming up with HYPOCRISY , SOILENT GREEN , RAGING SPEEDHORN , NILE and WITH PASSION for a North American tour commencing in early January. In mid February it was learned that bassist Martin had returned to the fold.\n\nUS dates for September and October 2006 saw the band hooking up with KRISIUN , CATTLE DECAPITATION , SIX FEET UNDER and ABYSMAL DAWN . The band united with headliners FEAR FACTORY and SUFFOCATION for further North American shows in November. The band united with Nancy's PHAZM for extensive European touring throughout February 2007. In May the group toured throughout Australia and New Zeeland supporting NILE . The band's next tour outing was to be the 'Summer Slaughter' trek across the USA throughout June and July, seeing NECROPHAGIST headlining on a mammoth package billing with BENEATH THE MASSACRE , CEPHALIC CARNAGE , CATTLE DECAPITATION , THE FACELESS , AS BLOOD RUNS BLACK , ARSIS and ION DISSONANCE .
