King\nIcon 2 (2011)\n\n\n\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nUniversally hailed as the reigning king of the blues, the legendary B.B. King is without a doubt the single most important electric guitarist of the last half century. His bent notes and staccato picking style have influenced legions of contemporary bluesmen, while his gritty and confident voice -- capable of wringing every nuance from any lyric -- provides a worthy match for his passionate playing. Between 1951 and 1985, King notched an impressive 74 entries on Billboard's R&amp;B charts, and he was one of the few full-fledged blues artists to score a major pop hit when his 1970 smash &quot;The Thrill Is Gone&quot; crossed over to mainstream success (engendering memorable appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show and American Bandstand). Since that time, he has partnered with such musicians as Eric Clapton and U2 while managing his own acclaimed solo career, all the while maintaining his immediately recognizable style on the electric guitar. \n\n\nGenre................: Blues\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Geffen\nIncluded.............: Covers, Log, Cue\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.How Blue Can You Get\n02.Help The Poor\n03.Every Day I Have The Blues (Live)\n04.Sweet Little Angel (Live)\n05.All Over Again\n06.Don't Answer The Door\n07.Paying The Cost To Be The Boss\n08.Why I Sing The Blues\n09.The Thrill Is Gone\n10.Nobody Loves Me But My Mother\n11.Hummingbird\n12.Chains And Things\n\nCD2\n\n01.Ain't Nobody Home\n02.Ghetto Woman\n03.Guess Who\n04.To Know You Is To Love You\n05.I Like To Live The Love\n06.Let The Good Times Roll (Live Duet With Bobby Bland)\n07.Never Make A Move Too Soon\n08.Better Not Look Down\n09.There Must Be A Better World Somewhere\n10.When Love Comes To Town (Live)\n11.Playin' With My Friends (Duet With Robert Cray)\n12.I'll Survive\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b99a27ca6cdbaf0f34eb290ff2bc6bd13728334","amp;dn":"B.B.+King+-+Icon+2+%282011%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b99a27ca6cdbaf0f34eb290ff2bc6bd13728334","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,153,162,124,166,205,186,240,243,78,178,144,255,43,198,189,19,114,131,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
