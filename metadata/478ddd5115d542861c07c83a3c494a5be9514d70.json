A pair of aliens, angered by the &quot;stupid minds&quot; of planet Earth, set up shop in a California cemetery. Their plan: to animate an army of the dead to march on the capitals of the world. (The fact that they have only managed to resurrect three zombies to date has not discouraged them.) An intrepid airline pilot living near the cemetery must rescue his wife from this low-budget terror. &quot;Can you prove it *didn't* happen?&quot;\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 640x480\nAudio: AAC 48000Hz mono 82Kbps\nRunning time: 1:18:21","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:478ddd5115d542861c07c83a3c494a5be9514d70","amp;dn":"Plan+9+from+Outer+Space+%281959%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"478ddd5115d542861c07c83a3c494a5be9514d70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,141,221,81,21,213,66,134,28,7,200,58,60,73,74,91,233,81,77,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
