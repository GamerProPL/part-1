They were understandably nervous about \r\nhis reappearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed like a good \r\nidea. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, \r\nhedonistic metropolis of Vice City. He's set up and is left with no money \r\nand no merchandise. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker gangs, Cuban \r\ngangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. Most if not all of \r\nVice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and \r\ntake over the city himself.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Developer......................: Rockstar North.\r\n=&gt;-Publisher......................: Rockstar Games.\r\n=&gt;-Platform.......................: Microsoft Windows.\r\n=&gt;-Release date...................: 27 October 2002.\r\n=&gt;-Genre..........................: Action-adventure Open World.\r\n=&gt;-Mode...........................: Single player.\r\n=&gt;-Media..........................: 2 X CD.\r\n\r\nSystem Specifications.\r\n=&gt;-Minimum system requirements :..: Recommended system requirements.\r\n=&gt;-CPU 800 MHz :..................: CPU 1.2GHz CPU.\r\n=&gt;-Memory 128 MB RAM :............: Memory 256 MB RAM.\r\n=&gt;-GPU 32 MB DX3D Graphics :......: GPU 64 MB DX3D Graphics.\r\n=&gt;-Direct X 8.1 :.................: Direct X 8.1\r\n=&gt;-OS Win98/ME/2K/XP/wIN7/WIN10 :.: OS Win98/ME/2K/XP/wIN7/WIN10.\r\n=&gt;-HDD Space 915MB :..............: HDD Space 1.55GB.\r\n=&gt;-Sound DX 9 sound card :........: Sound DX 9 With Surround Sound.\r\n\r\nMedia Files.\r\n=&gt;-GTA_Vice_City_Install.iso.\r\n=&gt;-GTA_Vice_City_Play.iso.\r\n\r\nQuick Install Instructions.\r\n=&gt;-Mount or insert GTA_Vice_City_Install.iso run setup.\r\n=&gt;-When asked mount or insert GTA_Vice_City_Play.iso and OK.\r\n=&gt;-Apply ViceCity_Patch_11.exe.\r\n=&gt;-Replace Games gta-vc.exe with one provided","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c227a62716f71362e394ee0eb43629df4eb24ab","amp;dn":"Grand+Theft+Auto+Vice+City+-+Action+Adventure+2002","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c227a62716f71362e394ee0eb43629df4eb24ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,34,122,98,113,111,113,54,46,57,78,224,235,67,98,157,244,235,36,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
