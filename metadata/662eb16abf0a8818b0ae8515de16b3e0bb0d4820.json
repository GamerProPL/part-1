The mysterious stranger insinuates himself into the home of a wealthy Italian family, where he exerts a curious, sensual spirituality over everyone in the household. He then proceeds to seduce everyone in the family (male and female) including the maid, which gives each person some sort of unique epiphany. Because he reveals so little about his innermost thoughts, &quot;The Visitor&quot; becomes all things to all people. What it boils down to is this: Is the enigmatic visitor Christ, or is he the Devil? Matching Terence Stamp's multi-textured performance every step of the way is Laura Betti as the family's maid; Betti, in fact, won the &quot;Best Actress Award&quot; at the 1968 Venice Film Festival. Director Pasolini adapted the screenplay of Teorema from his own novel.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063678/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063678/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-4060&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-4060&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:34:10\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x328 2.20:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1807 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,31 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : ATSC/A-52 Dolby AC3\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:662eb16abf0a8818b0ae8515de16b3e0bb0d4820","amp;dn":"Teorema+%281968%29+Pier+Paolo+Pasolini++It+%28Engsubs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"662eb16abf0a8818b0ae8515de16b3e0bb0d4820","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,46,177,106,191,10,136,24,176,174,133,21,222,22,179,224,187,13,72,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
