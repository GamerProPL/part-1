We also offer a variety of web-only content, including blogs, debates and audio/video programmes.\r\nOur organisation\r\n\r\nThe Economist online is part of The Economist Group and is responsible for The Economist on the internet. We have offices in New York, London and San Francisco, and a growing worldwide editorial staff.\r\n\r\nIt is not only The Economist's name that people find baffling. Here are some other common questions.\r\n\r\nFirst, why does it call itself a newspaper? Even when The Economist incorporated the Bankers' Gazette and Railway Monitor from 1845 to 1932, it also described itself as &quot;a political, literary and general newspaper&quot;.\r\n\r\nIt still does so because, in addition to offering analysis and opinion, it tries in each issue to cover the main eventsâ€”business and politicalâ€”of the week. It goes to press on Thursdays and, printed simultaneously in six countries, is available in most of the world's main cities the following day or soon after.\r\n\r\nReaders everywhere get the same editorial matter. The advertisements differ. The running order of the sections, and sometimes the cover, also differ. But the words are the same, except that each week readers in Britain get a few extra pages devoted to British news.\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/shtihl22\r\n\r\n=======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0450fcd6e7aad0a20c41e655f71f085124f9e9b4","amp;dn":"The+Economist+USA+-+Volume+420+Number+9003+-+August+20-26%2C+2016+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0450fcd6e7aad0a20c41e655f71f085124f9e9b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,80,252,214,231,170,208,162,12,65,230,85,247,31,8,81,36,249,233,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
