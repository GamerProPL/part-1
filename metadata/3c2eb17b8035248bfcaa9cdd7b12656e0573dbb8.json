The Vegas Pro 12 interface provides an impressive array innovative tools and thoughtful touches, with a fully customizable workspace for accomplishing a wide range of production tasks. Nest Vegas Pro projects within the timeline, customize and save keyboard commands, and use application scripting to automate repetitive tasks. The new Expanded Edit Mode temporarily splits the track at the edit point and enables you to dynamically add or remove frames from either side of the edit point while the media is playing, creating a highly precise, interactive editing experience\n\nPowerful effect and compositing engine\nCombine up to 32 high-quality, keyframeable effects per Effects Chain and apply them at the Event, Track, Media, or Project level. Vegas Pro 12 uses an advanced plug-in architecture based on the OpenFX standard, for hundreds of optional effects from leading visual effects plug-in VFX developers.

Expanded edit mode\nDouble click at the edit point to see the timeline in a detailed &quot;A-B Roll&quot; view. The adjacent frames of the events at the edit point can be clearly viewed above the tracks for reference, and unused media in the events can be seen in the track area. The edit point/event edge is highlighted in red, and can be trimmed with the mouse or numeric keypad. Setting a Loop Region around the edit point enables you to dynamically add or remove frames from either side of the edit point while the media is playing, creating a highly precise, interactive editing experience.\n\nNew! Project interchange\nImport and export a wide range of project files to and from Vegas Pro 12. The built-in software can convert between the native .veg file and AAF for AvidÃ‚Â® ProToolsÃ‚Â® 10, XML for AppleÃ‚Â® Final Cut ProÃ‚Â® 7, Final Cut Pro X (export only), DaVinci Resolve 8, and .prproj for AdobeÃ‚Â® PremiereÃ‚Â® Pro CS6 and After EffectsÃ‚Â® CS6.\n\nNew! User interface enhancements\nMultiple UI updates will help new users become familiar with Vegas Pro 12, as well as improving the editing experience for current Vegas Pro users. Included in the Enhancements: (1) A new Toolbar Icon for Splitting, (2) A yellow border outlines the most recently added clip on the timeline, (3) Large blue handles on timeline events make it easier to grab the various interactive event modifiers, and (4) more comprehensive tool tips, describing not just the name of the tool but also what the tool does.\n\nNew!

The Event FX, Generated Media, and Pan-Crop icons on timeline events have been relocated to the bottom edge, to avoid accidentally clicking on them while edge-trimming the event. A Trim Start-End mode quickly trims the beginning or end of an event based on the cursor position.

Edge handles now use contrasting colors to make selection more noticeable, and improved outlining is used to make Event Selection, Grouping, and Sync Link groups more apparent.\n\nMulti-format native editing\nVegas Pro 12 improves on its ground-breaking &quot;no transcode, no re-wrap&quot; heritage by adding native format support for Panasonic P2 AVC-Intra and DVCPRO source material.
