In Ã¢â‚¬Å“Home,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a combat-damaged soldier moves back in with his mother and struggles to reconcile the world he left with the one to which he has returned. And in the title story, a stunning meditation on imagination, memory, and loss, a middle-aged cancer patient walks into the woods to commit suicide, only to encounter a troubled young boy who, over the course of a fateful morning, gives the dying man a final chance to recall who he really is. A hapless, deluded owner of an antiques store; two mothers struggling to do the right thing; a teenage girl whose idealism is challenged by a brutal brush with reality; a man tormented by a series of pharmaceutical experiments that force him to lust, to love, to killÃ¢â‚¬â€the unforgettable characters that populate the pages of Tenth of December are vividly and lovingly infused with SaundersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signature blend of exuberant prose, deep humanity, and stylistic innovation.\n \nWriting brilliantly and profoundly about class, sex, love, loss, work, despair, and war, Saunders cuts to the core of the contemporary experience. These stories take on the big questions and explore the fault lines of our own morality, delving into the questions of what makes us good and what makes us human.\n \nUnsettling, insightful, and hilarious, the stories in Tenth of DecemberÃ¢â‚¬â€through their manic energy, their focus on what is redeemable in human beings, and their generosity of spiritÃ¢â‚¬â€not only entertain and delight; they fulfill ChekhovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dictum that art should Ã¢â‚¬Å“prepare us for tenderness.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea5e9c60f499b80938877fca19707a7c0a3e2bda","amp;dn":"Tenth+of+December%3A+Stories+%28ePUB%29+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea5e9c60f499b80938877fca19707a7c0a3e2bda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,94,156,96,244,153,184,9,56,135,127,202,25,112,122,124,10,62,43,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
