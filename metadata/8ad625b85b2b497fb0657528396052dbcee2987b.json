CloneCD's award-winning user interface allows you to copy almost any CD in just a few mouse clicks.\n\nSince the release of 5.0, CloneCD is not only able to copy CDs but also most DVD formats, such as DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD+R Dual Layer and DVD-RAM. The movies are copied 1:1 and therefore not modified (compressed).
