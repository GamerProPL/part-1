I was annoyed that it was virtually impossible for me to find these Jam Packs on any The Pirate Bay, let alone any other Torrent site, so once I was able to track them all down, I figured I would clean them up a bit and upload them in a much more convenient way.\n\nI have converted all of the .toast files to .dmg, for those of you who don't have Toast (Which I don't really understand...just pirate it!).  I have tested and installed them myself, and they all work.\n\n---\n\n\n\nGarageBand Jam Packs\n--------------------\n\nOpen a Jam Pack and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find all the talent you need ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ hundreds of professional backup musicians and sound engineers at your disposal 24/7. Each Jam Pack offers thousands of Apple Loops and dozens of playable software instruments.\n\n\nVoices\n------\n\nWhether your song needs a soloist, backup singers, or an entire choir, the talent is on call. Voices gives you over 1500 Apple Loops featuring professional soloists and choirs in multiple genres and styles. It also offers over 20 software instruments, including voices, choral ensembles, and amazing drum kits built on the human voice and body.\n\nRhythm Section\n--------------\n\nIf youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re looking for a backing band, Rhythm Section provides a veritable drum construction kit. Assemble a solid foundation of drums with varied sets of fills, grooves, and groove variations. Thanks to the wide variety of drum sounds available, you can create human-sounding performances. Rhythm Section also provides dozens of playable instruments: ten strings, ten basses, and ten drum kits.\n\nWorld Music\n-----------\n\nLet your musical wanderings take you to more exotic places with World Music. Recorded over the course of a worldwide expedition and featuring an unprecedented collection of world loops, ethnic percussion, exotic strings, and regional wood instruments, World Music captures the most authentic performances in dozens of countries, genres, and playing styles.\n\nRemix Tools\n-----------\n\nGotta groove? This Jam Pack is for you. Designed for electronic dance music enthusiasts who like to move to hip-hop, techno, trance, and R&amp;B, Remix Tools offers beat kits, sound effects, synth sounds, and the rhythms of classic Roland drum machines.\n\nSymphony Orchestra\n------------------\n\nSymphony Orchestra lets you conduct a full orchestra, from brass and percussion to strings and woodwinds. Create classical compositions or soundtracks, or add the power of a symphony to your GarageBand pop, rock, and hip-hop songs.\n\n---\n\n\nNote:  On a couple of the .dmg files, when you extract it, you will get a warning at the &quot;Verification&quot; stage of unpacking.  If you just click &quot;Open,&quot; it will still work.  I don't really know why that message pops up, in all honesty.  There is nothing wrong with these Jam Packs.\n\n\nI hope you all enjoy!  Leave some comments for others once you figure out they are real.  I will keep this Torrent alive as long as humanly possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad6f74df64c50880673ee2ef06d9e8c3bfeb921a","amp;dn":"Apple+GarageBand+Jam+Packs+%28All%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad6f74df64c50880673ee2ef06d9e8c3bfeb921a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,111,116,223,100,197,8,128,103,62,226,239,6,217,232,195,191,235,146,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
