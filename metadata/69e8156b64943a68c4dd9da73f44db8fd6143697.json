Based on a combined 70+ years of academic expertise, elite-level coaching experience, and the observation of thousands of novice trainees, the authors present a chronological analysis of the response to exercise as it varies through the training history of the athlete, one that reflects the realities of human physiology, psychology, and common sense. Practical Programming explains the differences in response to exercise commonly observed between athletes at the novice, intermediate, and advanced levels, explains these differences in the context of the relevant science, and presents new training models that actually work for athletes at all levels of experience. Complete with new, innovative graphical representation of cutting edge concepts in exercise programming, Practical Programming has become a standard reference in the field of exercise and human performance.\n\nAuthors: Rippetoe and Kilgore\nPublisher: The Aasgaard Company\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0982522703\nISBN-13: 978-0982522707","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69e8156b64943a68c4dd9da73f44db8fd6143697","amp;dn":"Practical+Programming+For+Strength+Training.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69e8156b64943a68c4dd9da73f44db8fd6143697","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,232,21,107,100,148,58,104,196,221,157,167,63,68,219,143,214,20,54,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
