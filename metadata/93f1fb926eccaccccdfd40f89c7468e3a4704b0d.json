The band consists of Erlend ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œye and Eirik Glambek BÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸e. They met as children at a geography competition. They are known for their delicate tunes, calming voices, and intricately subtle guitar melodies.\nErlend currently lives in Berlin and Eirik in Bergen.\n\nAfter first earning notice thanks to a series of acclaimed European festival appearances during the summer of 1999, the twosome signed to American label Kindercore to issue their lovely eponymous debut the following spring. Quiet Is the New Loud was issued in early 2001 on Astralwerks. The album used many of the same tracks from the Kindercore release but re-ordered them and replaced a few with newer songs. The remix album Versus followed later in the year and featured remixes by artists as diverse as Ladytron, avid Whitaker and Four Tet. After a three year layoff during which ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œye recorded a solo album, 2003ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s Unrest, and gained some reknown as an electronica DJ while BÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸e worked on finishing up his psychology degree, the pair teamed up again for the recording and release of 2004ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s excellent Riot on an Empty Street.\n\nErlend ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œye has released some solo material and is also a member of The Whitest Boy Alive.\nEirik Glambek BÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸e is also a member of a second band, Kommode.
