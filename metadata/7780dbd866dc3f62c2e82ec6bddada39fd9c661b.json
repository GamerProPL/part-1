Tro, &quot;Chemistry: A Molecular Approach (4th Edition)&quot;\r\nEnglish | ISBN: 0134112830 | 2017 | 1315 pages | True PDF | 136 MB\r\n\r\nFor courses in Chemistry.\r\n\r\nBuilding 21st Century Data Analysis and Problem-Solving Skills in Modern Chemistry\r\nThe Fourth Edition of Niva TroÃ¢Â€â„¢s Chemistry: A Molecular Approach reinforces development of 21st century skills including data interpretation and analysis, problem solving and quantitative reasoning, applying conceptual understanding to new situations and peer-to-peer collaboration.\r\n\r\nNivaldo Tro presents chemistry visually through multi-level imagesâ€“macroscopic, molecular, and symbolic representationsâ€“helping readers see the connections between the world they see around them (macroscopic), the atoms and molecules that compose the world (molecular), and the formulas they write down on paper (symbolic). The benefits of Dr. TroÃ¢Â€â„¢s problem-solving approach are reinforced through digital, Interactive Worked Examples that provide an office-hour type of environment and expanded coverage on the latest developments in chemistry. New Key Concept Videos explain difficult concepts while new end-of-chapter problems including Group Work questions and Data Interpretation and Analysis questions engage readers in applying their understanding of chemistry. The revision has been constructed to easily incorporate material to engage readers.\r\n\r\nAlso available with MasteringChemistry\r\nMasteringChemistry from Pearson is the leading online homework, tutorial, and assessment system, designed to improve results by engaging you before, during, and after class with powerful content. Instructors ensure you arrive ready to learn by assigning educationally effective content before class, and encourage critical thinking and retention with in-class resources such as Learning Catalyticsâ„¢. You can further master concepts after class through traditional and adaptive homework assignments that provide hints and answer-specific feedback. The Mastering gradebook records scores for all automatically graded assignments in one place, while diagnostic tools give instructors access to rich data to assess your understanding and misconceptions.\r\n\r\nMastering brings learning full circle by continuously adapting to your learning and making learning more personal than everâ€“before, during, and after class","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7780dbd866dc3f62c2e82ec6bddada39fd9c661b","amp;dn":"Chemistry%3A+A+Molecular+Approach+%284th+Edition%29+by+Nivaldo+J.+Tro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7780dbd866dc3f62c2e82ec6bddada39fd9c661b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,128,219,216,102,220,63,98,194,232,46,198,189,218,218,57,253,156,102,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
