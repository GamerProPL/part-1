Between the first two rounds of the election, Mayor of Dunkirk Philippe Rickwaert, the friend and personal advisor to the Socialist candidate Francis Laugier, is warned there will be a financial investigation in a social housing office in Dunkirk which he misused to finance the campaign...\r\n\r\n2/8. While the elections take place, Rickwaert figures out Laugier's new strategy - he has sent his special advisor, Dorendeu, to help a Green candidate to hinder the far-right candidate's chances of retaining its Northern constituency.\r\n\r\n3/8. Having become increasingly ill, the first secretary of the Socialist Party steps down, triggering a vicious battle over succession to the post. As conflict ensues between Rickwaert and Laugier, Dorendeu finds herself in the middle of it all.\r\n\r\n4/8. While Laugier launches education reforms, Rickwaert decides he can use a student movement against him. In Rickwaert's opinion, pulling the strings behind a demonstration for young people will pave the perfect path for him to return to the heart of politics.\r\n\r\n5/8. Rickwaert tries everything he can to charm and get in with the leaders of the opposition. He negotiates with the former right-wing President to support the student demonstrations, causing shockwaves to flow through the political community.\r\n\r\n6/8. Rickwaert leads a ruthless battle to maintain his position in Dunkirk and seems to be back on Laugier's side. Laugier stands up to the Germans over EU sanctions on the excessive deficit.\r\n\r\n7/8. While the cards look favourable for France in the European Tug of war, the OHL Dunkirk affair resurfaces, forcing Laugier and Rickwaert to navigate troubled waters between diplomacy and foul play.\r\n\r\n8/8. After an incriminating court document is released and the media get hold of it, Rickwaert will risk anything to save his own back...\r\n\r\nVideo 852 x 418 / 29.97 fps / 1000 (approx) kbps / Mp4\r\n\r\nAudio 128 kbps AAC\r\n\r\nDuration 0:50 (approx)\r\n\r\nSeed to the Max - Merci beaucoup . . .\r\n\r\nSno\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt4835480\r\n\r\nBaron Noir, Thriller, Drama, Politics, France, Hardcoded, Sno\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI seed all of my torrents to a ratio of 150:1 - please help seed to keep them alive\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRipped / Encoded / Uploaded by Snowhiter\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAny Bitcoin Donations Welcome here : 164BRZMwZZHmBHS7WLU2s4ZB3geRZZuV3b","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6297161907189937a0f54bf20383c3be42313a45","amp;dn":"Baron+Noir+S01+-+Hardcoded+Eng+Subs+-+Sno","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6297161907189937a0f54bf20383c3be42313a45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,151,22,25,7,24,153,55,160,245,75,242,3,131,195,190,66,49,58,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
