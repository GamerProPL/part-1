At the age of twenty-two she became private secretary to Adolf Hitler and served him for two and a half years, right up to the bitter end.\r\n\r\nJunge observed the intimate workings of Hitlerâ€™s administration, she typed correspondence and speeches, including Hitlerâ€™s public and private last will and testament; she ate her meals and spent evenings with him; and she was close enough to hear the bomb that was intended to assassinate Hitler in the Wolfâ€™s Lair, close enough to smell the bitter almond odor of Eva Braunâ€™s cyanide pill. In her intimate, detailed memoir, Junge invites readers to experience day-to-day life with the most horrible dictator of the twentieth century","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50f9bee5fa63c43f182ad54b71160154c0cd3968","amp;dn":"Hitler%27s+Last+Secretary%3A+A+Firsthand+Account+of+Life+with+Hitler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50f9bee5fa63c43f182ad54b71160154c0cd3968","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,249,190,229,250,99,196,63,24,42,213,75,113,22,1,84,192,205,57,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
