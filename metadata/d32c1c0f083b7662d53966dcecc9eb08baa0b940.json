On a windows machine or in a VM or Crossover (it's on the site too), run the included keygen.\n\n2. It will give you a License ID (That's the string that looks like Lxxxx-xxx), and when you run Mathematica for the first time, it will give you a MathID, a long sequence of characters. Input that in to the keygen and press generate, which will make a password. Put that in, and it will license and then you are SET.\n\n3. Enjoy!\n\nNo need to block with Little Snitch. Also, if you already have a working Mathematica 7 install, you can just install over it and skip the keygen.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/new-in-8/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/new-in-8/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d32c1c0f083b7662d53966dcecc9eb08baa0b940","amp;dn":"Wolfram+Mathematica+8.0.1+for+Windows+%2B+Keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d32c1c0f083b7662d53966dcecc9eb08baa0b940","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,44,28,15,8,59,118,98,213,57,102,220,236,201,235,8,186,160,185,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
