After consulting for him on a FBI case, she is approached by cocky yet charming ex-Army Ranger turned Special Agent, Seeley Booth to help the Bureau solve crimes by identifying human remains that are too far gone for standard FBI forensic investigations. Brennan's empirical, literal view of the world causes friction with Booths emotive, instinctive attitude creating a volatile relationship. However as their case load increases the symbiotic partnership produces results and with the support of Brennan's Squint Squad, more and more cases are closed successfully.\nIn season 5 Booth and Bones as well as Angela and Hodgins have to work out their feelings for each other, and how this effects their working relationship. Camille learns how to be a mother and Sweets has to decide between love and carrier.\n\n\nFormat :\tXvid\nFile size:  \t350MiB avg per episode\nDuration : \t42min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t624 pixels\nHeight : \t352 pixels\nAspect ratio : \t16:9\nFrame rate : \t23.976 fps\nAudio: \t\tMP3\nNr. of Files:   22 +1(Trailer by [man-o-tor]\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original filenames intact, I don't take credit for what I didn't do!
