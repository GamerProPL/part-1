Rather than leave the 60+ GB of files that will never be used on my external to take up space (which I could use for comic books), I'm going to burn them off to blu-ray data discs and file them away in hopes that they may be used at some point in the future.\n\nNo big descriptions or explanations with these - you either know what they are, and that you want them, or you don't.\n\nThese uploads are definitely an experiment; if there is interest, I'll seed them for a while, but if there isn't, I'll have them deleted and &quot;file&quot; this stuff away. \t\t\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes, I'm aware these are &quot;Advanced&quot; Dungeons &amp; Dragons, but I'm sticking with using Dungeons and Dragons in the title of all these torrents so they all come up in one search.\n\nAD&amp;D Ravenloft collection, includes 2.0, 3.0, 3.5 and third party D20 supplements.
