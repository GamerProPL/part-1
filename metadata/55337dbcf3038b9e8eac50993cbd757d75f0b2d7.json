If it is, and you still don't see any games to join, select 'filters', and change 'close' to 'far' or 'worldwide'.  Don't worry about the pings on 'worldwide' servers, the game's netcode is written so well that the game plays PERFECTLY FINE on a server that's halfway around the world!\n\nHave fun!  Let me know if it works with UPDATE 12 too!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55337dbcf3038b9e8eac50993cbd757d75f0b2d7","amp;dn":"PayDay+2+-+Multiplayer+MP+Fix+v6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55337dbcf3038b9e8eac50993cbd757d75f0b2d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,51,125,188,243,3,139,158,142,172,80,153,60,189,117,125,117,240,178,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
