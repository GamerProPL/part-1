Digital Audio Editing gives you the techniques, from the simplest corrective editing like cutting, copying, and pasting to more complex creative editing, such as beat mapping and time-stretching. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to avoid unnatural-sounding pitch correction and understand the potential pitfalls you face when restoring classic tracks. Author Simon Langford invites you to see editing with his wide-angle view, putting this skill into a broad context that will inform your choices even as you more skillfully manipulate sound. Focusing on techniques applicable to any digital audio workstation, it includes break-outs giving specific keystrokes and instruction in AvidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pro Tools, AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Logic Pro, SteinbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cubase, and PreSonusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Studio One. The companion websites includes tutorials in all four software packages to help you immediately apply the broad skills from the book. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c1ba9edd5dc6c7c1ec4d842783d11123ea0f53f","amp;dn":"Digital+Audio+Editing+Correcting+and+Enhancing+Audio+in+Pro+Tool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c1ba9edd5dc6c7c1ec4d842783d11123ea0f53f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,27,169,237,213,220,108,124,30,196,216,66,120,61,17,18,62,160,245,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
