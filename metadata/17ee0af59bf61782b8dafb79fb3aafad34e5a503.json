Kalare has also seized valuable hostages that could mean the difference between victory and failure. And Amara, the First Lord's Cursor, has been tasked with their rescue. She has earned this trust but are her allies as worthy - or does the Lady Aquitaine see the time as ripe for betrayal? Treachery is rife elsewhere, as young Tavi of Calderon will find. Posted away from the war, Tavi joins a legion anyway, under an assumed name. Then Kalare does the unthinkable - uniting with the brutish Canim. When treason wipes out the army's command structure, Tavi finds himself leading an inexperienced legion against the might of the Canim horde - the very last resort of a war-torn realm.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCaptain's Fury \n(Unabridged)\nJim Butcher\nBook 4 of the Codex Alera\nNarrated by Kate Reading\nLength: 19:34:21\nSize: 279 MB\nNumber of files: 5\nBit rate: 32kbps Mono\nFile Type: .m4b\n\nAfter years of war with the invading Canim, Tavi of Calderon, now Captain of the First Aleran Legion, uncovers information about an even greater threat, and must risk everything to forge a desperate alliance between the Aleran and Cane to take on their mutual enemy.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrinceps' Fury (Unabridged)\nJim Butcher\nBook 5 of the Codex Alera\nNarrated by Kate Reading\nLength: 17:47:00\nSize: 250 MB\nNumber of files: 5\nBit rate: 32kbps Mono\nFile Type: .m4b\n\nAfter achieving a fragile alliance with the savage Canim, Tavi of Calderon is confronted by an invasion by the Vord, which forces the Aleran legions and Canim warriors into a desperate battle against a dreaded mutual enemy.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst Lord's Fury (Unabridged)\nJim Butcher\nBook 6 of the Codex Alera\nNarrated by Kate Reading\nLength: 24:01:33\nSize: 341 MB\nNumber of files: 7\nBit rate: 32kbps Mono\nFile Type: .m4b\n\nLegendary man of war and the rightful First Lord of Alera, Gaius Octavian must save his world from eternal darkness, and stand against the savage Vord in the Calderon Valley.
