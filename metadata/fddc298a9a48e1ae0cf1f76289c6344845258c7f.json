Bringing together a new band of musicians, Bailey Rae recorded the album mainly in Leeds and Manchester, England. Her voice, always an expressive and soulful instrument, resonates with a poignant and newfound depth on The Sea. Loss and grief are recurring themes yet a sense of beauty and wonder ultimately radiates from the album's dark corners.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fddc298a9a48e1ae0cf1f76289c6344845258c7f","amp;dn":"Corinne+Bailey+Rae+-+The+Sea+%5Bmp3-256-2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fddc298a9a48e1ae0cf1f76289c6344845258c7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,220,41,138,154,72,225,174,12,241,247,98,137,198,52,72,69,37,140,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
