Hair care expert Christine Shahin shows you how to use nontoxic natural plant pigments - henna, indigo, amla, and cassis - to colour your hair naturally, and with beautiful results! These pigments are readily available at natural food stores and online; they're simple, safe, and easy to use; and they cost much less than a trip to the salon. With clearly written instructions and step-by- step photography, Shahin shows you exactly how to apply these pigments, alone or in combinations, to achieve a full range of shades of brown, black, and red. She also includes instructions for transitioning from chemical dyes to natural ones and for using chemical and natural dyes together","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a66a1f80e2a6561df248d5d08f0252c4939a11d2","amp;dn":"Natural+Hair+Coloring+%282016%29+%28Pdf%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a66a1f80e2a6561df248d5d08f0252c4939a11d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,106,31,128,226,166,86,29,242,72,213,208,143,2,82,196,147,154,17,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
