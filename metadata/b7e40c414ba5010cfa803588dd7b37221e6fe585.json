But in industrial production, and even in the modern kitchen, one important ingredient is often left out of bread making time. As the experienced bakers from the Real Bread Campaign will tell you, long and slow is far more satisfying than a quick finish. A long-proved loaf has more time to develop flavour, has a better texture and, in the case of genuine sourdough, might actually have health benefits. \r\n\r\nSlow Dough: Real Bread shares with you secrets from the experts on how to make a huge array of slow-rise breads at home from basic brown, white and rye breads, to impressive loaves such as fig and fennel sourdough or goat's cheese and honey maslin, to a range tea breads, pizza doughs and classic international breads. You'll learn how to make different starters for different breads, as well as the fundamental processes: fermenting, kneading, proving, and baking. Treating Real Bread with the respect it deserves, there are also recipes such as gingery treacle tart, breadcrumb pakoras and panzanella for using up any that you may have left over, so you don't waste a crumb. \r\n\r\nIn a world of mass-production and unnecessary artificial additives, this book about real craftsmanship is like a breath of fresh air","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7e40c414ba5010cfa803588dd7b37221e6fe585","amp;dn":"Slow+Dough+%282016%29+%28Epub%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7e40c414ba5010cfa803588dd7b37221e6fe585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,228,12,65,75,165,1,12,250,128,53,136,221,123,55,34,30,111,229,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
