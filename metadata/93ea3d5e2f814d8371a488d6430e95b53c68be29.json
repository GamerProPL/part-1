Primatte 5.1 has a simplified interface and new tools to help your mask look amazing. Just click-and-drag to define the color that you want to remove, and leave your subject on a transparent layer. Primatte keeps details that are often difficult, like wispy hair and sheer fabric. \n\nVoila! After the mask is perfect, you can use the new Backdrop features to add a custom backdrop or overlay a logo within Primatte. Get the flexibility to add in any background your client wants to see... after the photo shoot.\n\nImproved AutoMask: The best new feature in Primatte Chromakey is its incredible auto-masking. The AutoMask button has been completely redone to make your keying process on every image easier and with a high success rate. High volume photographers will see an improved and easier workflow. \n\nSuccessful Batching: Primatte works fluidly with Adobe Photoshop's Actions and Batches. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re dealing with 500 school kids shot against greenscreen, you want to process the photographs inbatch groups. You don't want to examine and mask each photo individually. Go home to get some sleep while Primatte does the work. \n\nAdd Custom Backdrops: A new Backdrop feature adds custom backgrounds directly within Primatte. The ability to add new backgrounds makes for a smoother, speedier workflow with many types of green screen photography. Put your client in Maui or on safari without going into Photoshop.\n\nAdd Logo Overlays: An Overlay feature adds text or a logo for easy customer branding directly within Primatte. Overlays are especially useful if you want to do everything at once when creating a batch process with Primatte, as you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to go in to Photoshop to add a team logo. \n\nSimplified interface: Primatte Chromakey 3.0 and 3.5 users will notice that new tools have appeared and others have been reorganized. We changed the way some features appear in order to make the interface less cluttered. We continued this streamlining process in version 5.0 and are positive that the new interface will speed up your workflow.\n\nPowerful edge removal: Primatte software really shows its power when dealing with soft edges or semi-transparent areas. The Photoshop plugin easily creates a mask around areas of detail that are typically difficult to keep. Flyaway hair, a crystal glass, sheer material, even smoke and water. We keep 'em all for you. \n\nRemove difficult spill: An important part of Primatte Chromakey software is its built-in removal of color spill. During a photoshoot, light bounces off the screen and may throw an undesirable color tint on your subject. Primatte Chromakey software will remove that unwanted color, like green spill on a model's blonde hair. \n\nFix Uneven Lighting: The new Fix Lighting tool helps with better keying around wrinkles, hotspots and shadows in unevenly lit screens. The new BG Blur tool will blur a custom background image to help simulate depth of field.\n\nBetter Light Wrap: An improved Light Wrap feature gives more realistic compositing of keyed subject against a custom background. Light Wrap generates a soft glow for the illusion that light from the background layer is reflecting along the edges of your subject.\n\nSimple Transforms: In Primatte 5.1, your subject, backdrop or overlay can be moved, scaled and rotated with simple Transform controls. If you click multiple checkboxes, you can even transform those images together.\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n-Windows XP (64 bit), Vista, 7, 8 (32-64 bit)\n-Adobe Photoshop CS2 to CC\n-Adobe Elements 9.0 to 12.0\n\nLanguage : English\n\nHomepage :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.digitalanarchy.com/primatte/main.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.digitalanarchy.com/primatte/main.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93ea3d5e2f814d8371a488d6430e95b53c68be29","amp;dn":"Digital+Anarchy+Primatte+Chromakey+5.1.2+for+Photoshop+%5BChingLiu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93ea3d5e2f814d8371a488d6430e95b53c68be29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,234,61,94,47,129,77,131,113,164,136,214,67,14,149,181,60,104,190,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
