After German band Heaven Shall Burn heard some solo demo material,\n they asked him to provide piano-and-strings pieces for their 2004 album Antigone. The Erased Tapes label heard the album, was\n impressed with Arnalds' contributions, and contacted him about recording a full album of material in that vein. The life-cycle \nconcept album Eulogy for Evolution, released in 2007, was the result, with Arnalds Ã¢â‚¬â€ primarily on piano Ã¢â‚¬â€ supported by a string\n quartet. A trio of EPs followed in 2008 and 2009. In 2010, Arnalds provided the scores for the 13-minute short Blinky TM and \nthe feature-length Ãƒâ€œrÃƒÂ³i (Jitters), and he also released Ã¢â‚¬Â¦And They Have Escaped the Weight of Darkness, his second proper album.\n His score for Sam Levinson's Another Happy Day (2011) greatly increased his profile, as he continued to release works like Stare\n (2012) Ã¢â‚¬â€ a collaborative EP with Nils Frahm Ã¢â‚¬â€ and For Now I Am Winter (2013).\n\n============================================\n\nAlbums\n\n(2007) Olafur Arnalds - Eulogy for Evolution\n(2008) Ãƒâ€œlafur Arnalds - Variations of Static\n(2009) Ãƒâ€œlafur Arnalds - Dyad 1909\n(2009) Ãƒâ€œlafur Arnalds - Found Songs\n(2010) Ãƒâ€œlafur Arnalds - ...And they have escaped the weight of darkness\n(2011) Ãƒâ€œlafur Arnalds - Another Happy Day (OST)\n(2011) Ãƒâ€œlafur Arnalds - Living Room Songs\n(2012) Ãƒâ€œlafur Arnalds - Kiasmos - Thrown EP\n(2012) Olafur Arnalds - Two Songs for Dance EP\n(2012) Ãƒâ€œlafur Arnalds &amp; Nils Frahm - Stare EP\n(2013) Ãƒâ€œlafur Arnalds - For Now I Am Winter\n(2014) Ãƒâ€œlafur Arnalds - Gimme Shelter\n\n==========================================\n\nGeneral\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nFile size                                : 1.54 GB\nPerformer                                : OÃŒï¿½lafur Arnalds &amp; Nils Frahm\nGenre                                    : Neo-Classical,electronic,piano\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 557 Kbps - 900 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c28da13c8c4153b88095862be3e5158f359106cf","amp;dn":"Olafur+Arnalds+-+Discography+%282007-2014%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c28da13c8c4153b88095862be3e5158f359106cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,141,161,60,140,65,83,184,128,149,134,43,227,229,21,143,53,145,6,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
