The former Shawn Carter grew up in poverty, which fueled his desire to become the best rapper in the business, and this CD certainly proves that he achieved his goal...and then some! His recorded output remains revolutionary and groundbreaking and his back catalogue continues to sell. This collection features a similar track listing to Chapter One: Greatest Hits but drops 'Sunshine', 'Streets Is Watching', 'Feelin' It' and 'Can't Knock The Hustle' and replaces them with 'Ride Or Die', 'Brooklyn's Finest', 'Friend Or Foe', 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Friend Or Foe '98'. Sony/BMG. 2006..\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] &quot;Can I Get A...&quot;\n[02] Hard Knock Life (The Ghetto Anthem)\n[03] Wishing On A Star (D Influence Remix)\n[04] Can't Knock The Hustle\n[05] Ain't No Nigga\n[06] Ride Or Die\n[07] Brooklyn's Finest\n[08] Imaginary Player\n[09] Friend Or Foe\n[10] Friend Or Foe '98\n[11] Money, Cash, Hoes\n[12] The City Is Mine\n[13] Reservoir Dogs\n[14] I Know What Girls Like\n[15] 22 Two's\n[16] Money Ain't A Thang\n[17] Dead Presidents II\n[18] Regrets\n\nPlay Time - 01h:17m:30s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 183mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
