This means that womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voices are still not heard equally in the decisions that most affect our lives. In Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg examines why womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s progress in achieving leadership roles has stalled, explains the root causes, and offers compelling, commonsense solutions that can empower women to achieve their full potential. \n\nSandberg is the chief operating officer ofand is ranked on FortuneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s list of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business and as one of TimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 100 Most Influential People in the World. In 2010, she gave an electrifying TEDTalk in which she described how women unintentionally hold themselves back in their careers. Her talk, which became a phenomenon and has been viewed more than two million times, encouraged women to Ã¢â‚¬Å“sit at the table,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ seek challenges, take risks, and pursue their goals with gusto.\n\nIn Lean In, Sandberg digs deeper into these issues, combining personal anecdotes, hard data, and compelling research to cut through the layers of ambiguity and bias surrounding the lives and choices of working women. She recounts her own decisions, mistakes, and daily struggles to make the right choices for herself, her career, and her family. She provides practical advice on negotiation techniques, mentorship, and building a satisfying career, urging women to set boundaries and to abandon the myth of Ã¢â‚¬Å“having it all.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ She describes specific steps women can take to combine professional achievement with personal fulfillment and demonstrates how men can benefit by supporting women in the workplace and at home. \n\nWritten with both humor and wisdom, SandbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book is an inspiring call to action and a blueprint for individual growth. Lean In is destined to change the conversation from what women canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do to what they can.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReviews:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Lean In is an inauguration more than a last word, and an occasion for celebration... Many, many women, young and old, elite and otherwise, will find it prescriptive, refreshing, and perhaps even revolutionary.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n--Anna Holmes, The New Yorker\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A landmark manifesto... Fifty years after The Feminine Mystique... Sandberg addresses 21st-century issues that never entered Betty FriedanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wildest dreams... Lean In will be an influential book. It will open the eyes of women who grew up thinking that feminism was ancient history, who recoil at the word but walk heedlessly through the doors it opened. And it will encourage those women to persevere in their professional lives.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n--Janet Maslin, The New York Times\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Inspirational... Sandberg offers concrete suggestions on how to make our work and home life more satisfying and successful.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n--Kare Anderson, Forbes\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Grade: A... a rallying cry to working women... Lean In is the most cogent piece of writing IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve encountered that speaks to the internal and institutional forces that can trip up an ambitious woman, whether she has a baby on board or not... The wisdom she shares here is a gift that all women (and all partners who support them, in the workplace or at home) should give themselves.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n--Meeta Agrawal, Entertainment Weekly\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“If you loved Sheryl SandbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incredible TEDTalk on why we have too few women leaders, or simply believe as I do that we need equality in the boardroom, then this book is for you. AsCOO, Sheryl Sandberg has firsthand experience of why having more women in leadership roles is good for business as well as society. Lean In is essential reading for anyone interested in righting the injustice of this inequality.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n--Sir Richard Branson, chairman, the Virgin Group\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A muscular manifesto on the gender inequities of the professional world... Sandberg is making a disruptive, crucial observation that puts her very much in line with Friedan: All is not just in the gendered world, and we should be talking urgently about how to make it better.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n--Rebecca Traister, Los Angeles Times\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSheryl Sandberg is chief operating officer atPrior toshe was vice president of Global Online Sales and Operations at Google and chief of staff at the U.S. Treasury Department.
