Topics include developing a concept that communicates the right message and is appropriate for both the client and the market; defining how the client's long-term goals might affect the look and needs of the mark; choosing colors and typefaces; avoiding common mistakes; and deciphering why some logos are successful whereas others are not.\nThe second half of the book comprises in-depth case studies on logos designed for various industries. Each case study explores the design brief, the relationship with the client, the time frame, and the results.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87de8c965ffedac19d91804494a934dca4892c59","amp;dn":"Logo+Design+Workbook%3A+A+Hands-On+Guide+to+Creating+Logos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87de8c965ffedac19d91804494a934dca4892c59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,222,140,150,95,254,218,193,157,145,128,68,148,169,52,220,164,137,44,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
