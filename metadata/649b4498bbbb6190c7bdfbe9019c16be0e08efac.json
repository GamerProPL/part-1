It chronicles the author's childhood and youth in rural Pennsylvania, USA, focusing on her complex relationship with her father. The book addresses themes of sexual orientation, gender roles, suicide, dysfunctional family life, and the role of literature in understanding oneself and one's family. Writing and illustrating Fun Home took seven years, in part because of Bechdel's laborious artistic process, which includes photographing herself in poses for each human figure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:649b4498bbbb6190c7bdfbe9019c16be0e08efac","amp;dn":"Fun+Home%3A+A+Family+Tragicomic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"649b4498bbbb6190c7bdfbe9019c16be0e08efac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,155,68,152,187,187,97,144,199,189,251,233,1,156,22,190,14,8,239,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
