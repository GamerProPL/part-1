Throughout the book, Harris argues that there are important truths to be found in the experiences of such contemplativesÃ¢â‚¬â€and, therefore, that there is more to understanding reality than science and secular culture generally allow.\n\nWaking Up is part seekerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s memoir and part exploration of the scientific underpinnings of spirituality. No other book marries contemplative wisdom and modern science in this way, and no author other than Sam HarrisÃ¢â‚¬â€a scientist, philosopher, and famous skepticÃ¢â‚¬â€could write it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43c8382fd3990c64ff413fafe26a0c0258feb191","amp;dn":"Waking+Up%3A+A+Guide+to+Spirituality+Without+Religion+%5BAudiobook%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43c8382fd3990c64ff413fafe26a0c0258feb191","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,200,56,47,211,153,12,100,255,65,63,175,226,106,12,2,88,254,177,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
