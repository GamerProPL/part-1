We fixed them.\r\n- The app used to quit unexpectedly when using the Gradient Tool on OS X 10.9.5. We fixed this.\r\n\r\nMADE IN UKRAINE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba5b7bddfc14e3ace210c5f0ef5f957cc84c77ee","amp;dn":"Pixelmator+3.4.2+%5BMAC+OS+X%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba5b7bddfc14e3ace210c5f0ef5f957cc84c77ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,91,123,221,252,20,227,172,226,16,197,240,239,95,149,124,200,76,119,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
