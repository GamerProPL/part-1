The assassin, Bill, and his circle known\nas The Vipers left The Bride for dead, but unluckily for them she was merely\ncomatose. Four years later, The Bride suddenly awakens from her coma and\nrealizes what has been done to her. She sets off on a ferociously focused\nmission, setting out to seek revenge on her former master and his deadly\nsquad of assassins. One by one, she kills the various members of the\nassassin group. She saves Bill for last.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Uma Thurman.\n=&gt;-David Carradine.\n=&gt;-Daryl Hannah.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Quentin Tarantino.\n\nKill Bill Vol 2.\nQuentin Tarantino's sprawling homage to action films of both the East and the\nWest reaches its conclusion in this continuation of 2003's ultra-violent Kill\nBill Vol. 1. Having dispatched several of her arch-enemies in the first film,\nThe Bride (Uma Thurman) continues in Kill Bill Vol. 2 on her deadly pursuit\nof her former partners in the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, who, in a\nfurious assault, attempted to murder her and her unborn child on her wedding\nday. As The Bride faces off against allies-turned-nemeses Budd\n(Michael Madsen) and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), she flashes back to the day\nof her deadly wedding, and we learn of how she was recruited to join the\nDiVAS, her training under unforgiving martial arts master Pai Mei (Liu Chia-hui)\nand her relationship with Squad leader Bill (David Carradine), which changed\nfrom love to violent hatred. Originally planned as a single film, Kill Bill\ngrew into an epic-scale two-part project totaling more than four hours in\nlength; as with the first film, Kill Bill Vol. 2 includes appearances by\ngenre-film icons Sonny Chiba, Michael Parks, Larry Bishop, and Sid Haig\nWu-Tang Clan producer and turntablist RZA and filmmaker and composer Robert\nRodriguez both contributed to the musical score.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Uma Thurman.\n=&gt;-David Carradine.\n=&gt;-Michael Madsen.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Quentin Tarantino.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Action : Crime.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2003 : 2004.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.27 GiB : 1.57 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 640 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 50mn : 2h 16mn.\n=&gt;-Kill Bill Vol 2............: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378194/\n=&gt;-Kill Bill Vol 1............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kill_bill_vol_1/\n=&gt;-Kill Bill Vol 2............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kill_bill_volume_2/\n\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.35:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 544.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 525 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 209 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05d1025d69c79184f045dc6d1936792512b9a2eb","amp;dn":"Kill+Bill+Volume+1+and+2+-+Quentin+Tarantino+Action+Eng+Subs+720","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05d1025d69c79184f045dc6d1936792512b9a2eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,209,2,93,105,199,145,132,240,69,220,109,25,54,121,37,18,185,162,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
