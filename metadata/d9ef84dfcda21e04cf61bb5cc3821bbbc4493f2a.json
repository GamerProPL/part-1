It's my first in a few years because I've been a little busy with TV stuff and interwebs stuff and live stage show stuff. Sure, I've been cooking, but it s been mostly to feed myself and people in my immediate vicinity which is really what a cook is supposed to do, right? Well, one day I was sitting around trying to organize my recipes, and I realized that I should put them into a personal collection. One thing led to another, and here's the Every Day Cook. There's still plenty of science and hopefully some humor in here (my agent says that's my wheelhouse ), but unlike in my other books, a lot of attention went into the photos, which were all taken on my iPhone (take that, Instagram) and are suitable for framing. As for the recipes, which are arranged by time of day, they re pretty darned tasty. \r\n\r\nHighlights include: \r\n\r\nMorning: Buttermilk Lassi, Overnight Coconut Oats, Nitrous Pancakes\r\n\r\nCoffee Break: Cold Brew Coffee, Lacquered Bacon, Seedy Date Bars\r\n\r\nNoon: Smoky the Meat Loaf, Grilled Cheese Grilled Sandwich, EnchiLasagna or Lasagnalada \r\n\r\nAfternoon: Green Grape Cobbler, Crispy Chickpeas, Savory Greek Yogurt Dip\r\n\r\nEvening: Bad Day Bitter Martini, Mussels-O-Miso, Garam Masalmon Steaks\r\n\r\nAnytime: The General's Fried Chicken, Roasted Chile Salsa, Peach Punch Pops\r\nLater: Cider House Fondue, Open Sesame Noodles, Chocapocalypse Cookie \r\nSo let's review: 101 recipes with mouthwatering photos, a plethora of useful insights on methods, tools, and ingredients all written by an award-winning and influential educator and tastemaker. That last part is from the PR office. Real people don't talk like that.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9ef84dfcda21e04cf61bb5cc3821bbbc4493f2a","amp;dn":"Alton+Brown+-+EVERYDAYCOOK+%282016%29+%28Epub%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9ef84dfcda21e04cf61bb5cc3821bbbc4493f2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,239,132,223,205,162,30,4,207,97,187,92,195,130,27,187,196,73,63,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
