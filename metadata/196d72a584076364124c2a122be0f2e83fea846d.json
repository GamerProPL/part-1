Instead, The Hunting Party is designed as a return to rock, evoking the group's earliest records. Reconnecting with the past is a standard move for a heavy band 15 years into its career, but The Hunting Party is effectively aggressive, partially due to how far into the ether Linkin Park strayed on Living Things and, especially, A Thousand Suns. Written and recorded over the course of a year, The Hunting Party nevertheless packs a visceral punch. Hints of the murky, meditative darkness linger -- especially on &quot;Until It's Gone,&quot; which builds upon its atmosphere to reach melodramatic heights; &quot;Final Masquerade&quot; is subtler in its approach -- but there's good reason why Page Hamilton and Tom Morello both guest on the record: this is a grinding, metallic workout. Far from sounding as if they're grasping at straws, Linkin Park seem rejuvenated, proving there is value in the clichÃƒÂ© of returning to roots.\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFile size                                : 104 MiB\nDuration                                 : 45mn 15s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Constant\nOverall bit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                                    : The Hunting Party\nAlbum/Performer                          : Linkin Park\nPart/Total                               : 1\nTrack name/Total                         : 12\nGrouping                                 : Alternative PopRock/Heavy Metal/Alternative Metal/Post-Grunge/Rap-Metal/AlternativeIndie Rock/Rap-Rock/NÃƒÂ¼ Metal\nPerformer                                : Linkin Park/Rakim\nComposer                                 : William Griffin/Daron Malakian/Linkin Park\nEncoded by                               : Callixtus\nPublisher                                : Warner Bros.\nGenre                                    : Pop/Rock\nRecorded date                            : 2014\nWriting library                          : LAME3.98r\nCopyright                                : Callixtus\nCover                                    : Yes\nCover type                               : Cover (front)\nCover MIME                               : image/jpeg\nEncoder                                  : Callixtus\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\nDuration                                 : 45mn 15s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\n\n\n\n1 Keys to the Kingdom\n2 All For Nothing (feat.
