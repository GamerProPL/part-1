Brooks remarkably identifies and articulates the nuances and unconsidered realities of what a zombie war would look like. This intriguing &quot;oral history&quot; stands apart from his previous zombie-related book, The Zombie Survival Guide, as Brooks uses the postwar culture here to provide political and social commentary on a wide range of real-life individuals and institutions. An all-star cast including Alan Alda, Mark Hamill, JÃƒÂ¼rgen Prochnow, Henry Rollins, John Turturro, Rob and Carl Reiner, and many others deliver their parts with such fervor and intensity that listeners cannot help but empathize with these characters. Max Brooks acts as the interviewer, providing an inquisitive but stagnant demeanor. The abridgment keeps the story tight but struggles with the interviewer&amp;#039;s narration during interviews. When Brooks interrupts characters to indicate that the person rolled his eyes or appeared apprehensive, his comments are often moot because the performers are already portraying such body language with their tone.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/World-War-Z-History-Zombie/dp/0739340131/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-9020980-5474563?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1194870068&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/World-War-Z-History-Zombie/dp/0739340131/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-9020980-5474563?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1194870068&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6110e0be00aff9acd264860d795333080a1826b6","amp;dn":"World+War+Z+-+Max+Brooks+%28Abridged+Audio+Book%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6110e0be00aff9acd264860d795333080a1826b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,16,224,190,0,175,249,172,210,100,134,13,121,83,51,8,10,24,38,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
