Now, this classic has been substantially revised and updated to include the latest information on all the important topics in electrical engineering today. Every electrical engineer should have an opportunity to expand his expertise with this definitive guide.\nIn a single volume, this handbook provides a complete reference to answer the questions encountered by practicing engineers in industry, government, or academia. This well-organized book is divided into 12 major sections that encompass the entire field of electrical engineering, including circuits, signal processing, electronics, electromagnetics, electrical effects and devices, and energy, and the emerging trends in the fields of communications, digital devices, computer engineering, systems, and biomedical engineering. A compendium of physical, chemical, material, and mathematical data completes this comprehensive resource. Every major topic is thoroughly covered and every important concept is defined, described, and illustrated. Conceptually challenging but carefully explained articles are equally valuable to the practicing engineer, researchers, and students.\nA distinguished advisory board and contributors including many of the leading authors, professors, and researchers in the field today assist noted author and professor Richard Dorf in offering complete coverage of this rapidly expanding field. No other single volume available today offers this combination of broad coverage and depth of exploration of the topics. The Electrical Engineering Handbook will be an invaluable resource for electrical engineers for years to come.\n\n\npages 2752 pages\n\nPublisher: CRC Press; 2 edition (September 26, 1997)\n\nLanguage: English\n\nISBN-10: 0849385741\n\nISBN-13: 978-0849385742\n\nProduct Dimensions: 10.3 x 8.7 x 3 inches\n\nShipping Weight: 7.1 pounds","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e8823f1f019131c7329e8bc1337d7922315221f","amp;dn":"The+Electrical+Engineering+Handbook+Second+Edition%5BA4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e8823f1f019131c7329e8bc1337d7922315221f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,136,35,241,240,25,19,28,115,41,232,188,19,55,215,146,35,21,34,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
