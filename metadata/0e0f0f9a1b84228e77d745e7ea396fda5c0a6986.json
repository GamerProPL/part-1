Even though robotics is a complex subject, several other tools along with Python can help you design a project to create an easy-to-use interface.\n\nLearning Robotics Using Python is an essential guide for creating an autonomous mobile robot using popular robotic software frameworks such as ROS using Python. It also discusses various robot software frameworks and how to go about coding the robot using Python and its framework. It concludes with creating a GUI-based application to control the robot using buttons and slides.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you'll have a clear idea of how to integrate and assemble all things into a robot and how to bundle the software package","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e0f0f9a1b84228e77d745e7ea396fda5c0a6986","amp;dn":"Learning+Robotics+Using+Python+-+Lentin+Joseph","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e0f0f9a1b84228e77d745e7ea396fda5c0a6986","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,15,15,154,27,132,34,142,119,215,69,231,234,57,111,218,92,10,105,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
