He is one of those rare chefs who is simply born. He is an artist.&quot;\nAnd so begins the rise of Hassan Haji, the unlikely gourmand who recounts his life's journey in Richard Morais' charming novel, The Hundred-Foot Journey. Lively and brimming with the colors, flavors, and scents of the kitchen, The Hundred-Foot Journey is a succulent treat about family, nationality, and the mysteries of good taste. Born above his grandfather's modest restaurant in Mumbai, Hassan first experienced life through intoxicating whiffs of spicy fish curry, trips to the local markets, and gourmet outings with his mother. But when tragedy pushes the family out of India, they console themselves by eating their way around the world, eventually settling in LumiÃƒÂ¨re, a small village in the French Alps. The boisterous Haji family takes LumiÃƒÂ¨re by storm. They open an inexpensive Indian restaurant opposite an esteemed French relais (that of the famous chef Madame Mallory) and infuse the sleepy town with the spices of India, transforming the lives of its eccentric villagers and infuriating their celebrated neighbor. Only after Madame Mallory wages culinary war with the immigrant family, does she finally agree to mentor young Hassan, leading him to Paris, the launch of his own restaurant, and a slew of new adventures.\nThe Hundred-Foot Journey is about how the hundred-foot distance between a new Indian kitchen and a traditional French one can represent the gulf between different cultures and desires. A testament to the inevitability of destiny, this is a fable for the ages; charming, endearing, and compulsively readable.\n\n\nSoon to be a major motion picture starring Helen Mirren, Om Puri, Rohan Chand, Charlotte Le Bon, Juhi Chawla; directed by Lasse Hallstrom, and produced by Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, Juliet Blake, DreamWorks Studios, and Participant Media.\n\n\nEnjoy,\nNow bring me that horizon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d6ee40038704f981c0b6d9df23ea497cf39f178","amp;dn":"The+Hundred-Foot+Journey+-+Richard+C.+Morais+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d6ee40038704f981c0b6d9df23ea497cf39f178","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,110,228,0,56,112,79,152,28,11,109,157,242,62,164,151,207,57,241,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
