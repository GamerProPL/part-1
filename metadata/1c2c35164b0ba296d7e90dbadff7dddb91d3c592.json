It is usually regarded as one of the most important albums in the history of flamenco music.\n\nHis early work with Paco de Lucia produced some of the finest flamenco ever recorded and his later albums with Tomatitio paved the way for a revolutionary new flamenco style.\n\nThese later recordings would fuse numerous different musical modes, including rock and jazz. His ground-breaking album, La Leyenda del Tiempo, demonstrated just how pioneering CamarÃƒÂ³n had become with regards to flamenco song and rhythm.\n\nIn later years, his health deteriorated due to heavy smoking and drug abuse. In 1992, JosÃƒÂ© Monge CrÃƒÂºz died of lung cancer in Badalona, Spain. It was estimated that more than 100,000 people attended his funeral.\n\n\n\nCAMARÃƒâ€œN\n\nLa Leyenda del Tiempo     1979\n\n\n- CD\n- 2005\n- VersiÃƒÂ³n remasterizada\n- 320Kbps\n\n\n\n&quot;Lo mÃƒÂ¡s parecido al rock que yo he grabado ha sido &quot;La leyenda del tiempo&quot;, ahÃƒÂ­ arriesguÃƒÂ© y metÃƒÂ­ cosas que no son las mÃƒÂ¡s habituales en el cante flamenco.
