Before they were signed to a major label, they released an EP titled Richter. Many of the songs on Richter are demo versions of songs on their full length debut, Goldfinger, which was released in 1996. Though their second album, Hang-Ups, was less successful, the band still maintained a devoted fan base in the hardcore community. Their third studio LP was Stomping Ground, which sold poorly in the US but was a modest hit in some European countries, thanks to their cover of Nena's &quot;99 Luftballons&quot; sung partly in German. Their next album, Open Your Eyes (2002), was the first for their new record label, Jive/Zomba.\n\n* Track 14 featuring Mest and Good Charlotte.\n\n**********Bit Rate: 256kbps**********\n\n1. &quot;Here in Your Bedroom&quot;            3:10\n2. &quot;Mable&quot;                           2:18\n3. &quot;Miles Away&quot;                      1:55\n4. &quot;Superman&quot;                        3:05\n5. &quot;If Only&quot;                         2:25\n6. &quot;This Lonely Place&quot;               3:19\n7. &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot;                1:56\n8. &quot;Counting the Days&quot;               3:29\n9. &quot;San Simeon&quot;                      3:23\n10.&quot;99 Red Balloons&quot;                 3:54\n11.&quot;Tell Me&quot;                         2:14\n12.&quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;                  2:47\n13.&quot;Spokesman&quot;                       2:33\n14.&quot;The Innocent&quot;                    3:01\n15.&quot;Vintage Queen&quot;                   3:04\n16.&quot;Hopeless&quot;                        4:09\n17.&quot;Rio&quot;                             2:59\n\n**********PLEASE SEED**********","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23776240eaccf0f6e13c0f36e14ca1c6469fdbc5","amp;dn":"Goldfinger+-+The+Best+Of+Goldfinger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23776240eaccf0f6e13c0f36e14ca1c6469fdbc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,119,98,64,234,204,240,246,225,60,15,54,225,76,161,198,70,159,219,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
