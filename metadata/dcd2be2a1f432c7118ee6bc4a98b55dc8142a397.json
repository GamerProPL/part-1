These recipes have a common thread: simple details â€“ a squeeze of burnt lemon, a toasting of nuts, or a spoonful of piquant green\r\nsauce â€“ which elevate flash-in-the-pan plates and slowly-stirred pots alike into something special. This pared-back approach to food is simple and achievable, and will transform your everyday cooking","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcd2be2a1f432c7118ee6bc4a98b55dc8142a397","amp;dn":"Ducksoup+Cookbook+The+Wisdom+of+Simple+Cooking+%282016%29+%5BWWRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcd2be2a1f432c7118ee6bc4a98b55dc8142a397","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,210,190,42,31,67,44,113,24,238,107,196,169,139,85,220,129,66,163,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
