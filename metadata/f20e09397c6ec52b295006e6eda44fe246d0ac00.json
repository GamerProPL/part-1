The case studies covered include public vulnerabilities as well as vulnerabilities discovered by our research team, all of which cover a wide range of applications and exploitation techniques.\n\nMaking extensive use of hands-on material, AWE covers such advanced topics as DEP and ASLR evasion, precision heap spraying, function pointer overwrites, buffer space limitations, Windows driver exploits, and creating custom hand-made shellcode. You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just read about theory, but rather you will be creating exploits by hand for non-staged systems with real world applications. This is NOT an entry level course! Experience with a debugger, previous Windows exploits, and an intense tolerance for hard work is required.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f20e09397c6ec52b295006e6eda44fe246d0ac00","amp;dn":"Offensive+Security+-+Advanced+Windows+Exploitation+%28AWE%29+v+1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f20e09397c6ec52b295006e6eda44fe246d0ac00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,14,9,57,124,110,197,43,41,80,6,230,237,164,79,226,70,208,172,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
