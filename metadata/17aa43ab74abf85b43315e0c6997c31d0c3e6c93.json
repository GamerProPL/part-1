But what actually happened on March 15, 44 BC is even more gripping than Shakespeareâ€™s play. In this thrilling new book, Barry Strauss tells the real story.\r\n\r\nShakespeare shows Caesarâ€™s assassination to be an amateur and idealistic affair. The real killing, however, was a carefully planned paramilitary operation, a generalsâ€™ plot, put together by Caesarâ€™s disaffected officers and designed with precision. There were even gladiators on hand to protect the assassins from vengeance by Caesarâ€™s friends. Brutus and Cassius were indeed key players, as Shakespeare has it, but they had the help of a third manâ€”Decimus. He was the mole in Caesarâ€™s entourage, one of Caesarâ€™s leading generals, and a lifelong friend. It was he, not Brutus, who truly betrayed Caesar.\r\n\r\nCaesarâ€™s assassins saw him as a military dictator who wanted to be king. He threatened a permanent change in the Roman way of life and in the power of senators. The assassins rallied support among the common people, but they underestimated Caesarâ€™s soldiers, who flooded Rome. The assassins were vanquished; their beloved Republic became the Roman Empire. \r\n\r\nAn original, fresh perspective on an event that seems well known, Barry Straussâ€™s book sheds new light on this fascinating, pivotal moment in world history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17aa43ab74abf85b43315e0c6997c31d0c3e6c93","amp;dn":"The+Death+of+Caesar%3A+History%27s+Most+Famous+Assassination","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17aa43ab74abf85b43315e0c6997c31d0c3e6c93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,170,67,171,116,171,248,91,67,49,94,12,105,151,195,29,12,62,108,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
