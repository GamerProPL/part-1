The value chain. Five forces. Industry structure. Differentiation. Relative cost. If you want to understand how companies achieve and sustain competitive success, Michael PorterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s frameworks are the foundation. But while everyone in business may know PorterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name, many managers misunderstand and misuse his concepts.\n\nUnderstanding Michael Porter sets the record straight, providing the first concise, accessible summary of PorterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revolutionary thinking. Written with PorterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s full cooperation by Joan Magretta, his former editor at Harvard Business Review, this new book delivers fresh, clear examples to illustrate and update PorterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ideas.\n\nMagretta uses her wide business experience to translate PorterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful insights into practice and to correct the most common misconceptions about themÃ¢â‚¬â€for instance, that competition is about being unique, not being the best; that it is a contest over profits, not a battle between rivals; that strategy is about choosing to make some customers unhappy, not being all things to all customers.\n\nAn added feature is an original Q&amp;A with Porter himself, which includes answers to managersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ FAQs.\n\nEminently readable, this book will enable every manager in your organization to grasp PorterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ideasÃ¢â‚¬â€and swiftly deploy them to drive your companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s success.\n\nHardcover: 256 pages\nPublisher: Harvard Business Review Press (December 6, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1422160599\nISBN-13: 978-1422160596\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
