Author Michael Lehman reviews the history of version control and demonstrates the fundamental concepts: check-in/checkout, forking, merging, commits, and distribution. The choice of an SVC system is critical to effectively managing and versioning the assets in a software development project (from source code, images, and compiled binaries to installation packages), so the course also surveys the solutions available. Michael examines Git, Perforce, Subversion, Mercurial, and Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) in particular, describing the appropriate use, features, benefits, and optimal group size for each one.\nTopics include:\n\n    Comparing centralized vs. distributed systems\n    Saving changes and tracking history\n    Using revert or rollback\n    Working with the GUI tools\n    Using IDE and shell integration\n    Installing different systems\n    Creating a repository\n    Tagging code\n    Branching and merging code\n    Selecting a software version control system that's right for you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be19565c40df9a1227746d0abf09c5fc7ee3fd1d","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Fundamentals+of+Software+Version+Control","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be19565c40df9a1227746d0abf09c5fc7ee3fd1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,25,86,92,64,223,154,18,39,116,109,10,191,9,197,252,126,227,253,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
