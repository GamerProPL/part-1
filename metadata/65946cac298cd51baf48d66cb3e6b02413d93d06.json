The band is composed of bassist, keyboardist, and lead vocalist Geddy Lee, guitarist and backing vocalist Alex Lifeson, and drummer, percussionist and lyricist Neil Peart. The band and its membership went through a number of re-configurations between 1968 and 1974, achieving their current form when Peart replaced original drummer John Rutsey in July 1974, two weeks before the group's first United States tour. Rutsey's departure stemmed primarily from health concerns regarding his diabetes.\n\nSince the release of the band's self-titled debut album in March 1974, Rush has become known for its musicianship, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy, and philosophy. Rush's music style has changed over the years, beginning with blues-inspired heavy metal on their first album, then encompassing hard rock, progressive rock, and a period with heavy use of synthesizers.\n\nRush has won a number of Juno Awards, and was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994. Over their careers, the members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each band member winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls. As a group, Rush possesses 24 gold records and 14 platinum (3 multi-platinum) records. Rush's sales statistics place them third behind The Beatles and The Rolling Stones for the most consecutive gold or platinum studio albums by a rock band. Rush also ranks 79th in U.S. album sales, with 25 million units. Although total worldwide album sales are not calculated by any single entity, as of 2004 several industry sources estimated Rush's total worldwide album sales at over 40 million units.\n\nThe band finished the second leg of the Time Machine Tour in July 2011 and released their latest studio album, Clockwork Angels in June 2012 with a supporting tour that began in September 2012. In December 2012, it was announced that Rush would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMoving Pictures is the eighth studio album by Canadian rock band Rush. The album was recorded and mixed from October to November 1980 at Le Studio located in Morin Heights, Quebec, Canada, and released on February 12, 1981.\n\nMoving Pictures became the band's biggest selling album in the United States rising to No. 3 on the Billboard charts and remains the band's most popular and commercially successful studio recording to date. The album was one of the first to be certified multi-platinum by the RIAA upon establishment of the certification in October 1984, and eventually went quadruple platinum.\n\nFollowing the formula of their previous album, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures follows a more radio-friendly format and includes several of the band's signature tracks, including the hits &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;Limelight&quot;, the FM rock radio standard, &quot;Red Barchetta&quot;, and the band's highly praised instrumental, &quot;YYZ&quot;.\n\nMoving Pictures is one of two Rush albums listed in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2112 is the other). Kerrang! magazine listed the album at No. 43 among the &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2012, Moving Pictures was listed as the number 10 'Your Favorite Prog Rock Albums of All Time' by Rolling Stone.\n\nThe album cover art is a visual pun of movers physically carrying paintings, while several songs from the album are connected to motion pictures, with &quot;moving pictures&quot; meaning movies. This second meaning is explicitly shown on the back of the album, where a movie crew is seen filming the scene from the front cover. A third meaning is taken from bystanders who are watching the movers and are visibly emotionally moved by the paintings, making them &quot;moving pictures&quot;.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65946cac298cd51baf48d66cb3e6b02413d93d06","amp;dn":"Rush+-+Moving+Pictures+%5B1981%5D%5B2011%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65946cac298cd51baf48d66cb3e6b02413d93d06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,148,108,172,41,140,213,27,175,72,214,108,179,230,176,36,19,217,61,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
