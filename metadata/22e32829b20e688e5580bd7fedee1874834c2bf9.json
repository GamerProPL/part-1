It's kinda like going back in time and finding a long-lost soul station somewhere down south. Every track here is a classic - it's fun to play this CD for someone who just heard a great 'original' rap song and play the funk song it was swiped from! The music here shows lack of originality in some of today's R&amp;B; it also shows the creativity of many of the 70's and 80's funksters, even if some of them only had a couple of hits. This CD is guaranteed to liven up your next party or get together - so much better than many of the tired, safe as skim milk, moldy oldies compilations found at too many baby boomer parties today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22e32829b20e688e5580bd7fedee1874834c2bf9","amp;dn":"Millennium+Party+-+Funk+%28Big+Papi%29+70%27s+80%27s+Funk+Soul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22e32829b20e688e5580bd7fedee1874834c2bf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,227,40,41,178,14,104,142,85,128,189,127,237,238,24,116,131,76,43,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
