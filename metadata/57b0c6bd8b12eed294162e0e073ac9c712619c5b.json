Formed in 1983 under the name Legacy, the band consists of vocalist Chuck Billy, guitarists Eric Peterson and Alex Skolnick, bassist Steve DiGiorgio and drummer Gene Hoglan. In the 33 years since its inception, Testament has had numerous lineup changes, and Peterson has been the only constant member. Billy replaced former singer Steve Souza in 1986, prior to the recording of their first studio album, The Legacy, and has been a member of the band since. Billy and Peterson are the only band members to appear on every album.\r\n\r\nIn May 2016, Billy confirmed the band's forthcoming album would be entitled Brotherhood of the Snake. Of the album's lyrical content, he commented, &quot;The Brotherhood of the Snake was actually a society about 6,000 years ago that debarred all religions. It was just a fascinating topic that caught our eye and attention and spawned a lot of songs. We're going with that vibe. There will be some songs that deviate, but the majority will be around that and aliens and religion. Then I'll probably tap into my native heritage and write some songs about that. The Brotherhood of the Snake will be released on October 28, 2016,and shortly after its release, Testament will embark on a UK and European tour with Amon Amarth\r\n\r\nTestament is often credited as one of the most popular bands of the thrash metal scene.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01  Brotherhood of the Snake.mp3\r\n02  The Legacy.mp3\r\n03  Souls Of Black.mp3\r\n04  Practice What You Preach.mp3\r\n05  The Ritual.mp3\r\n\r\nCurrent members\r\n\r\n    Eric Peterson â€“ rhythm guitar, lead guitar, backing vocals (1983â€“present)\r\n    Alex Skolnick â€“ lead guitar, rhythm guitar, backing vocals (1983â€“1993, 2001, 2005â€“present)\r\n    Chuck Billy â€“ vocals (1986â€“present)\r\n    Gene Hoglan â€“ drums (1997, 2011â€“present)\r\n    Steve DiGiorgio â€“ bass (1998â€“2004, 2014â€“present)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57b0c6bd8b12eed294162e0e073ac9c712619c5b","amp;dn":"Testament+-+Souls+Are+Still+Black%28EP%292016320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57b0c6bd8b12eed294162e0e073ac9c712619c5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,176,198,189,139,18,238,210,148,22,46,14,7,58,201,199,18,97,156,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
