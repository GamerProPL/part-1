Picking it up is simple enough, but as they are leaving Texas, Bandit unwittingly picks up Carrie, a hitchhiking bride-to-be who just left her groom, Junior, at the altar. Junior, however, is the son of Sheriff Buford T. Justice. And when Buford and Junior discover what has happened, they go on a &quot;high-speed pursuit&quot; across the Southeast to catch the bandit.  \n\n\nFormat            : Matroska at 2,604 Kbps\nLength            : 2 GiB for 1h 35mn 48s 660ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC\nAspect            : 1280 x 720 (1.778) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\n\n-----------------------------\n\nSmokey and the Bandit II (1980)\n\nIt's been a few years since Cletus and the Bandit made their famous 28-hour run to Texas for a few cases of Coors.

The Bandit is unavailable this time, though, so they enlist Buford. &quot;Trigger&quot; is brought out of mothballs, a large fish is strapped to the roof of the car, and the new Bandit is on his way on another wild cross-country run. But where there is the Bandit, there is Sheriff Buford T. Justice.  \n\n\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 608 Kbps\nLength            : 2 GiB for 1h 24mn 41s 660ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC\nAspect            : 1280 x 720 (1.778) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6bcad67a505e825e1fd1a66356d2ffd941a4f55","amp;dn":"Smokey+and+the+Bandit+Box+Set+HDTV+720p+AAC%2Fh264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6bcad67a505e825e1fd1a66356d2ffd941a4f55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,188,173,103,165,5,232,37,225,253,26,102,53,109,47,253,148,26,79,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
