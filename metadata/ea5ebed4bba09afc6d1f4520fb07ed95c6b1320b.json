State. Ever.: A Florida Man Defends His Homeland by Dave Barry\r\nHardcover: 240 pages\r\nPublisher: G.P. Putnam's Sons (September 6, 2016)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 1101982608\r\nISBN-13: 978-1101982600\r\nFormat: ePub\r\n\r\nA brilliantly funny exploration of the Sunshine State from the man who knows it best: Pulitzer Prize winner and New York Timesâ€“bestselling author Dave Barry.\r\n\r\nWe never know what will happen next in Florida. We know only that, any minute now, something will.\r\nEvery few months, Dave Barry gets a call from some media person wanting to know, â€œWhat the hell is wrong with Florida?â€ Somehow, the stateÃ¢Â€â„¢s acquired an image as a subtropical festival of stupid, and as a loyal Floridian, Dave begs to differ. Sure, there was the 2000 election. And people seem to take their pants off for no good reason. And it has flying insects the size of LeBron James. But it is a great state, and Dave is going to tell you why. Join him as he celebrates Florida from Key West at the bottom to whatever it is thatÃ¢Â€â„¢s at the top, from the Sunshine StateÃ¢Â€â„¢s earliest history to the fun-fair of weirdness that it is today.\r\n\r\nItÃ¢Â€â„¢s the most hilarious book yet from â€œthe funniest damn writer in the whole countryâ€ (Carl Hiaasen, and he should know). By the end, youÃ¢Â€â„¢ll have to admit that whatever else you might think about Floridaâ€”you can never say itÃ¢Â€â„¢s boring","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea5ebed4bba09afc6d1f4520fb07ed95c6b1320b","amp;dn":"Best.+State.+Ever.+%282016%29+by+Dave+Barry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea5ebed4bba09afc6d1f4520fb07ed95c6b1320b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,94,190,212,187,160,154,252,109,31,69,32,251,7,237,149,198,177,50,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
