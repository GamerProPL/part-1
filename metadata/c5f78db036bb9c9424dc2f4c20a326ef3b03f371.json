This tends to be an issue with PCs on out-of-date versions of Windows, and tends to be solved by updating your Windows service packs and manually installing the Visual C++ 2015 runtime, but some people have been unable to do this or have found that it hasnâ€™t worked for them. \r\n\r\nWeâ€™ve statically linked Visual C++ 2015 for the win32 version of Starbound, which should hopefully clear up this issue for a lot of people. Youâ€™ll need to select â€˜Launch Starbound â€“ win32â€™ when you launch Starbound on Steam.
