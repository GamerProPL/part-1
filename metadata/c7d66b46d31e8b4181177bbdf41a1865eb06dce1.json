Streamline the workflow to create encrypted PDFs. \nSetting Document Information Add document information for converted PDF documents, \nincluding titles, subjects, author, creator and keywords. \n\nWith Foxit PDF Creator you can also edit document's metadata to archive and search \nPDFs with ease. Headers and Footers Add headers or footers for PDF pages. Choose font, \nsize and color of the text with ease, as well as set display position of headers and \nfooters in a PDF file. Watermark Add watermark to PDF documents.\n\nUse either text or image as the watermark. Rotating and setting the transparency of the \nimage are also supported. Watermarking is an ideal tool to stamp a document \nsuch as Draft or Confidential.\n\nHere are some key features of &quot;Foxit PDF Creator&quot;:\n\nSearch ability:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Many PostScript-driver based PDF creation tools create PDFs without character \nencoding information. Therefore it's not possible to do a search in the resulted PDFs. \nEven though you can look at all those characters, you can't search them. \nFoxit PDF Creator retain all character encoding information, so you can search it, \nextract it, and convert back to pure text document.\n\nDisplay and process efficiency:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Many PDF creation tools break text contents into individual characters, causing some \nperformance issues for displaying and processing. Foxit PDF Creator groups texts with \nsimilar &quot;display attributes&quot; together, which improves performance when the PDF gets d\nisplayed or processed.\n\nFile size:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Many PDF creation tools require all or many fonts to be embedded with the PDF file, \nresulting in bigger file size for the PDF. Foxit PDF Creator can reduce the file size \nfor many documents.\n\nSpeed:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Many PDF creation tools adopt a two phase creation procedure: first print to PostScript language, \nthen convert to PDF, not only is some information lost during the process, but it also takes more time. \nFoxit PDF Creator directly creates PDFs from any printing application fastest among all current \nPDF creation tools.\n\nAccuracy:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Many PDF creation tools don't handle complicated Windows drawing features like transparency \nand the generated PDFs are not identical to the original documents. Foxit PDF Creator processes \nall Windows drawing functions so your PDF is always same as your original document.\n\nCompatibility:\nAs developer of popular Foxit Reader, Foxit Software knows PDF standard very well. \nThis ensures that PDFs created by Foxit PDF Creator will have the best result in any standard PDF reader.\n\nInstall Notes:\n1) unpack rar archive\n2) Run installer, (choose FoxitPDFCreator302_enu_Setup.exe for 32Bit or FoxitPDFCreator302_x64_enu_Setup.exe 64 Bit)\n3) Copy/paste the keyfile into registration box when asked\nDone","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7d66b46d31e8b4181177bbdf41a1865eb06dce1","amp;dn":"Foxit_PDF_Creator_3.0.2.0506+%2Bkeyfile+-TrT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7d66b46d31e8b4181177bbdf41a1865eb06dce1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,214,107,70,211,30,139,65,129,23,123,189,244,26,24,101,235,6,220,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
