Malmsteen became famous and very influential for his neo-classic approach in heavy metal music, and is often seen as one of the greatest electric guitarists of all time.\n\nMalmsteen was born Lars Johan Yngve LannerbÃƒÂ¤ck in Stockholm, Sweden, as the third child of a musically-inclined family. At age seven, he saw a television news report on the death of Jimi Hendrix, an event which had a profound impact on his musical path. To quote his official website, &quot;The day Jimi Hendrix died, the thumb-sucking, molly-coddled plebeian Yngwie died, and was replaced by a Dionysian, guitar-shredding god&quot;. At the age of 10 he took his mother's maiden name Malmsten as his surname, slightly changed it to Malmsteen, and Anglicised his given name Yngve to &quot;Yngwie&quot;. Yngwie also created his first band &quot;Track On Earth&quot; at the age of 10, consisting of himself and a friend from school on drums (Armin). Malmsteen was a teenager when he first encountered the music of the 19th century violin virtuoso NiccolÃƒÂ² Paganini, whom he cites as his biggest classical music influence.\n\n\nMalmsteen is known for his technical fluency and neo-classical metal compositions, often incorporating high speed picking with harmonic minor scales, diminished scales and sweep picked arpeggios. He is often considered one of the most talented rock guitarists of all time and is considered to be a pioneer of shred guitar.\n\nAlso, Malmsteen favors the harmonic minor scale, and often uses diminished arpeggios and phrygian scales and draws an influence from Bach and Beethoven. In an interview, Malmsteen confessed that his regular use of harmonic minor was because in the 1980s he was trying to move away from the blues-based pentatonic scales that were frequently used at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nCURRENT LINE UP\nYngwie Malmsteen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars, vocals\nRalph Ciavolino Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass, vocals\nMark Ellis Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion\nNick Marino Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards, vocals\n\n\n\nTRACKLIST:\nDISC 1\n1.
