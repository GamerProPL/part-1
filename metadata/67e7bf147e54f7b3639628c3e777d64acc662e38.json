The compilation features ten of Dierks? most recognizable hits, two brand new songs, and five live songs selected exclusively by his fans! Dierks has given his loyal fans creative control of this project, allowing them to handpick the content of the album, cover art, and the album title. Participating fans will then have their names listed in the liner notes of the project as executive producers. Dierk says, &amp;#039;I can?t think of a better way to get my fans involved than to have them actually act as executive producers of this record&amp;#039;. \n\nARTIST     : Dierks Bentley\nTITLE      : Greatest Hits: Every Mile A Memory 2003-2008\nLABEL      : Capitol Records\nGENRE      : Country\nBITRATE    : 197 kbps avg\nSOURCE     : CD (LP)\nPLAYTIME   : 01:11:22\nSIZE       : 106.MB\nSTORE DATE : 2008-05-00\n\n\nTrack List\n----------\n1.
