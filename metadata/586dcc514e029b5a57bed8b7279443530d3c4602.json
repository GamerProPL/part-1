While it's important for the structure to reflect the vision and style of the architect, the client must ultimately feel at home beneath the roof. It is particularly interesting, therefore, to examine the homes that architects create for themselves. If houses reflect their owners' personalities, then architects' own homes are like autobiographies. Location, layout, style, lighting, artwork, furnishings, every detail adds color to the story. Each of these 100 dwellings, presented A-Z by architect, speaks more about its designer than any other building possibly could.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:586dcc514e029b5a57bed8b7279443530d3c4602","amp;dn":"100+Houses+for+100+European+Architects+of+the+20th+Century+%28Art+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"586dcc514e029b5a57bed8b7279443530d3c4602","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,109,204,81,78,2,155,90,87,190,216,183,39,148,67,83,13,60,70,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
