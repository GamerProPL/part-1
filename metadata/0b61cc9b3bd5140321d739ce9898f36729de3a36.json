Each design includes detailed floor plans, section drawings, elevations, and perspectives, as well as a description of the materials used and landscaping around the home.\n\nKeeping in mind that a chief priority for a small home is often energy efficiency, most of the plans incorporate some energy-efficient element. There are dozens of plans suitable for every environment and climate in the country. The designs are all a direct result of several international competitions that solicited from architects the best homes of 1,250 square feet or less. Contact information for the architects is provided in the back of the book.\n\nReviews:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author/s:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEditor and professional architect Don Metz is a partner in the architectural firm of Metz and Thornton.
