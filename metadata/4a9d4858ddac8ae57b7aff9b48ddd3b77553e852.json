CHAPTER 1.\n\nThe first episode in Mark Cousins\\' epic history of cinema reveals how this art form was born.\n\nFilmed in the buildings where the first movies were made, it shows that ideas and passion have always driven film, more than money and marketing.\n\nThe programme reveals the story of the very first movie stars, close-ups and special effects, and travels to Hollywood to show how it became a myth.\n\nThe story is full of surprises - such as the fact that the greatest and best-paid writers in these early years were women - and celebrates the glamour of the great movie cathedrals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a9d4858ddac8ae57b7aff9b48ddd3b77553e852","amp;dn":"The+Story+of+Film+-+An+Odyssey+S01E01.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a9d4858ddac8ae57b7aff9b48ddd3b77553e852","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,157,72,88,221,172,138,229,123,122,255,155,72,221,211,183,117,83,232,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
