While the group's credentials and approach follow the indie rock tradition of the '80s, sonically the Offspring sound more like an edgy, hard-driving heavy metal band, with their precise, pulsing power chords and Dexter Holland's flat vocals. Featuring Holland, guitarist Kevin &quot;Noodles&quot; Wasserman, bassist Greg Kriesel, and drummer Ron Welty, the Offspring released their self-titled debut album in 1989. Four years later, their second album, Ignition, became an underground hit, setting the stage for the across-the-board success of 1994's Smash. The Nirvana sound-alike &quot;Come Out and Play,&quot; the first single from the album, became an MTV hit in the summer of 1994, which paved the way to radio success. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n01.Time To Relax\n02.Nitro (Youth Energy)\n03.Bad Habit\n04.Gotta Get Away\n05.Genocide\n06.Something To Believe In\n07.Come Out And Play (Keep 'Em Separated)\n08.Self Esteem\n09.It'll Be A Long Time\n10.Killboy Powerhead\n11.What Happened To You\n12.So Alone\n13.Not The One\n14.Smash     *(Easter Egg - Hidden Track)\n\n\n\n\n*After the song ends, there's a long period of silence.
