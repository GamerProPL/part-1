Lately I've been listening to this set, particularly the 1st Symphony, and my opinion has changed. Now I am in absolute awe of him. Why has this collection changed my mind? In one word: bass. The low register instruments, especially the basses and cellos, stand strongly in these recordings, and the result is I'm discovering a *lot* of depth to the composition that had escaped me before. Brahms turns out to be a much better composer than other recordings had let me discover before. In certain passages, I focus totally on the low strings, just to see what they're up to, and I'm richly rewarded. Then I go back to some of my previous Brahms' recordings, and I can barely hear the same wonderful passages. Very disappointing!\n\nAside from the wonderful mix, everything else is quite fine. The tempos are crisp, the orchestra sounds magnificent, just right on.\n\nFinally, Solti should NOT be commended for including the exposition repeats. Instead, other conductors should be cursed and shunned for ever omitting them. \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0040fdd5578cab9c2056d785b2273885c73cac2d","amp;dn":"Brahms+-+The+Complete+Symphonies+-+Solti","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0040fdd5578cab9c2056d785b2273885c73cac2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,64,253,213,87,140,171,156,32,86,215,133,178,39,56,133,199,60,172,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
