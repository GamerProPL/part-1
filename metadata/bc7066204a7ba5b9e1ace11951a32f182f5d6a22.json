For some reason the stories might attract guys in the first place.. ItÃ‚Â´s the story about being someone or accieving something just to be able to get back to a decent household with wife and kids, much like the theme of traditional westernfilms. The main caracters of the life and struggle in the trailerpark is the smalltown gangsters Ricky &amp; Julian who usually canÃ‚Â´t escape their destiny to end up in jail in the end of each season. \n\nThis TV show might look like some documentary at a first glimpse, but ItÃ‚Â´s all a play with documentary conventions. The show adapted the main plot from a full length movie about Ricky &amp; Julian where julian is hiring a camera team to make a documentary about himself. Yet another full length film has been made after the TPB seasons 1 - 6. The caracters of Ricky (Robb Wells) and Julian (John Paul Tremblay)Is actually part of the real production team behind the show and the two movies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc7066204a7ba5b9e1ace11951a32f182f5d6a22","amp;dn":"Trailer+Park+Boys+-+Season+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc7066204a7ba5b9e1ace11951a32f182f5d6a22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,112,102,32,74,123,165,185,225,172,225,25,81,163,47,24,47,93,106,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
