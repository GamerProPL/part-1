His thought has exerted a profound influence on 20th century philosophy, theology, psychology, and literature.\n\nKierkegaard wrote critical texts on organized religion, Christendom, morality, ethics, psychology and philosophy of religion, displaying a fondness for metaphor, irony and parables.  Much of his philosophical work deals with the issues of how one lives as a &quot;single individual&quot;, giving priority to concrete human reality over abstract thinking, and highlighting the importance of personal choice and commitment.  His theological work focuses on Christian ethics, the institution of the Church, the differences between purely objective proofs of Christianity, the infinite qualitative distinction between man and God, and the individual's subjective relationship to the God-Man Jesus Christ, which came through faith.  Much of his work deals with the art of Christian love.\n\nWhenever I read Kierkegaard, I am reminded of Rilke's injunction: You must change your life [Du muÃƒÅ¸t dein Leben ÃƒÂ¤ndern] (from &quot;Archaic Torso of Apollo&quot;).\n\nIncluded here are a variety of English translations but the gems of this collection are the volumes from KIERKEGAARD'S WRITINGS, edited and translated by Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong, and issued by Princeton University Press.  This series represents a definitive, systematically translated, scholarly edition of Kierkegaard's works in English; each volume includes a historical introduction, selections from Kierkegaard's journals and provisional manuscripts, notes and an index.  \n\nI am indebted to pharmakate and livhre for originally uploading several of these books, some of which have been slightly modified.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n* ATTACK UPON &quot;CHRISTENDOM&quot;, 1854-1855 (Princeton University Press, 1968).
