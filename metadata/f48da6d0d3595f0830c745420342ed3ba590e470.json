They are from his book &quot;Tricks of the Mind&quot;, which I highly recommend.\n\n\nI am only making these available because if you don't live in the UK, its damn near impossible to get these, as you can only buy them from iTunes UK (or Audible), and I had to jump through a lot of BS to buy these. \n\n\nNow then...\n\n\nSOAPBOX\n***If these are available to you to purchase in your country, please do so. Derren Brown is an profound performer who is kind enough to show us how he, and Big Media, messes with our heads, and personally I think he deserves our support. These weren't that expensive, so please buy them if you can. Thank you!**\n/SOAPBOX\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\nP.S. Or if you don't want to deal with DRM bullshit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f48da6d0d3595f0830c745420342ed3ba590e470","amp;dn":"Derren+Brown+Audiobooks+-+Hypnotism%2C+Magic%2C+and+Memory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f48da6d0d3595f0830c745420342ed3ba590e470","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,141,166,208,211,89,95,8,48,199,69,66,3,66,237,59,165,144,228,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
