Yet in The Science of Interstellar, Kip Thorne, the physicist who assisted Nolan on the scientific aspects of Interstellar, shows us that the movieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jaw-dropping events and stunning, never-before-attempted visuals are grounded in real science. Thorne shares his experiences working as the science adviser on the film and then moves on to the science itself. In chapters on wormholes, black holes, interstellar travel, and much more, ThorneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scientific insightsÃ¢â‚¬â€many of them triggered during the actual scripting and shooting of InterstellarÃ¢â‚¬â€describe the physical laws that govern our universe and the truly astounding phenomena that those laws make possible","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92e730ff92b0d12c0819f6cda2fb9748a1dd5ed4","amp;dn":"The+Science+of+Interstellar+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92e730ff92b0d12c0819f6cda2fb9748a1dd5ed4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,231,48,255,146,176,209,44,8,25,246,205,162,251,151,72,161,221,94,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
