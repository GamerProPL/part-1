GREATEST HITS puts these fine finest moments on display along with a pair of previously unreleased cuts.\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins&amp;#039; greatest-hits album, Rotten Apples, traces the band&amp;#039;s evolution (or devolution, depending on your feelings about the band&amp;#039;s radical sonic shift in the mid-&amp;#039;90s) from its early days to its status among the kings of alt rock. For fans of the Pumpkins&amp;#039; beginnings as a tripped-out indie/art rock act, Apples opens with some of the band&amp;#039;s strongest material. &quot;Siva&quot; and &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; (from Gish, the Pumpkin&amp;#039;s first--and arguably best--album) seamlessly mixed dream pop with noisy goth-rock as prime examples of the Pumpkins&amp;#039; early &amp;#039;90s sound. Apples also showcases three stellar tracks (&quot;Cherub Rock,&quot; &quot;Today,&quot; and &quot;Disarm&quot;) from Siamese Dream, the Pumpkins&amp;#039; breakout album.\n\nThis disc makes the band&amp;#039;s mid-&amp;#039;90s directional swing obvious, though, starting with &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings,&quot; the aggressive alt rock/alt metal concoction released on Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. Fans of songs like &quot;Zero,&quot; &quot;Tonight, Tonight,&quot; and &quot;The Everlasting Gaze&quot; will be happy to know that pretty much every cage-rattling hit made it to this disc, along with the previously unreleased dream pop track &quot;Real Love&quot; and an untitled new track (that sounds a lot like the Siamese Dream-era Pumpkins) to round out the mix. --Jennifer Maerz\n\nCategory Rock/Pop, Rock, Punk, Alt/Indie, Alternative \nLabel Virgin Records (USA) \nOrig Year 2001 \nDiscs 1 \nStreet Date Nov 20, 2001 \nStudio/Live Studio \nMono/Stereo Stereo \nPersonnel Billy Corgan\nD&amp;#039;Arcy\nJames Iha\nJimmy Chamberlin\n\nTrack Listing \n  1.
