Melding the author's expertise as a practitioner and his years of teaching engineering mathematics, this text stands clearly apart from the many others available. \n\nRelevant, insightful examples follow nearly every concept introduced and demonstrate its practical application. This edition includes two new chapters on differential equations, another on Hilbert transforms, and many new examples, problems, and projects that help build problem-solving skills. Most importantly, the book now incorporates the use of MATLAB throughout the presentation to reinforce the concepts presented. MATLAB code is included so readers can take an analytic result, fully explore it graphically, and gain valuable experience with this industry-standard software","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:161f83df6619e19b610615d54977931846465440","amp;dn":"Advanced+Engineering+Mathematics+with+MATLAB%26reg%3B+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"161f83df6619e19b610615d54977931846465440","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,31,131,223,102,25,225,155,97,6,21,213,73,119,147,24,70,70,84,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
