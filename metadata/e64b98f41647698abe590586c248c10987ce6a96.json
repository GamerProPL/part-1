Slayer rose to fame with their 1986 release Reign in Blood, and is credited as one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; thrash metal acts, along with Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax. Slayer has never publicly revealed its worldwide sales, however between 1991 and 2004, the band sold more than 3.5 million albums in the U.S.\n\nSlayer's musical style involves fast tremolo picking, double bass drumming, riffs in irregular scales and shouted vocals. In the original line-up, King, bassist/vocalist Tom Araya and guitarist Jeff Hanneman contributed to the band's lyrics, and most of the band's music was created and arranged by King and Hanneman, with additional help from drummer Dave Lombardo and sometimes Araya. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as serial killers, necrophilia, Satanism, religion, anti-religion and warfare, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups and the public. Their music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e64b98f41647698abe590586c248c10987ce6a96","amp;dn":"Slayer-Reign+in+Blood+1986+..320kbps+%28stPaddy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e64b98f41647698abe590586c248c10987ce6a96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,75,152,244,22,71,105,138,190,89,5,134,194,72,193,9,135,206,106,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
