This series goes beyond the hypotheticals to give viewers a Ã¢â‚¬Å“virtual internshipÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ experience.\n\nThis user-directed series from Shawn Powers offers a &quot;virtual internship&quot; experience in Linux. Shawn took his cues from you, and is designing this series based on your feedback. Video #2 was created first and made available free to all viewers, who then sent in feedback on what topics they wanted covered. Shawn finished the series based on feedback he received.\n\nSubscribers were able to watch the individual videos as they were released, and to give feedback in a survey. [NOTE: All surveys connected with this series are closed now that the series is complete.]\n\nThe series is intended for all levels of Linux proficiency, so whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re new to Linux or a seasoned pro, your training needs will be met.
