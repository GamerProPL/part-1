Purification processes for groundwater, soil water, reusable water, and raw water are examined where they are in use full-scale, as a pilot approach, or in the laboratory. This book also describes the production of ceramic particles (nanochemistry) and materials for the creation of filtration systems and catalysts that are involved.\n\n\n\nUses chemistry fundamentals to explain the mechanisms behind the various purification processes\nExplains in detail process equipment and technical applications\nDescribes the production of ceramic particles and other new materials applicable to filtration systems\nIncludes worked examples","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ff2375fbd54faab58d280efa0bd3e6120788490","amp;dn":"Chemistry+of+Advanced+Environmental+Purification+Processes+of+Wa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ff2375fbd54faab58d280efa0bd3e6120788490","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,242,55,95,189,84,250,171,88,210,128,239,160,189,62,97,32,120,132,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
