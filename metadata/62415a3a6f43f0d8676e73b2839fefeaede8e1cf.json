After a series of EPs including Fire and Brimstone, Tattoos and Scally Caps, and Boys on the Docks, the Dropkick Murphys signed to Hellcat Records to issue their 1998 full-length Do or Die, produced by Rancid's Lars Frederiksen; McColgan exited the group soon after (he later went on to form the like-minded Street Dogs) and was replaced by vocalist Al Barr for the follow-up, 1999's The Gang's All Here.\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info\n\n\n01.Hang 'Em High\n02.Going Out In Style\n03.The Hardest Mile\n04.Cruel\n05.Memorial Day\n06.Climbing A Chair To Bed\n07.Broken Hymns\n08.Deeds Not Words\n09.Take 'Em Down\n10.Sunday Hardcore Matinee\n11.1953\n12.Peg O' My Heart\n13.The Irish Rover\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62415a3a6f43f0d8676e73b2839fefeaede8e1cf","amp;dn":"Dropkick+Murphys+-+Going+Out+In+Style+2011+mp3%40CBR320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62415a3a6f43f0d8676e73b2839fefeaede8e1cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,65,90,58,111,67,240,216,103,110,115,178,131,159,239,234,237,232,225,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
