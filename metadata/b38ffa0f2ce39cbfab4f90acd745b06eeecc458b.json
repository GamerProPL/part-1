They are both set in the same incredible world, where a little guy lives on a small planetoid in space.\n\nIn the first sequel, released in 2003, he has to save his home from an incoming bird-like asteroid. Although short and simplistic in its gameplay, its surreal graphics and memorable score make the game stand out. In Samorost 2, released in late 2005, aliens land on the same little guyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s planetoid, and kidnap his dog. Your mission is to rescue the poor puppy. The game has surrealistic organic scenarios that mix both natural and technological concepts, creative character designs and a unique musical atmosphere.\n\n\nOS: Mac, Windows\n\nInstall: Unzip &amp; Play\n\n\nCheers,\n\nADHDerby","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b38ffa0f2ce39cbfab4f90acd745b06eeecc458b","amp;dn":"Samorost+1+%26+2+for+Mac+%26+Windows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b38ffa0f2ce39cbfab4f90acd745b06eeecc458b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,143,250,15,44,227,156,191,171,79,144,172,215,69,176,110,238,204,69,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
