That doesn't necessarily mean that fans of the Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead will find the band to their liking, however. Mazzy Star much preferred the dark side of psychedelia, as exemplified by the most distended tracks of the Doors and the Velvet Underground. Their fuzzy guitar workouts and plaintive folky compositions are often suffused in a dissociative ennui that is very much of the '90s, however much their textures may recall the drug-induced states of vintage psychedelia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:989f3ba7e1ef9824bd106aad4595424b5d55224f","amp;dn":"Mazzy+Star+-+Seasons+of+Your+Day+%282013%29+%5BMP3+320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"989f3ba7e1ef9824bd106aad4595424b5d55224f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,159,59,167,225,239,152,36,189,16,106,173,69,149,66,75,93,85,34,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
