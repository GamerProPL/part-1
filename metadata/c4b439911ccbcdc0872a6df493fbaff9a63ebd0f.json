Marroquin, who changed his name and fled Colombia after his father was gunned down in 1993, grapples with the impossible task of reconciling the conflicting roles of his father: the doting family man he still loves, and the stone-hearted criminal who publicly threatened his enemies and their own families.\r\nIn agreeing to appear in the film, Marroquin and his mother break more than a decade of silence after living in virtual exile in Argentina, where Marroquin now works as an architect. The result is both a startlingly intimate portrait of their years in the Escobar family and a front-row view of Marroquin's reconciliation efforts toward the men his father orphaned 20 years ago.\r\nThe film also explores the recent history of Colombia, in particular its struggles to ward off the tag of &quot;narco-state&quot; while battling paramilitary groups bent on controlling the country through kidnapping, bombings and political assassination. While Pablo Escobar did not originate these guerilla tactics, he employed them in running the Medellin Cartel in the 1980s.\r\nMarroquin recounts how some called his father the &quot;Robin Hood of Colombia,&quot; who built soccer fields and a housing community for 5,000 people, and was even elected to the Colombian congress. Eventually, he was tracked down by Colombian and U.S. intelligence agencies and shot to death on a rooftop in Medellin on Dec. 2, 1993.\r\nNot content simply to recount history, Marroquin reaches across generations to ask for forgiveness. SINS OF MY FATHER chronicles his reconciliation efforts toward the sons of his father's most prominent murder victims, Colombian politicians and anti-drug crusaders Luis Carlos Galan and Rodrigo Lara Bonilla. His aim is to close wounds that extend across the history of the home they once shared in Colombia and cease the culture of revenge that has permeated the country for decades.\r\n\r\nA Film by Nicolas Entel ; Red Creek Production in association with ZDF/ARTE, Channel 4 and Discovery Channel Latin America\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9c/Sins-of-My-Father-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1b/Sins-of-My-Father-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0b/Sins-of-My-Father-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/07/Sins-of-My-Father-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/24/Sins-of-My-Father-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/41/Sins-of-My-Father-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/53/Sins-of-My-Father-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6e/Sins-of-My-Father-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c0/Sins-of-My-Father-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f9/Sins-of-My-Father-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b5/Sins-of-My-Father-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/20/Sins-of-My-Father-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e3/Sins-of-My-Father-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/09/Sins-of-My-Father-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d0/Sins-of-My-Father-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/61/Sins-of-My-Father-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 2 136 Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 720x408\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Per Second: 29.970 fps\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\r\nAudio Streams: 2\r\nAudio Languages: spanish\r\nRunTime Per Part: 1h 28mn\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 1.44 GB\r\nRipped by: DocFreak08\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nSource: \nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Sins_of_My_Father","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4b439911ccbcdc0872a6df493fbaff9a63ebd0f","amp;dn":"Sins+of+My+Father+x264+AC3+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4b439911ccbcdc0872a6df493fbaff9a63ebd0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,180,57,145,28,203,205,192,135,42,109,244,147,251,175,249,166,62,189,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
