The satire is some of Zappa's most scathing and unsympathetic, and the music is equally loud and unrelenting.\nIt is Frank Zappa at his bawdy best. SheikÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs dumbed-down hooks are still some of ZappaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most addictive.\n\n\nFrank Zappa\n\nSheik Yerbouti\n\n1979\n\n2012 Reissue\n\n \n\nCD / 2012 / Remastered (Original 1978 Analog Master)/ 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
