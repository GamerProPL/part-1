If you need a bruiser, bodyguard, fighter, raider or just an intimidating presence and someone to throw their weight around, Raoul has all situations covered and he gets the job done. Raoul comes with highly-detailed textures with several face and body options, including clean, battered, and bloody options. The blood options use the LIE (Layered Image Editor) so there may be a momentary delay when selecting these options. Raoul uses the HD morphs for Ivan 7 in all of his promos. He still looks excellent without the HD morphs, but lacks the grizzled, aging features","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dd7ed84b44f89363d73179a0232d83e81a43871","amp;dn":"DAZ3D+-+Raoul+for+Ivan+7+HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dd7ed84b44f89363d73179a0232d83e81a43871","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,215,237,132,180,79,137,54,61,115,23,154,2,50,216,62,129,164,56,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
