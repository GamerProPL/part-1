Vaughan drew equally from bluesmen like Albert King, Otis Rush, and Muddy Waters and rock &amp; roll players like Jimi Hendrix and Lonnie Mack, as well as the stray jazz guitaris like Kenny Burrell, developing a uniquely eclectic and fiery style that sounded like no other guitarist, regardless of genre. Vaughan bridged the gap between blues and rock like no other artist had since the late '60s. For the next seven years, Stevie Ray was the leading light in American blues, consistently selling out concerts while his albums regularly went gold. His tragic death in 1990 only emphasized his influence in blues and American rock &amp; roll. \n\n\nTrack List:\n\n1. Taxman\n2. Texas Flood\n3. The House Is Rockin'\n4. Pride And Joy\n5.
