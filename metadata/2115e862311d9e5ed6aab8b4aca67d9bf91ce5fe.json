In 1992, war is brewing in Bosnia, but the city fathers in the town of Golobuci are going ahead with their plans of building a railroad line they hope will bring more visitors into the city. Luka (Slavko Stimac), who is in charge of the construction project, lives with his wife, Jadranka (Vesna Trivalic), a former musician who is suffering from manic depression, and his son, Milos (Vuk Kostic), a talented soccer player who dreams of turning pro some day. After Jadranka has an especially severe episode, Luka takes her to the hospital, where he meets Sabaha (Natasa Solak), a Moslem nurse who quickly develops a nonprofessional interest in Luka. As the clouds of war appear on the horizon, Milos is drafted into the army and Jadranka runs away, and after Sabaha is left with no place to go, she's sent to Luka's place by his friend Aleksic (Stribor Kusturica), where she quickly takes over as both housekeeper and bedmate to Luka. Zivot Je Cudo (aka Life Is a Miracle) was screened in competition at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Zivot je cudo.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 2,074,726,400 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:28:04\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 704x376 (AR: 1.872)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1730 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.261 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0322420/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0322420/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Serbian | English | German | Hungarian \n\nSubtitles: English and Portuguese\n\nMy rip\n\nEmir Kusturica - Zivot je cudo [Life Is a Miracle] (2004) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2115e862311d9e5ed6aab8b4aca67d9bf91ce5fe","amp;dn":"Emir+Kusturica+-+Zivot+je+cudo+%5BLife+Is+a+Miracle%5D+%282004%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2115e862311d9e5ed6aab8b4aca67d9bf91ce5fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,21,232,98,49,29,158,94,214,170,184,180,172,166,125,155,249,28,229,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
