It was released on 12 December 1980 as a triple album containing 36 tracks, with 6 songs on each side.[1][2] Anticipating the &quot;world music&quot; trend of the 1980s, it features funk, reggae, jazz, gospel, rockabilly, folk, dub, rhythm and blues, calypso, and rap.[1][2][3] For the first time, the band's traditional songwriting credits of Strummer and Jones were replaced by a generic credit to the Clash,[2] and the band cut the album royalties, in order to release the 3-LP at a low price.[4][5]\n\nThe title refers to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, and its catalogue number, 'FSLN1', refers to the abbreviation of the party's Spanish name, Frente Sandinista de LiberaciÃƒÂ³n Nacional.[3][4][6]\n\nSandinista! was voted best album of the year in the Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll in The Village Voice, and was ranked number 404 on the Rolling Stone list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2003.[3] Slant Magazine listed the album at number 85 on its &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot; list in 2012.[7]                              Track listing\n\nThe compact disc release has the first three sides on the first CD and the latter three sides on the second CD.\n\nAll songs written and composed by The Clash, except where noted. \nSide one \t\nNo. \tTitle \tLead vocals \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;   \tJoe Strummer \t5:28\n2. \t&quot;Hitsville U.K.&quot;   \tMick Jones, Ellen Foley \t4:20\n3. \t&quot;Junco Partner&quot; (&quot;writer, at present, unknown&quot; on liner notes) \tJoe Strummer \t4:53\n4. \t&quot;Ivan Meets G.I.
