It's a slower, partially acoustic number that builds on its own emotion. The songs on Break the Cycle are drenched in melancholy melodies and slow, heavy riffs typical of the sensitive side of the alt-rock genre. Lewis sometimes breaks out\ninto either a hearty yell or a throaty gurgle that sounds like the devil vomiting (&quot;Can't Believe&quot;), but the best songs keep his passion a little more controlled. You've probably heard rock like Break the Cycle piping from mainstream radio stations already, but Lewis's ability to turn his breakdowns into his art should capture a new round of fans happy to find kindred spirits in the band. --Jennifer Maerz\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Open your eyes                                       [03:53]\n02.Pressure                                             [03:23]\n03.Fade                                                 [04:04]\n04.It's been A while                                    [04:26]\n05.Change                                               [03:37]\n06.Can't believe                                        [02:48]\n07.Epiphany                                             [04:18]\n08.Suffer                                               [03:59]\n09.Safe place                                           [04:36]\n10.For you                                              [03:27]\n11.Outside                                              [04:52]\n12.Waste                                                [03:57]\n13.Take it                                              [03:37]\n____\n\n50:57 min\n 83,7 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
