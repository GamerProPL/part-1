After releasing a couple of albums of straight-ahead Southern boogie, the band revamped its sound to fall halfway between country-fried blues-rock and driving, arena-ready hard rock. The result was a string of hit albums and singles in the early '80s, highlighted by &quot;Caught Up in You,&quot; &quot;If I'd Been the One,&quot; &quot;Back Where You Belong,&quot; and &quot;Like No Other Night.&quot; .38 Special's popularity dipped in the late '80s as MTV-sponsored pop and heavy metal cut into their audience. Though the band had its biggest hit in 1989 with the ballad &quot;Second Chance,&quot; it proved to be their last gasp -- they faded away in the early '90s, retiring to the oldies circuit.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Rockin' Into The Night\n02.Stone Cold Believer\n03.Hold On Loosely\n04.Wild-Eyed Southern Boys\n05.Fantasy Gril\n06.Caught Up In You\n07.Rough Housin'\n08.If I'd Been The One\n09.Back Where You Belong\n10.Twentieth Century Fox\n11.Somebody Like You\n12.Like No Other Night\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ecdc26b6c2d1d019c579bc80ea3e3ecebac4a26","amp;dn":"38+Special+-+The+Best+Of+38+Special+%282007%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ecdc26b6c2d1d019c579bc80ea3e3ecebac4a26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,205,194,107,108,45,29,1,156,87,155,200,14,163,227,236,235,172,74,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
