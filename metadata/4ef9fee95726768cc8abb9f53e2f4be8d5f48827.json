But what if you had the know-how to give (or receive) a massage at home that was almost as good as one that you would receive from a professional?\r\nThatâ€™s where MASSAGE ANATOMY comes in. This detailed guide to massage provides you with everything you need give a massage in your home.\r\nThe massage demonstrated on the following pages is a basic Swedish massage. It incorporates a series of hand strokes, kneading movements, and â€œfrictionâ€ (more about that later) to work the muscles. Our massage is about relaxing tense muscles, improving the range of motion of joints, stress relief, and enhancing circulation.\r\nMASSAGE ANATOMY also offers you flexibility. When you donâ€™t have time for a full-body massage, you can pick and choose from the techniques to create a shorter massage. For instance, perhaps your spouse has come home from a long day on her feet. You could treat her to a foot massage using the instructions from this book. Or you may choose to focus on the head and neck of a friend suffering from a tension headache.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nIntroduction\r\nBasics\r\n1 Upper Body: Back\r\nThe Back\r\nLower Back\r\n2 Lower Body: Back\r\nGlutes\r\nLegs\r\nFeet\r\n3 Lower Body: Front\r\nFeet\r\nFront of Legs\r\n4 Upper Body: Front\r\nAbs &amp; Chest\r\nArms &amp; Shoulders\r\nHands\r\n5 The Head\r\nNeck\r\nFace\r\nHead\r\nTargeted Massages\r\nFind Out More\r\nCredits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ef9fee95726768cc8abb9f53e2f4be8d5f48827","amp;dn":"Massage+Anatomy+-+A+Comprehensive+Guide+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ef9fee95726768cc8abb9f53e2f4be8d5f48827","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,249,254,233,87,38,118,140,200,171,185,245,62,47,75,232,213,244,136,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
