Weller wanted to incorporate more elements of soul, R&amp;B, and jazz into his songwriting, which is something he felt his punk-oriented bandmates were incapable of performing. In order to pursue this musical direction, he teamed up in 1983 with keyboardist Mick Talbot, a former member of the mod revival band the Merton Parkas. Together, Weller and Talbot became the Style Council -- other musicians were added according to what kind of music the duo were performing. With the Style Council, the underlying intellectual pretensions that ran throughout Weller's music came to the forefront.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tPolydor\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Speak Like A Child\n02.Money-Go-Round Parts 1 &amp; 2\n03.Long Hot Summer\n04.A Solid Bond In Your Heart\n05.My Ever Changing Moods\n06.You're The Best Thing\n07.The Big Boss Groove\n08.Shout To The Top\n09.Walls Come Tumbling Down\n10.Come To Milton Keynes\n11.The Lodgers\n12.Have You Ever Had It Blue\n13.It Didn't Matter\n14.Waiting\n15.Wanted\n16.Life At A Top Peoples Health Farm\n17.How She Threw It All Away\n18.Promised Land\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                    ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f0d8232f02a94190422d321e292434602ae59ef","amp;dn":"The+Style+Council+-+Greatest+Hits+%282000%29+MP3+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f0d8232f02a94190422d321e292434602ae59ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,13,130,50,240,42,148,25,4,34,211,33,226,146,67,70,2,174,89,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
