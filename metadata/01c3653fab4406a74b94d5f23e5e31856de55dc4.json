(Billy Altman, Amazon)\n\n\n\nFrom the opening, hard-edged chords of &quot;She Has Funny Cars,&quot; it's apparent that Surrealistic Pillow, Jefferson Airplane's sophomore effort, is a far more spiky beast than the band's debut. It became not only San Francisco's soundtrack to the Summer Of Love, but all of America's. It spawned two Top Ten classics (&quot;Somebody To Love&quot; and &quot;White Rabbit&quot;) and established the Airplane as one of the main pop voices of the cultural revolution.\n\nSome of the newfound dynamism can be attributed to personnel changes. Singer-keyboardist Grace Slick, who joined the Airplane following a stint in the mildly successful Great Society, had a unique artistic gleam her predecessor, Signe Anderson, never possessed--both of the aforementioned hits were songs she'd written for her former band. And new drummer Spencer Dryden could make the music shake with heretofore-unheard polyrhythms, or walk a straight line with militaristic precision. Surrealistic Pillow's other strengths lay in the band's boldly diverse sound. Effortlessly gliding from twisted Motown (the electrified &quot;3/5 Of A Mile In 10 Seconds&quot;), to Dylanesque rock (Balin's &quot;Plastic Fantastic Lover&quot;) to an acoustic, psychedelic bluegrass instrumental (Kaukonen's &quot;Embryonic Journey&quot;), the Airplane proved themselves able to at once interpret the cultural tide and make it radio-friendly.\n\nTracklist:\n1.
