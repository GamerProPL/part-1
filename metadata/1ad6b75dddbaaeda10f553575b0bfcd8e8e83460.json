It is a stand alone program which looks for unknown and suspicious files, giving each of them a score using a patent pending technique. Unknown and suspicious files are automatically identified by online identification servers. This means no software on your system.\n\nHitman Pro does not scan your system alphabetically, it scans disk objects in physical order on your disk. This also significantly lowers the stress on your hardware. Furthermore, a lot of analysis tasks are performed concurrently by deploying tasks multi-threaded. And if you own a multi-core processor, this software can efficiently use the extra cores in order to increase enumeration speed even more.\n\nHitman Pro doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need to scan every file on your system. Why not? We have profiled standard systems so it knows which files are good. Also, Hitman actually focuses on finding objects that donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t behave like good software. Software that does not follow trustworthy guidelines will automatically receive a higher score than software that is uninstallable by the user, identifyable, digitally signed, unencrypted, uncompressed, visible and accessible.\n\nThe engine also tries to find out where the software came from, how it got on your system and what other people say about it on the internet. That probably sounds common sense or seem impossible to some of you but we are certain you will be astonished on how well the scoring system works.\n\nTo remove malicious software the developers have also built a special removal engine that is capable of removing the toughest threats. A native NT application is capable of removing resilient threats before Windows starts. And of course, including corresponding references like registry keys and shortcuts. All without the need of updates and signatures.\n\n\nWhat's New in This Release:\n-Fixed a crash while scanning miniport drivers on FAT32 filesystems.\n-Updated SQLite library.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAnother Quality Torrent Courtesy of Hyperdrive25.
