The book explores from scratch the algorithms and representations needed for building intelligent systems. The textbook follows a bottom-up approach exploring the basic strategies - starting with search based methods &amp; then moving on to knowledge based methods - needed for problem solving and focuses primarily on the intelligence part. The only background required to comprehend the book is familiarity with programming. Easy explanations for the concepts bolstered with illuminative illustrations make the book an essential reading for the budding artificial intelligence students, seasoned practitioners and researchers; all alike","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36cb14810808238554a04f2bafb1f6366fcff472","amp;dn":"A+First+Course+in+Artificial+Intelligence+-+Deepak+Khemani","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36cb14810808238554a04f2bafb1f6366fcff472","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,203,20,129,8,8,35,133,84,160,79,43,175,177,246,54,111,207,244,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
