Developed principally by British games developer Playground Games in association with Turn 10 Studios, the game is a part of Turn 10's long-running Forza Motorsport franchise, but is considered more of a spin-off instead of the next true member of the series\n\nForza Horizon is an open-road game based around a fictitious festival called the Horizon, set in Colorado, USA. The game incorporates many different gameplay aspects from previous Forza Motorsport titles, like the large variety of cars, realistic physics and high definition graphics. The aim is to progress through the game by means of obtaining &quot;Wristbands&quot; by driving fast, destroying property, winning races and other driving antics. Horizon is set to feature the physics of Forza Motorsport 4, which have been optimised to work on the 65 variants of terrain said to be present in the game. Players can drive off-road in select areas, while others are limited by guardrails or other means.[3]\nMultiple race types are included, from drift to rally and point-to-point races. AI traffic will be present on the roads under single player, which provides a new dynamic to the Forza racing system.[3] Players may also challenge other Horizon festival drivers they encounter in a one-on-one race to a given location. The location is random each time, and the AI have the ability to use shortcuts to their advantage.[4] Races will take place at different times throughout the day/night cycle included in the game, including night races.[3] A skill system is implemented in the game; players earn street cred during races by driving aggressively. Acts such as drifting, jumping over obstacles and getting a car on two wheels all contribute to the cred. These can be chained together in a combo, which in turn affects the money players are paid at the end of a given race.[5] Cred also affects a player's popularity level in the game. As a player's popularity increases new special events are unlocked, such as races against helicopters and planes.[5]\nSpeed traps are present in the game, and players can challenge each other for the top speed in a given area. Cameras record player times, which can then be shared among rivals. Those rivals can then attempt to beat the shared time.[5] A photography mode is also included.[3] In addition to races, players can search for barn find carsÃ¢â‚¬â€cars that have been stored away for long periods of timeÃ¢â‚¬â€have them restored, and add them to their car collection.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f48aeba506dd91ca396ac0bb34e528dbefb95e38","amp;dn":"Forza+Horizon+PT-BR+RF+XGD3+XBOX360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f48aeba506dd91ca396ac0bb34e528dbefb95e38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,138,235,165,6,221,145,202,57,106,192,187,52,229,40,219,239,185,94,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
