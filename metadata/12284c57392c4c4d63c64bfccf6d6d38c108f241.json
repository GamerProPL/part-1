Over 1,000 annotated color figures help explain circuit operation or emphasize critical components and input/output criteria. Throughout the text, the author employs a step-by-step approach that takes students from theory to example to application of the concepts. Over all nine editions, Kleitz has consistently sought out student feedback, along with his own experience of teaching the course in-class and on-line, to improve each new edition. \n\nBiography\nProfessor Kleitz completed his Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering Technology (BSET)from the Rochester Institute of Technology and his Masters Degree in Engineering (M-Eng) from Cornell University. For several years Professor Kleitz worked as an electrical engineer at New York State Electric and Gas where he developed electric power distribution strategies and automation. \nAfter NYSEG he started the Electrical Engineering Technology Program at TC3 and has been the program chair since. He has also conducted hundreds of training workshops to local manufacturers in the area of industrial electronics and automated control.\nResearch:\nProfessor Kleitz has been awarded two New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) grants related to energy management. For these grants he completed research on automated data acquisition and control of energy management systems.\nAwards:\nProfessor Kleitz was the 2002 recipient of the State University of New York Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Scholarship and Creative Activities.\nKey published works:\nProfessor Kleitz has been publishing textbooks with Prentice-Hall since 1986. He has written five digital electronics and microprocessor textbooks spanning 16 editions. His newest textbook, Digital Electronics: A Practical Approach with VHDL, Ninth edition has become a top seller worldwide.\nSpecial projects: \nBesides electronics, Bill's key interests involve skiing, mountain biking and camping (anything to do with the outdoors in any weather). Professor Kleitz has recently embarked on a project to YouTube everything he knows about Digital Electronics and Microprocessors. There are several hundred podcasts completed and the entire set will cover hundreds of lectures and tutorials in the field. \nTo view Professor Kleitz's Podcast Lectures on Digital Electronics visit:\n\nFor information about Professor Kleitz's 9th edition textbook visit: www.pearsonhighered.com/kleitz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12284c57392c4c4d63c64bfccf6d6d38c108f241","amp;dn":"Digital+Electronics+-+A+Practical+Approach+With+VHDL+9th+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12284c57392c4c4d63c64bfccf6d6d38c108f241","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,40,76,87,57,44,76,77,99,198,75,252,207,109,109,56,193,8,242,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
