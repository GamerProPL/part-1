(Oof. Here we go again.) I'm a mercenary with an\naccelerated healing factor. I've been described as unstable, which is just\nplain coo-coo. (Wait, do sane people say coo-coo?) I'm gonna battle for\nthe safety of humans and mutants. (And even mumans.) Be prepared for just\nabout anything. (Holla!)\n\nFeatures:\n\n* I made sure to capture all my good sides, so I made my game a\nthird-person action-shooter. (Yep, you get to look at my heinie.)\n* Keep a look out cuz some of my X-Men pals (Whoa, what pals?!) are making\nan appearance. (Hope you don't mind picking hair out of your tacos.)\n* I'm really good at killing, so I made it a blast stringing together\ncombos, and totally eviscerating my enemies. (Ev-is-cer-a-ting!)\n* I brought my skills and a buttload of my favorite things. Katanas\n(check), guns (bang!) explosives (boom), duct tape (quack) and of\ncourse, yours truly - ME!
