At the time of my illness, I had never heard of Signor Luigi Serafini or seen any of his works. During my sickness I had quite a few hallucinatory dreams, some of them were freakish and grotesque and some rather tranquil and spiritually comforting.     \n\nOne dream that occurred repeatedly involved what looked like a silhouette of irregular wooden lattice work, like twigs and branches tied together, but just the silhouette of them.  In the dark portions of the silhouettes were the images of some form of text.  It was sort of squiggly, heavily dotted, cursive style text.  It reminded me of Arabic, Syriac, or possibly one of Kingsley ReadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s modernized alphabets, like the Shavian or Quickscript, if it had been written in more of a continuous cursive style. It reminded me of these scripts, but it wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t any of them.  \n\n***This next part is going to sound crazy, but please stick with me.*** \n\nLast December, I was visiting a friend outside Boston.   She showed me a fancy book that she had.  She said it was very expensive, very odd, and that I would probably enjoy it.  The moment I opened the book I was astonished, because the book was filled with what looked like the text from the dream that I had during my illness. Of course the book was the Codex Seraphinianus. \n\nFor the next two days I was not able to sleep.  I just sat in various places around her house, petting cats and reading through the book.  I did eat and drink some coffee and wine, but I stayed focused on the book. By the end of the first night, I began taking notes about the book.  On the second day, I felt as though I was truly starting to understand what some of the text meant. \n\nI would first meditate on Signor SerafiniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s amazing illustrations until I reached a buoyant almost trancelike state. I would visually scan the text and then slowly blur my eyes, similar to the way you view the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMagic EyeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ type autostereograms. I would try not to stare directly at the text, but to look off to one side ever so slightly or to keep my vision blurred enough so that the text was just teetering at the brink of my perception.  It was similar to reentering the state of consciousness that I was in during my bought with meningitis, and when I got there the meaning of the text would flood in. Sometimes I was able to capture the meaning of full sentences, verbatim and sometimes only the general sense of what they were conveying.  Every time, I stopped to write down what I understood, my grip on the book was broken and I would have to start over again. By the end of that second day, I had deciphered the first chapter of the book. I slept for the next 24 hours and then through most of the following two days. \n\nMy progress has been much slower since those first two days, but it has been steady.  As of the first of April, 2009 I have deciphered the first three chapters of the book. This book has changed my life, and I believe it will eventually change the human race for the better. By the way, it's much more then just an encyclopedia. There is also a guide-book like quality to it with elements of philosophy, science, alchemy, enlightenment and an almost incomprehensible, weird molecular-spiritual evolution. Plus, it's quite funny.\n\nWork has begun at www.CodexSeraphinianus.org\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThis torrent is an Adobe pdf file and individual jpg image files of the book.\n\nFor anyone not familiar with it, The Codex Seraphinianus is a book written and illustrated by the Italian artist, architect and industrial designer Luigi Serafini during thirty months, from 1976 to 1978.[1] The book is approximately 360 pages long (depending on edition), and appears to be a visual encyclopedia of an unknown world, written in one of its languages, a thus-far thought to be undeciphered alphabetic writing.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:456c20da125e317999fed344c3aefbae7f2c86d5","amp;dn":"codex+seraphinianus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"456c20da125e317999fed344c3aefbae7f2c86d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,108,32,218,18,94,49,121,153,254,211,68,195,174,251,174,127,44,134,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
