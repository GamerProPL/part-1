Whether or not the other wonders of Las Vegas--like buffets--will be included remains to be seen, but for now, we were assured that once you make your way to the strip, there will be a variety of ways to give up your hard-earned cash. At the Bethesda Gamers Day held in Las Vegas, Obsidian presented an hour-long demo of its upcoming role-playing game set in the dry and desolate Mojave Wasteland. Several members of the development team came from Black Isle Studios--the creators of Fallout and Fallout 2--so the game's story and setting will likely feel more familiar to those who had played the first two games. \n\nPersonal Notes:\n- Only tested with SKiDROW release\n- Update 3 fixes crashes and improves framerate\n- DLC Looks to be working fine\n- This over from appdb for FO3: \n\nIf you have 2 or more cores, do the followingÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â  :-\n\n1) Open ~/My Games/FalloutNV/FALLOUT.INI\n2) Find bUseThreadedAI=0 and change it to bUseThreadedAI=1\n3) Add iNumHWThreads=2 after bUseThreadedAI=1\n4) Save file\n\n\nPort Info\nWineskin 2.0Beta 5 - Custom Wine 1.3.4-Engine\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\n- OS: Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard / Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard\n- CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo Processor\n- RAM: 2048 MB\n- Video: nVidia 8xxx Series or AMD 4xxx Series Video Card recommended\n- Apple's X11 must be installed\n- 7.51GB Hard Drive Space required\n\nFor full support with this wrapper please sign up at the PortingTeam Forums and post your comments/questions in the Fallout New Vegas thread found here: http://forum.portingteam.com/viewtopic.php?f=45&amp;t=6295\n\nKnown Issues:\nA slight drop in frame rate while in the Mojave Wasteland.\n\nSome textures may go missing throughout the run of the game and then reappear  upon restart.
