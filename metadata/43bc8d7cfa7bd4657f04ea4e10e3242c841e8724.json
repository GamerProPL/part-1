No more cars with non-rotating wheels, better textures and models for other's cars, greater view distance in the rear view, etc.\r\n- Fog effect and light beams support in the DirectX 6 (they were exclusive effects for the 3dfx Voodoo).\r\n- Portability. All system settings are loaded from the ini file. No more registry!\r\n- Compatibility. Most problems with modern Windows were fixed. New system settings were added.\r\n- Full support of multi-core processors. Original game could work correctly only on one core. This change dramatically improves performance of the nGlide and the dgVoodoo.\r\n- Alt+Tab support. You can safely minimize the game when nGlide or dgVoodoo renderer is used.\r\n- Built-in screenshoter. Just press Print Screen key, and a screenshot will be saved into the screenshots subdirectory in the JPG/PNG/BMP format.\r\n- Improved keyboard support in the menu. Now it is much more consistent. You can also use the Tab and Shift+Tab to switch between elements.\r\n- Optimizations. 10 times faster gameplay loading on modern systems. To skip loading animation just press any key.\r\n- Bugfixes. More than 200 changes at all!\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  What this bundle includes?\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAll original cars, inclusive:\r\n- All cars from the US Release.\r\n- 1998 Chevrolet Corvette Indy 500 Pace Car (from the Wal-Mart Edition).\r\n- Ford Falcon GT and HSV VG GTS (from the Australian Edition).\r\n- Ferrari 456 M GT, Spectre R42, Lister Storm, and Jaguar XKR (from the official NFS3 website).\r\n\r\nAll original language files:\r\n- English (in the base package nfs3_modern_base_eng.7z, mandatory).\r\n- French (voice sounds in the nfs3_modern_lang_fre.7z, optional).\r\n- German (voice sounds in the nfs3_modern_lang_ger.7z, optional).\r\n- Spanish (voice sounds in the nfs3_modern_lang_spa.7z, optional).\r\n- Italian (voice sounds in the nfs3_modern_lang_ita.7z, optional).\r\n- Swedish (no official voice sound files, only text have localized).\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  NFS3 Skype group chat\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFind other NFS3 fans for the network games in our Skype group chat! \nhttps://join.skype.com/xLP4dCluGg1s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43bc8d7cfa7bd4657f04ea4e10e3242c841e8724","amp;dn":"Need+For+Speed+III%3A+Hot+Pursuit+Modern+Bundle+v1.5.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43bc8d7cfa7bd4657f04ea4e10e3242c841e8724","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,188,141,124,250,123,212,101,127,4,234,78,16,227,36,44,132,30,135,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
