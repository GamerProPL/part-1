The band formed in 1990 and released their first record in 1991. Their name is derived from the Babylonian god Marduk, patron deity of Babylon.\n\nMarduk was formed by Morgan Steinmeyer HÃƒÂ¥kansson in order to form the &quot;most blasphemous band in the world&quot;. Their musical style was that of a straightforward death metal influenced take on black metal music, but as the years progressed their style and imagery became more of a fast and intense form of black metal.\n\nMarduk's predominant lyrical topics are Satanism, anti-Christianity, Biblical tales, death, Third Reich history, and World War II. The latter two are a later addition to their lyrical/conceptual themes, stemming from their 1999 release Panzer Division Marduk. Marduk have recorded further songs relating to those chapters of human history, such as &quot;The Hangman of Prague&quot; (moniker of Reinhard Heydrich - second in command of the SS - in his capacity as the de facto Reichsprotektor of Bohemia and Moravia), &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot;, &quot;Deathmarch&quot; and others.\n\n\n\nBand Members\n\nDaniel &quot;Mortuus&quot; RostÃƒÂ©n - vocals\nMorgan &quot;Evil&quot; Steinmeyer HÃƒÂ¥kansson - guitars\nFredrik Widigs - drums\nMagnus &quot;Devo&quot; Andersson - bass\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nDark Endless (1992)\nThose of the Unlight (1993)\nOpus Nocturne (1994)\nHeaven Shall Burn...
