He argued that human concepts and categories structure our view of the world and its laws, and that reason is the source of morality.  The free and proper exercise of reason by the individual was a theme both of the Age of Enlightenment, and of Kant's approaches to the various problems of philosophy.\n\nHis major work, the CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON (1781), aimed to bring reason together with experience and to move beyond what he took to be failures of traditional philosophy and metaphysics.  He published other important works on ethics, religion, law, aesthetics, astronomy, and history, including the CRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON (1788), the METAPHYSICS OF MORALS (1797), dealing with ethics, and the CRITIQUE OF JUDGMENT (1790), which examines aesthetics and teleology.  All these works and many more are included in this collection.\n\nKant's ideas influenced many thinkers in Germany during his lifetime, and he moved philosophy beyond the debate between the rationalists and empiricists.  His thought continues to have a major influence in contemporary thought, especially in fields such as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics.\n\n\nAll the following books are in PDF format (of varying quality):\n\n* ANTHROPOLOGY FROM A PRAGMATIC POINT OF VIEW (Cambridge University Press, 2006).
