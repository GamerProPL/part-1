From acts of terror to mass shootings, and from the unseen (and sometimes virtual) matrix of everyday crime, danger is no longer confined to dark alleys or unstable regions. Potentially life-threatening circumstances can arise anywhere, anytime, and Clint Emersonâ€”former Navy SEALâ€”wants you to be prepared.\r\n100 Deadly Skills contains proven self-defense skills, evasion tactics, and immobilizing maneuversâ€”modified from the world of black opsâ€”to help you take action in numerous â€œworst caseâ€ scenarios from escaping a locked trunk, to making an improvised Taser, to tricking facial recognition software. With easy-to-understand instructions and illustrations, Emerson outlines in detail many life-saving strategies and teaches you how to think and act like a member of the special forces.\r\nThis complete course in survival teaches you how to prevent tracking, evade a kidnapping, elude an active shooter, rappel down the side of a building, immobilize a bad guy, protect yourself against cyber-criminals, and much moreâ€”all using low-tech to â€œno-techâ€ methods. Clear, detailed, and presented in an easy-to-understand and execute format, 100 Deadly Skills is an invaluable resource. Because letâ€™s face it, when danger is imminent, you donâ€™t have time for complicated instructions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17c1767531a36c07d5bdfc6f02b7f199484e45fd","amp;dn":"100+Deadly+Skills+by+Clint+Emerson+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17c1767531a36c07d5bdfc6f02b7f199484e45fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,193,118,117,49,163,108,7,213,189,252,111,2,183,241,153,72,78,69,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
