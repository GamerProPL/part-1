How religion poisons everything\nPublication Date: May 1, 2007\nPublisher: Twelve Books\nFile format: Pdf, Epub, Mobi\n\nDescription\n\nIn the tradition of Bertrand Russell's Why I Am Not a Christian and Sam Harris's recent bestseller, The End of Faith, Christopher Hitchens makes the ultimate case against religion. With a close and erudite reading of the major religious texts, he documents the ways in which religion is a man-made wish, a cause of dangerous sexual repression, and a distortion of our origins in the cosmos. With eloquent clarity, Hitchens frames the argument for a more secular life based on science and reason, in which hell is replaced by the Hubble Telescope's awesome view of the universe, and Moses and the burning bush give way to the beauty and symmetry of the double helix.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nChristopher Hitchens (1949-2011) was the author of Letters to a Young Contrarian, and the bestseller No One Left to Lie To: The Values of the Worst Family. A regular contributor to Vanity Fair, The Atlantic Monthly and Slate, Hitchens also wrote for The Weekly Standard, The National Review, and The Independent, and appeared on The Daily Show, Charlie Rose, The Chris Matthew's Show, Real Time with Bill Maher, and C-Span's Washington Journal. He was named one of the world's &quot;Top 100 Public Intellectuals&quot; by Foreign Policy and Britain's Prospect.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85d8842a5e03d21d4bfcb919719f7e7a5aa42240","amp;dn":"Christopher+Hitchens+-+God+Is+Not+Great+%5BPdf+Epub+Mobi+-+Eng%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85d8842a5e03d21d4bfcb919719f7e7a5aa42240","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,216,132,42,94,3,210,29,75,252,185,25,113,159,126,122,90,164,34,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
