Shetty, is an atlas and textbook that combines nearly 400 illustrations and radiologic images highlighting key neuroanatomical concepts and clinical correlations with updated information that reflects our current understanding of the nervous system. It offers user-friendly coverage in three parts-an overview of the nervous system, regional neuroscience, and systemic neuroscience- that enable you to review complex neural structures and systems from different contexts. Online access to Student Consult- where you'll find the complete fully searchable contents of the book, videos of imaging sequences, links to relevant content in other Student Consult titles, and more- further enhances your study and helps to prepare you for exams.\nPresents nearly 400 exquisite Netter and Netter-style illustrations that highlight key neuroscience concepts and clinical correlations, providing you with a quick and memorable overview of anatomy, function, and clinical relevance.\nProvides concise text for fast, &quot;at-a-glanceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ guidance.\n\nFeatures a regional organization of the peripheral nervous system, spinal cord, brain stem and cerebellum, and forebrain...and a systemic organization of the sensory motor systems, motor systems (including cerebellum and basal ganglia), and limbic/hypothalmic/autonomic systems...that makes reference easier and more efficient.\nFeatures high-quality imaging-high-resolution MRI in coronal and axial (horizontal) planes and brain stem cross-sections-as well MR angiography and venography and classical arteriography-for an enhanced perspective of intricacies of the nervous system.\nPresents updated information and new figures that reflect the current understanding of the neural components and supportive tissue, regions, and systems of the brain, spinal cord, and periphery, to ensure that you have the latest knowledge. \nOffers schematic cross-sectional brain stem anatomy and axial and coronal brain anatomy-with side-by-side comparisons with labeled MRs-to better illustrate the correlation between neuroanatomy and neurology.\nProvides new 3D color pixelated imaging of commissural, association, and projection pathways of the brain.\nFeatures Clinical Notes boxes that emphasize the clinical application of fundamental neuroscience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f7166b3fa203a70158297ae097561209a98e487","amp;dn":"Netter%27s+Atlas+of+Neuroscience%2C+2E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f7166b3fa203a70158297ae097561209a98e487","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,113,102,179,250,32,58,112,21,130,151,174,9,117,97,32,154,152,228,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
