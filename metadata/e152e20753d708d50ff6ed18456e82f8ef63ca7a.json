In the distant future, Earth's natural resources have been depleted, and as an off-world prospector it's your job to travel to alien planets and scour them for valuable materials. These can be refined and shipped back to Earth in return for cash, or crafted into new components to augment your fleet. The rarest resources unlock the best equipment, so expand your territory and capture enemy bases, to secure your position on each planet","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e152e20753d708d50ff6ed18456e82f8ef63ca7a","amp;dn":"TerraTech+v0.5.9te","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e152e20753d708d50ff6ed18456e82f8ef63ca7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,82,226,7,83,215,8,213,15,246,237,24,69,110,130,248,239,99,202,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
