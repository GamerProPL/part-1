Sherry Argov's Why Men Love Bitches delivers a unique perspective as to why men are attracted to a strong woman who stands up for herself. With saucy detail on every page, this no-nonsense guide reveals why a strong woman is much more desirable than a &quot;yes woman&quot; who routinely sacrifices herself. The author provides compelling answers to the tough questions women often ask: Why are men so romantic in the beginning and why do they change? Why do men take nice girls for granted? Why does a man respect a woman when she stands up for herself? Full of advice, hilarious real-life relationship scenarios, &quot;she says/he thinks&quot; tables, and the author's unique &quot;Attraction Principles,&quot; Why Men Love Bitches gives you bottom-line answers. It helps you know who you are, stand your ground, and relate to men on a whole new level. Once you've discovered the feisty attitude men find so magnetic, you'll not only increase the romantic chemistry-you'll gain your man's love and respect with far less effort. \n\n\nEnjoy this great book!\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b1fdada0acb9c1827994e2a63a58b192a8e4a60","amp;dn":"Why+Men+Love+Bitches%3A+A+Woman%5C%27s+Guide+to+Holding+Her+Own+in+a+R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b1fdada0acb9c1827994e2a63a58b192a8e4a60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,31,218,218,10,203,156,24,39,153,78,42,99,165,139,25,42,142,74,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
