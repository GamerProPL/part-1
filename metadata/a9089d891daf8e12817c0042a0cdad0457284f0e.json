Clarke. Book read by Dick Hill.\r\n\r\n2001: A Space Odyssey is a 1968 science fiction novel by Arthur C. Clarke. It was developed concurrently with Stanley Kubrick's film version and published after the release of the film. Clarke and Kubrick worked on the book together, but eventually only Clarke ended up as the official author. The story is based in part on various short stories by Clarke, most notably &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (written in 1948 for a BBC competition, but first published in 1951 under the title &quot;Sentinel of Eternity&quot;).\r\n\r\nFrom the savannas of Africa at the dawn of mankind to the rings of Saturn as man ventures to the outer rim of our solar system, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a journey unlike any other. \r\n\r\nThe year is 2001, and cosmonauts uncover a mysterious monolith that has been buried on the Moon for at least three million years. To their astonishment, the monolith releases an equally mysterious pulse in the direction of Saturn after it is unearthed. Whether it is an alarm or some form of communication, the human race must know what the signal is and who it was intended for.\r\n\r\nThe Discovery and its crew, assisted by the highly advanced HAL 9000 computer system, sets out to investigate. But as the crew draws closer to their rendezvous with a mysterious and ancient alien civilization, they realize that the greatest dangers they face may come from within the spacecraft itself.\r\n\r\nClarke is widely revered as one of the most influential science fiction writers of the 20th century, esteemed alongside Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein, a trio known informally as the â€œBig Three.â€ He authored more than 100 novels, novellas, and short story collections and laid the groundwork for science fiction as we know it today. Combining scientific knowledge and visionary literary aptitude, Clarkeâ€™s work explored the implications of major scientific discoveries in inventive and mystical settings","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9089d891daf8e12817c0042a0cdad0457284f0e","amp;dn":"2001+A+Space+Odyssey+-+Audiobook+-+Unabridged+-+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9089d891daf8e12817c0042a0cdad0457284f0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,8,157,137,29,175,142,18,129,124,0,66,160,205,173,4,87,40,79,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
