For the sixteenth edition, every aspect of coverage has been reconsidered to reflect how publishing professionals work today. Though processes may change, the Manual continues to offer the clear, well-considered style and usage advice it has for more than a century.\nThe sixteenth edition offers expanded information on producing electronic publications, including web-based content and e-books. An updated appendix on production and digital technology demystifies the process of electronic workflow and offers a primer on the use of XML markup, and a revised glossary includes a host of terms associated with electronic as well as print publishing. The Chicago system of documentation has been streamlined and adapted for a variety of online and digital sources. Figures and tables are updated throughout the bookÃ¢â‚¬â€including a return to the ManualÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s popular hyphenation table and new, comprehensive listings of Unicode numbers for special characters.\n\nWith the wisdom of a hundred years of editorial practice and a wealth of industry expertise from both ChicagoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s staff and an advisory board of publishing professionals, The Chicago Manual of Style, 16th edition, is an invaluable resource in this rapidly changing world. If you work with wordsÃ¢â‚¬â€no matter what the delivery mediumÃ¢â‚¬â€this is the one reference you simply must have.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b2133435fcceb0ddbf792f511983a71f83797bc","amp;dn":"The+Chicago+Manual+of+Style+%2816th+Edition%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b2133435fcceb0ddbf792f511983a71f83797bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,33,51,67,95,204,235,13,219,247,146,245,17,152,58,113,248,55,151,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
