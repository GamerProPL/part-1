Other noteworthy tracks include the Paul McCartney classic, &quot;Live and Let Die,&quot; featuring classical piano superstar Lang Lang, and another Michael Jackson classic, 'They Don't Care About Us.' It was the 2CELLOS' version of Jackson's 'Smooth Criminal' that propelled them to stardom in 2011 when it went viral, garnering over 20 million YouTube views. &quot;Celloverse&quot; picks up where their debut album left off, with the guys focusing on their unique ability to re-invent current and classic rock and pop songs in a high-energy classical music format.\n\nSince 2011, 2CELLOS have been members and featured artists in Elton John s band. They were the first instrumentalists to be featured on the hit TV show &quot;Glee&quot; and have also appeared on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show,&quot; &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and &quot;The Bachelor Live Wedding Special.&quot; They will be touring the U.S. extensively starting in February, both on their own and with Elton John.\n\n\n\n                 2Cellos - In2ition (2013) Album MP3 @ 320 Kbps &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8039495/2Cellos_-_In2ition_(2013)_Album_MP3___320_Kbps&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8039495/2Cellos_-_In2ition_(2013)_Album_MP3___320_Kbps&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeecdfed9e537df5faeb5cb6054e86c8cf1059d2","amp;dn":"2Cellos+-+Celloverse+%5BJapanese+Edition%5D+%282015%29+Album+MP3+%40+320+K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeecdfed9e537df5faeb5cb6054e86c8cf1059d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,236,223,237,158,83,125,245,250,235,92,182,5,78,134,200,207,16,89,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
