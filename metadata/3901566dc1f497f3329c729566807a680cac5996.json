Yet over the past 170 years, this strange tale of misunderstanding, incompetence and compromise has become the founding myth of modern Chinese nationalism: the start of Chinaâ€™s heroic struggle against a Western conspiracy to destroy the country with opium and gunboat diplomacy.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the dramas of the war itself, Julia Lovell explores its causes and consequences and, through this larger narrative, interweaves the curious stories of opiumâ€™s promoters and attackers. The Opium War is both the story of Chinaâ€™s first conflict with the West and an analysis of the countryâ€™s contemporary self-image. It explores how Chinaâ€™s national myths mold its interactions with the outside world, how public memory is spun to serve the present; and how delusion and prejudice have bedeviled its relationship with the modern West","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3901566dc1f497f3329c729566807a680cac5996","amp;dn":"The+Opium+War%3A+Drugs%2C+Dreams+and+the+Making+of+China","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3901566dc1f497f3329c729566807a680cac5996","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,1,86,109,193,244,151,243,50,156,114,149,102,128,122,104,12,172,89,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
