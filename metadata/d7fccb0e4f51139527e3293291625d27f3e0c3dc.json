Being a free-spirited rebel can be adventurous and exciting but it can also mean a price has to be paid. Jaco paid the ultimate price with his life. Let's hope he found peace.\n\nTags have been edited in this compilation so that Disc 1 and Disc 2 show up under a single album cover.\n\n- Big Papi\n\n\n\nBy A. Davis\n\nThis anthology is long over due. Jaco Pastorious was and still is the greatest electric bass player these ears have ever heard. Bold, soulful, melodic and full of pure talent - he is the benchmark for modern bass players and his arranging skills cannot be overlooked in the big band arena. As a total musician, Jaco Pastorious was a Genius. He left us way too soon. Upfront, this anthology is a welcomed addition to my music collection. I have managed to purchase most of his recordings, including the imported &quot;Twins&quot; Japanese concert that was only partially released on the U.S. &quot;Invitation&quot; album. Jaco had a long list of valuable guest roles on other artists recordings that are well represented here.\n\nFrom the very start, Jaco had massive groove and technique. Listen to the bass lines on &quot;I can Dig It Baby&quot; - his signature sound is well defined on that 1974 track. His horn arranging skills are already in full bloom on the 1968 version of &quot;The Chicken&quot; - wow! The first disc is full of suprises that might have escaped many Jaco fans - if not captured here on Anthology. The beautiful &quot;Midwestern Nights Dream&quot; with Pat Metheny, was my first exposue to Jaco and his sound has been with me ever since. &quot;Foreign Fun&quot; is a lovely open-rump that allows Jaco, Mouzon and Mangelsdorff to stretch out and improvise within a tight groove. &quot;Nativity&quot; and &quot;Las Olas&quot; captures Jaco in the Airto and Flora Purim camp - laying down that fat Florida bass sound that only Pastorious could produce. The two Michel Colombier tracks &quot;Sunday&quot; and &quot;Layas&quot; are classic late 70's fusion workouts - bold, brassy and fun. The two Joni Mitchell tracks capture some of Jaco's most vibrant playing from the 1979 &quot;Mingus&quot; period. Exceptional contributions by Jaco always added a breath of fresh air to other artists' sound.\n\nDisc Two focuses on Jaco's solo recordings including the 1981 &quot;Word of Mouth&quot; and the incomplete &quot;Holiday For Twins&quot; and the 1982 Japanese concert &quot;Twins&quot;. This disc captured the essence of a masterful musician in full bloom. No matter the musical combinations, be it big band, trio or septet - Jaco made it work. His bass sound and tone were so unique that you would never mistaken him for another musician. He was an exception and gifted writer, arranger and bassist - and the 11 tracks captured here are jewels.\n\nWhat is suprising here is there is only one track represented from his career defining landmark 1976 &quot;Jaco Pastorious&quot; recording. The one track &quot;Continuum&quot; is a masterpiece. When you look at the track selection of Anthology, it is a glaring omission not to have an additional two or three tracks from Jaco's first solo release. So where is the third disc? Hopefully it will follow in a year or two and also include other side roles Jaco played with Al Dimeola, Randy Bernsen and Brian Melvin's Nightfood. I would also suggest a couple of tracks from Joni Mitchell's &quot;Hejira&quot; and &quot;Don Juan's Reckless Daughter&quot; recordings. If you don't have these two, Jaco is upfront and awesome in Joni's band.\n\nI am very pleased with the release of this perspective of Jaco's career - I am just left wanting more. His music will live forever. Thanks Rhino for pulling this double disc together. Now let's get cracking on volume II.
