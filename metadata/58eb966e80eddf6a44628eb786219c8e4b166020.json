It contains independent chapters aimed at various fields of application, enhanced by highly advanced graphics and results explained and supplemented with practical and theoretical exercises. The presentation of the book is meant to provide natural connections to classical fields of applications such as Fourier analysis or statistics. However, the book also covers modern areas of research, including new and seminal results in the area of functional analysis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58eb966e80eddf6a44628eb786219c8e4b166020","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+Modern+Analysis+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58eb966e80eddf6a44628eb786219c8e4b166020","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,235,150,110,128,237,223,106,68,98,142,183,134,33,156,142,75,22,96,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
