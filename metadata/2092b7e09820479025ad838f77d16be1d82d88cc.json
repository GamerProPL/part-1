Isbell had already honed his songwriting skills during his tenure with the Truckers, and he funneled those talents into Sirens of the Ditch, a bluesy, punk-infused lesson in guitar tones and Southern swagger that marked his solo debut in summer 2007. Backed by a new band dubbed the 400 Unit, Isbell took his songs on the road and soon began penning another album, which he recorded with the 400 Unit in 2008. Released the following year, Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit was another step away from his work with Drive-By Truckers, relying as much on sad, melancholic country ballads as the familiar Muscle Shoals sound. \n\n\nGenre................: Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Southeastern Records\nIncluded.............:Front Cover, auCDtect, Cue\n\n\n\n01.If It Takes A Lifetime\n02.24 Frames\n03.Flagship\n04.How To Forget\n05.Children Of Children\n06.The Life You Chose\n07.Something More Than Free\n08.Speed Trap Town\n09.Hudson Commodore\n10.Palmetto Rose\n11.To A Band That I Loved\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2092b7e09820479025ad838f77d16be1d82d88cc","amp;dn":"Jason+Isbell+-+Something+More+Than+Free+%282015%29+FLAC+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2092b7e09820479025ad838f77d16be1d82d88cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,146,183,224,152,32,71,144,37,173,131,143,119,209,107,225,216,45,136,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
