Had big problems finding this myself, so i thought i add it here. I have removed the password protected rar file from the original share (I hate those assholes doing that). I have also tested it under win7 and it is currently working fine.\n\nIncluding hotfix 16!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe licens manager hack gives you access to everything in the cadence SPB package.\n\nsee www.cadence.com/ for more info\n\n\n\n1. Install (License Manager) skipping license installation.\n\n 2. Install program (Cadence SPB 16.6).\n\n 3. Copy entire contents of folder &quot;AspirinCadenceLicenseManager&quot; to &quot;C:CadenceLicenseManager&quot; overwriting existing files. (If copying stops on file in use, stop &quot;Cadence License Manager&quot; service in computer management/services)\n\n 4. Copy entire contents of folder &quot;AspirinCadenceSPB_16.6tools&quot; to C:CadenceSPB_16.6tools&quot;. Locate and run with administrative rights the &quot;Tools.cmd&quot; script in destination folder. \n The script runs from 1 to 5 minutes depending on the speed of your computer.\n\n 5. In folder &quot;AspirinCadenceLicGen&quot;, use a text editor to open file &quot;src.lic&quot;. \n Change &quot;this-host name&quot; to the real name of your computer. \n Save the file.\n\n 6. In folder &quot;AspirinCadenceLicGen&quot;, find and run script &quot;LicGen.cmd&quot;. This will generate a license file &quot;license.lic&quot;.\n\n 7. Start the license server configuration program: Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Cadence -&gt; License Manager -&gt; License Server Configuration Utility. Specify the &quot;license.lic&quot; file as generated in the previous step. Click Next. You should see message indicating the successful startup of the license server.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5dbd8baef541cc540e9ecd4d00ede3907648dcf","amp;dn":"Cadence+Orcad+Allegro+16.6+%2B+hotfix+16","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5dbd8baef541cc540e9ecd4d00ede3907648dcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,219,216,186,239,84,28,197,64,233,236,212,208,14,222,57,7,100,141,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
