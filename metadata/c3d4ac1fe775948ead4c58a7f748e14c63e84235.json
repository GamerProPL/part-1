But after decades of vicious infighting and partisan gridlock in the New Republic Senate, that hope seems like a distant memory.\r\n\r\nNow a respected senator, Leia must grapple with the dangers that threaten to cripple the fledgling democracyâ€”from both within and without. Underworld kingpins, treacherous politicians, and Imperial loyalists are sowing chaos in the galaxy. Desperate to take action, senators are calling for the election of a First Senator. It is their hope that this influential post will bring strong leadership to a divided galaxy.\r\n\r\nAs the daughter of Darth Vader, Leia faces with distrust the prospect of any one person holding such a powerful positionâ€”even when supporters suggest Leia herself for the job. But a new enemy may make this path Leiaâ€™s only option. For at the edges of the galaxy, a mysterious threat is growing. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by January LaVoy\r\nFormat: MP3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3d4ac1fe775948ead4c58a7f748e14c63e84235","amp;dn":"Claudia+Gray+-+Bloodline+%28Star+Wars%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3d4ac1fe775948ead4c58a7f748e14c63e84235","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,212,172,31,231,117,148,142,173,76,88,167,247,72,225,76,99,232,66,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
