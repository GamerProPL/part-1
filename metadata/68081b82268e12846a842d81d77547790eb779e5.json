He works out of a customized bulletproof van, complete with Wi-Fi, a bar, a small fridge, fine leather chairs, a hidden gun compartment, and a heavily armed driver. He has no firm, no partners, no associates, and only one employee, his driver, whoâ€™s also his bodyguard, law clerk, confidant, and golf caddy. He lives alone in a small but extremely safe penthouse apartment, and his primary piece of furniture is a vintage pool table. He drinks small-batch bourbon and carries a gun.\r\n\r\nSebastian defends people other lawyers wonâ€™t go near: a drug-addled, tattooed kid rumored to be in a satanic cult, who is accused of molesting and murdering two little girls; a vicious crime lord on death row; a homeowner arrested for shooting at a SWAT team that mistakenly invaded his house. Why these clients? Because he believes everyone is entitled to a fair trial, even if he, Sebastian, has to cheat to secure one. He hates injustice, doesnâ€™t like insurance companies, banks, or big corporations; he distrusts all levels of government and laughs at the justice systemâ€™s notions of ethical behavior.\r\n\r\nSebastian Rudd is one of John Grishamâ€™s most colorful, outrageous, and vividly drawn characters yet. Gritty, witty, and impossible to put down, Rogue Lawyer showcases the master of the legal thriller at his very best","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68081b82268e12846a842d81d77547790eb779e5","amp;dn":"Rogue+Lawyer+-+John+Grisham","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68081b82268e12846a842d81d77547790eb779e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,8,27,130,38,142,18,132,106,132,45,129,215,117,71,121,14,183,121,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
