New topics include digital interfacing and control of drives, direct torque control of induction motors and current-fed operation in DC drives. The material on brushless servomotors has also been expanded.\n\nAustin HughesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ approach, using a minimum of maths, has established Electric Motors and Drives as a leading guide for electrical engineers and mechanical engineers, and the key to a complex subject for a wider readership, including technicians, managers and students.\n\n* Acquire knowledge of and understanding of the capabilities and limitations of motors and drives without struggling through unnecessary maths and theory\n* Updated material on the latest and most widely-used modern motors and drives, including brushless servomotors\n* New edition includes additional diagrams and worked examples throughout","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17ebeb5179383af6ae522063e9393e7920f4bd52","amp;dn":"Electric+Motors+and+Drives%3A+Fundamentals%2C+Types+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17ebeb5179383af6ae522063e9393e7920f4bd52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,235,235,81,121,56,58,246,174,82,32,99,233,57,62,121,32,244,189,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
