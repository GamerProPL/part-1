The band's line-up includes founding member Josh Homme (lead vocals, guitar), alongside longtime members Troy Van Leeuwen (guitar, lap steel, backing vocals), Dave Grohl (drums, percussion), Michael Shuman (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Dean Fertita (keyboards, guitar, percussion, backing vocals).\nFormed after the dissolution of Homme's previous band, Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age developed a style of riff-oriented, heavy rock music. Their sound has since evolved to incorporate a variety of different styles and influences, including working with ZZ Top member Billy Gibbons and steady contributor Mark Lanegan.\n\nAlbums:\n\nQueens of the Stone Age (1998)\nRated R (2000)\nSongs for the Deaf (2002)\nLullabies to Paralyze (2005)\nEra Vulgaris (2007)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57ff1a944e6eae7a9a3a18d0406bacc99bcaea8e","amp;dn":"Queens+Of+The+Stone+Age+-+Studio+Discography+1998+-+2007+%28320kbp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57ff1a944e6eae7a9a3a18d0406bacc99bcaea8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,255,26,148,78,110,174,122,154,58,24,208,64,107,172,201,155,202,234,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
