Although he based his work on a long tradition of biographical writing, Vasari infused these literary portraits with a decidedly modern form of critical judgment. The result is a work that remains to this day the cornerstone of art historical scholarship.\r\n\r\nSpanning the period from the thirteenth century to Vasariâ€™s own time, the Lives opens a window on the greatest personalities of the period, including Giotto, Brunelleschi, Mantegna, Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Titian. This Modern Library edition, abridged from the original text with notes drawn from earlier commentaries, as well as current research, reminds us why The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects is indispensable to any student interested in Renaissance art","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c90f2c90d8a5e5df15457988a031a763f01ae78","amp;dn":"The+Lives+o%2Ft+Most+Excellent+Painters%2C+Sculptors+and+Architects","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c90f2c90d8a5e5df15457988a031a763f01ae78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,144,242,201,13,138,94,93,241,84,87,152,138,3,26,118,63,1,174,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
