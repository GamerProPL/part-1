It includes the currently leaked album, The Blackest Beautiful.\nNone of the content is my own, I've simply created an all-in-one collection of the albums I've obtained online, one of which had to be converted from .m4a to .mp3\n\nAlbum list:\nExhaustion, Saltwater, And Everything In Between (2004)\nSpeak Like You Talk (2005)\nFake History (Reissue) (2010-2011)\nThe Blackest Beautiful (2013)\n\nNote:\nThis is my first ever torrent upload. If you'd like to request something that you know is available in stores but is difficult to find online, I'll consider purchasing, ripping, and uploading.\n\n\nBear in mind, the intention behind this upload is to spread the great music that is Letlive. in the hopes that it will motivate people to show support (it's understandable to not want to pay for the songs, so I always recommend buying merchandise or going to shows!)\nIf you enjoy the music, please support the artists!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:987e0a8149b1ed7c6b6aab708e62dc3a5de80550","amp;dn":"Letlive+Complete+Discography+%282004-2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"987e0a8149b1ed7c6b6aab708e62dc3a5de80550","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,126,10,129,73,177,237,124,107,106,171,112,142,98,220,58,93,232,5,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
