It was particularly popular between 1961 and 1966, has subsequently been revived and was highly influential on subsequent rock music. It has two major forms: largely instrumental surf rock, with an electric guitar or saxophone playing the main melody, pioneered by acts such as Dick Dale and the Del-Tones, and vocal surf pop, including both surf ballads and dance music, often with strong harmonies that are most associated with The Beach Boys. Many notable surf bands have been equally noted for both surf instrumental and surf pop music, so surf music is generally considered as a single genre despite the variety of these styles.[6] During the later stages of the surf music craze, many groups started to leave surfing behind and write songs about cars and girls; this was later known as hot rod rock. Surf music is often referred to as simply surf rock, even though the genre has many forms. \n\nDuring the mid- to late 1990s, surf rock experienced a revival with surf acts, including Dick Dale recording once more, partly due to the popularity of the movie Pulp Fiction (1994), which used Dale's &quot;Misirlou&quot; and other surf rock songs in the soundtrack. New surf bands were formed, including Man or Astro-man, The Mermen and Los Straitjackets.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38aa15efdb78b64bce4c8352bb2f80a94c2abaec","amp;dn":"100+Greatest+Surf+Rock+Songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38aa15efdb78b64bce4c8352bb2f80a94c2abaec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,170,21,239,219,120,182,75,206,76,131,82,187,47,128,169,76,42,186,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
