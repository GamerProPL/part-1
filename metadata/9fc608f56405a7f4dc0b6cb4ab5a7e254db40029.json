Led by guitarist Kevin Shields, the group released several EPs in the mid-'80s before recording the era-defining Isn't Anything in 1988, a record that merged lilting, ethereal melodies of the Cocteau Twins with crushingly loud, shimmering distortion. Though My Bloody Valentine rejected rock &amp; roll conventions, they didn't subscribe to the precious tendencies of anti-rock art-pop bands. Instead, they rode crashing waves of white noise to unpredictable conclusions, particularly since their noise wasn't paralyzing like the typical avant-garde noise rock band: it was translucent, glimmering, and beautiful. Shields was a perfectionist, especially when it came to recording, as much of My Bloody Valentine's sound was conceived within the studio itself. Nevertheless, the band was known as a formidable live act, even though they rarely moved, or even looked at the audience, while they were on-stage. Their notorious lack of movement was branded &quot;shoegazing&quot; by the British music press, and soon there were legions of other shoegazers -- Ride, Lush, the Boo Radleys, Chapterhouse, Slowdive -- that, along with the rolling dance-influenced Madchester scene, dominated British indie rock of the late '80s and early '90s. As shoegazing reached its peak in 1991, My Bloody Valentine released Loveless, which broke new sonic ground and was hailed as a masterpiece. Though the band was poised for a popular breakthrough, it disappeared into the studio and didn't emerge over the next five years, leaving behind a legacy that proved profoundly influential in the direction of '90s alternative rock.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\nDisc 1 - Original Version Remastered\n\n\n01.Only Shallow\n02.Loomer\n03.Touched\n04.To Here Knows When\n05.When You Sleep\n06.I Only Said\n07.Come In Alone\n08.Sometimes\n09.Blown A Wish\n10.What You Want\n11.Soon\n\n\nDisc 2 - New Version Remastered From Analog Tapes\n\n\n01.Only Shallow (Alternate Version)\n02.Loomer (Alternate Version)\n03.Touched (Alternate Version)\n04.To Here Knows When (Alternate Version)\n05.When You Sleep (Alternate Version)\n06.I Only Said (Alternate Version)\n07.Come In Alone (Alternate Version)\n08.Sometimes (Alternate Version)\n09.Blown A Wish (Alternate Version)\n10.What You Want (Alternate Version)\n11.Soon (Alternate Version)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
