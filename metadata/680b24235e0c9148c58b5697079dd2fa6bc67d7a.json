He is hired by the mysterious Mr. Wednesday to act as an escort and bodyguard, and travels across America visiting Wednesday&amp;#039;s colleagues and acquaintances. Gradually, it is revealed that Wednesday is an incarnation of Odin the All-Father (the word Wednesday is derived from &quot;Odin&amp;#039;s (Woden&amp;#039;s) day&quot;). Wednesday is recruiting American manifestations of the Old Gods of ancient mythology, whose powers have waned as their believers have decreased in number, to participate in an epic battle against the New American Gods, manifestations of modern life and technology (e.g. the internet, media, &amp; modern means of transport).\n\nPlease seed 1:1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:680b24235e0c9148c58b5697079dd2fa6bc67d7a","amp;dn":"Neil+Gaiman+-+American+Gods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"680b24235e0c9148c58b5697079dd2fa6bc67d7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,11,36,35,94,12,145,72,197,139,86,151,7,157,210,250,107,198,125,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
