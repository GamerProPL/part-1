It is difficult to think about law, politics, religion, public policy, intimate relationships, moralityâ€”as well as feelings of remorse or personal achievementâ€”without first imagining that every person is the true source of his or her thoughts and actions. And yet the facts tell us that free will is an illusion. \r\n\r\nIn this enlightening book, Sam Harris argues that this truth about the human mind does not undermine morality or diminish the importance of social and political freedom, but it can and should change the way we think about some of the most important questions in life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbb3be1970727bd8fff6dd66dc8e5268f3a6ad6c","amp;dn":"Sam+Harris+-+Free+Will","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbb3be1970727bd8fff6dd66dc8e5268f3a6ad6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,179,190,25,112,114,123,216,255,246,221,102,220,142,82,104,243,166,173,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
