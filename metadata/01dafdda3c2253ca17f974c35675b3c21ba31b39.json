The watchmaker belongs to the 18th-century theologian William Paley, who argued that just as a watch is too complicated and functional to have sprung into existence by accident, so too must all living things, with their far greater complexity, be purposefully designed. Charles Darwin's brilliant discovery challenged the creationist arguments; but only Richard Dawkins could have written this elegant riposte. Natural selection - the unconscious, automatic, blind, yet essentially nonrandom process Darwin discovered - is the blind watchmaker in nature.\n\nUnabridged.\nRead by Richard Dawkins and Lalla Ward.\n\n\n---------------------------------\nVisit us for this and more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n---------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01dafdda3c2253ca17f974c35675b3c21ba31b39","amp;dn":"The+Blind+Watchmaker+-+Richard+Dawkins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01dafdda3c2253ca17f974c35675b3c21ba31b39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,218,253,218,60,34,83,202,23,249,116,195,86,117,179,194,27,163,27,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
