Especially in large prints hung on a wall, the difference between Blow Up and Photoshop is astounding. Version 3 makes pictures even sharper without computer artifacts.\n\nIf you understand PhotoshopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s resize command then you already know how to use Blow Up. Our large library of standard paper sizes makes it even easier. With Lightroom and CMYK support, Blow Up fits into a professional workflow.\n\nBokeh.2.0.1.494\n\nBokeh 2 provides a wide range of creative focus effects and accurate lens simulation in a simple interface. Photographers use Bokeh to draw attention to their subject by manipulating focus, vignette, and depth of field. \n\nBokeh gives you the visual language of specialized lenses without the expense or hassle. Just drop a focus region over your subject and choose a preset or easily craft your own look.\n\nBokeh 2 is dramatically faster, has multiple focus regions, motion blur, and a more flexible vignette.\n\nExposure.5.0.0.703\n\nOur careful research lets you reproduce the subtle nuances that make analog photography beautiful. With Exposure, your photo will look like it was made by a human, not a computer. \n\nExposure helps you visually explore carefully designed looks, reducing the need to fiddle with techy controls. The redesigned user interface in Exposure 5 reduces distraction and provides new ways to quickly find your style. There is a much wider range of textures and new controls to subtly combine them. Exposure works everywhere you do, now with Aperture support and as a standalone application that provides easy batch processing.\n\nEye.Candy.7.1.0.1192\n\nEye Candy 7 renders realistic effects that are difficult or impossible to achieve in Photoshop alone, such as Fire, Chrome, and the new Lightning. Effects like Animal Fur, Smoke, and Reptile Skin are rendered in exquisite detail down to individual hairs, turbulent wisps, and shiny scales.\n\nEye Candy helps you quickly explore and design looks. In Eye Candy 7, effects are chosen through easy to recognize icons rather than text menus. Presets are rapidly previewed by simply mousing over them. The theme is less clicking and more visual browsing.\n\nSnap.Art.4.0.0.366\n\nTransforming your photographs into beautiful works of art has never been easier than with Snap Art 4. By analyzing the visual elements and techniques of artists through the centuries, we have designed Snap Art to produce images that look they were made by a human, not a computer.\n\nSnap Art 4 lets you experiment with multiple artistic styles via a simple, sleek user interface. The refreshed design and layout reduces distractions and provides fast visual browsing of a wide array of presets so you can achieve perfect results quicker than ever. Snap Art works everywhere you do, now with Aperture support and as a standalone application that provides easy batch processing.\n\nHost Requirements\n\nBlow Up and Bokeh are plug-ins and require a host application.
