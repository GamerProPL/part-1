It&amp;#039;s as evident in John F. Kennedy&amp;#039;s hold over the masses as it is in Cleopatra&amp;#039;s hold over Antony. Now, the author of the bestselling The 48 Laws of Power has written a handbook synthesizing the classic literature of seduction from Freud to Kierkegaard and Ovid to Casanova, with cunning strategies illustrated by the successes and failures of characters throughout history. And once again Robert Greene identifies the rules of a timeless, amoral game and explores how to cast a spell, break down resistance, and, ultimately, compel a target to surrender. The Art of Seduction takes us through the characters and qualities of the ten archetypal figures of seduction (including the Siren, the Ideal Lover, the Dandy, the Natural, the Charismatic, and the Star) and the twenty-four maneuvers by which anyone can overcome a victim&amp;#039;s futile resistance to the practice of this devastating and timeless art form. Every bit as essential as The 48 Laws of Power, The Art of Seduction is an indispensable primer of persuasion that reveals one of history&amp;#039;s greatest weapons and the ultimate form of power. \n\nMain Description\nThis mesmerizing exploration of the most subtle, elusive, and effective form of power is a masterful analysis of civilization&amp;#039;s greatest seducers, from Cleopatra to JFK, as well as the classic literature of seduction from Freud to Kierkegaard and Ovid to Casanova. Robert Greene once again identifies the rules of a timeless, amoral game and explores how to cast a spell, break down resistance, and, ultimately, compel a target to surrender. Presenting the timeless profiles of each type of seducer and the twenty-four maneuvers that will guide you step by step in the game of seduction, The Art of Seduction is an indispensable primer of persuasion that reveals the timeless power of this age-old art.\nWhen raised to the level of art, seduction has toppled empires, won elections, and enslaved great minds. In this volume, Greene asks readers what kind of seducers they want to become.\n\n\nEditorial Reviews\n\nFrom Library Journal\nTouted as a &quot;handbook on the most subtle and effective form of power&quot; and &quot;an indispensable primer on how to take what you want from whomever you want,&quot; this book is more than a little creepy. Following on the heels of his 48 Laws of Power, this book continues Greene&amp;#039;s gross exploration of social power, this time in the realm of sexual politics. In Part 1, Greene, again paired with &quot;packager&quot; Joost Elffers (Play with Your Food), offers a straight-faced description of the nine types of seductive character, from the &quot;Ideal Lover&quot; to the &quot;Rake.&quot; Elffers&amp;#039;s contribution comes in the form of numerous quotes by famous contemporary and historical figures tucked into the side margins. Part 2 examines the process of seduction, subdivided into four phases, with chapter headings such as &quot;Master the Art of Insinuation&quot; and &quot;Isolate the Victim.&quot; This book will have real appeal for power mongers, gold diggers, and heartless manipulators everywhere. Books such as Beverley East&amp;#039;s Finding Mr. Write (LJ 5/1/00) and Jama Clark&amp;#039;s What the Hell Do Women Really Want? (Island Flower, 1997) offer advice on the same subject without the distasteful exploitative emphasis. David Valencia, King Cty. Lib. Syst., WA\n\nFrom Booklist\nGreene is the author of The 48 Laws of Power (1998), a compilation of quotes from throughout history that prescribe methods of obtaining and wielding power. He now adds seduction to the mix of stratagems for those who feel the need to scheme to get what they want. Given the popularity of so-called reality-based television programs, it is clear there is a large audience of such people. Greene, again providing quotes on his topic from philosophers, scientists, playwrights, and novelists, examines &quot;the achievements of the greatest seducers throughout history&quot; and profiles 10 seductive archetypes. Although the tactics Greene advises may be distasteful to some, his literary survey is fascinating. As was Greene&amp;#039;s previous work, this one is billed as &quot;A Joost Elffers Production.&quot; Elffers is identified--with no hint of embarrassment--as a book &quot;packager.&quot; A &quot;quote&quot; from a Newsweek review of The 48 Laws is used to hype the new book, though the actual article in which the quote appeared challenged Greene&amp;#039;s credentials as an editor and playwright and offered only lukewarm praise.

One by one he exposes the techniques of behaviour control used by and against all of us in every area of our lives from business to bedroom. But it is when he explores the scheming psyche of the sexual predator that he is at his most compelling.&amp;#039; Daily Mail &amp;#039;It unearths the two sides of seduction: the characters and the process. The book prepares you for the ultimate seduction: your boss.&amp;#039; Fran Cutler, the Daily Express --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\n\nProduct Description\nRobert Greene&amp;#039;s previous bestseller, The 48 Laws of Power, distilled 3,000 years of scheming into a guide People praised as &quot;beguiling... literate... fascinating&quot; and Kirkus denounced as &quot;an anti-Book of Virtues.&quot;\n\nIn Art of Seduction, Greene returns with a new instruction book on the most subtle, elusive, and effective form of power because seduction isn&amp;#039;t really about sex. It&amp;#039;s about manipulating other people&amp;#039;s greatest weakness: their desire for pleasure.\n\nSynthesizing the work of thinkers including Freud, Diderot, Nietzsche, and Einstein, reporting the enticing strategies of characters throughout history, The Art of Seduction is a comprehensive guide to getting what we want any way we can.\n\nAbout the Author\nRobert Greene is a self-described history nut with a degree in classical studies. He has worked in New York as an editor and writer at several magazines including Esquire and in Hollywood as a story developer and writer. He is also the author of The Art of Seduction and lives in Los Angeles.\n\nFrom AudioFile\nThe author of THE 48 LAWS OF POWER gives us another tour de force on influence, this time on the mysterious process of seduction. He describes nine basic types of seducers, and each one is illustrated by marvelous examples from history and popular culture. Skillfully drawn and paced, the examples bring to life character types that will make sense to everyone from the casual listener to the serious student of this type of influence. The reading here is too dramatic for my taste, but it&amp;#039;s a minor distraction in an otherwise captivating picture of how the skillful seducer operates. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f9ab06de30cb32152e82adbaf7d330c181e4c5e","amp;dn":"Robert+Greene+-+The+Art+of+Seduction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f9ab06de30cb32152e82adbaf7d330c181e4c5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,154,176,109,227,12,179,33,82,232,42,219,175,125,51,12,24,30,76,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
