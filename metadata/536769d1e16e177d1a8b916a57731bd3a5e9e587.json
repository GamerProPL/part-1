He is also known as a pop, R&amp;B, and scat singer. This one-time child prodigy topped the Billboard 200 in 1976 with the triple-platinum album, Breezin'. He was also a major live attraction in the UK during the 1980s. Benson uses a rest-stroke picking technique similar to that of gypsy jazz players such as Django Reinhardt.\n\n.: George Benson :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img242.imageshack.us/img242/8482/georgebensonbt0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img242.imageshack.us/img242/8482/georgebensonbt0.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nGibley Gravy -1968\nThe Other Side of Abbey Road -1969\nWhite Rabbit -1971\nBest of George Benson -1971\nBenson &amp; Farrel -1976\nBreezin -1976\nIn Flight -1976\nThe Best of George Benson 1976\nWeekend in L.A -1977\nIn Your Eyes -1978\nGive Me The Night -1980\n20 - 20 -1984\nCollaboration -1987\nTenderly -1989\nBig Boss Band -1990\nLove Remembers -1993\nThat's Right -1996\nStanding Together -1998\nAbsolute Benson -2000\nAntology -2000\nThe George Benson Cookbook -2001\nMidnight Moods -2002\nVery Best Of The Greatest Hits Of Hall -2004","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:536769d1e16e177d1a8b916a57731bd3a5e9e587","amp;dn":"George+Benson+-+23+Albums+%5BMp3+320+kbps%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"536769d1e16e177d1a8b916a57731bd3a5e9e587","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,103,105,209,225,110,23,125,26,139,145,106,87,115,27,211,165,233,229,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
