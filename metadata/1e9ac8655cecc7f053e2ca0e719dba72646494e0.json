Once there they begin affecting the plot as they interact with the characters and try to get back to reality. The soundtrack for the movie begins in modern times, with a bouncy, very modern-sounding pop song sung by female lead Maia Mitchell, before heading back to the surfy, rocking sounds of the early '60s. The album hits all the era's highlights, copping sounds from the Beach Boys, girl groups, early rock &amp; roll, and surf music, while letting the teenage stars show off their talents. Both Ross Lynch (of Austin &amp; Ally fame) and newcomer Mitchell have really strong voices and put the (sometimes dorky, even for a beach movie homage) lyrics across well, while Grace Phipps gives the girl group-influenced &quot;Falling for Ya&quot; some real yearning soul. Elsewhere there are sweet ballads, good-time rockers (that sound more Grease-inspired than Elvis-inspired), and bopping love songs that move the story along and are also a bunch of fun. There's even a song, &quot;Like Me,&quot; that deals with the different approaches to dating taken by teens from the two eras. The record has a slick, modern sheen but the producers pay attention to detail and add all kinds of nice touches that will warm the hearts of old-timers and maybe turn a few kids on to the Beach Boys. Overall, Teen Beach Movie is a fun soundtrack that features a very game and talented cast and has an easygoing charm and sugary niceness that are very hard to dislike.\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e9ac8655cecc7f053e2ca0e719dba72646494e0","amp;dn":"Disney+Teen+Beach+Movie+%282013%29+Soundtrack+%40+320+Kbps+-+VA+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e9ac8655cecc7f053e2ca0e719dba72646494e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,154,200,101,92,236,199,240,83,226,202,14,113,157,186,114,100,100,148,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
