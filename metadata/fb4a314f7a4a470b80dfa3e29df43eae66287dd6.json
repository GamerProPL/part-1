The program is able to\nmeasure the hardware capacity of\nvarious devices, from tablets and\nsmartphones to personal computers.\n\n3DMark supports the latest graphics\ntechnologies (comprising DirectX 11\nbenchmarking capabilities), but is\nalso able to work with DirectX 9 and\n10 hardware. Bent on evaluating 3D\ngraphics abilities, it?s safe to say\nthat the targeted audience consists\nmostly of gamers.\n\nMuch like any other benchmarking\napplication, 3DMark assesses and\nrates your graphics card with a score\n(high scores indicate better\nperformance). What sets 3DMark apart\nfrom similar software is the\npossibility to compare scores across\nplatforms (Windows, iOS and Android).\n\nBenchmarking your hardware with\n3DMark is fun and complication-free.\nThe software includes three major\ntests, all of which are pleasant to\nexplore, because of the stunning\ngraphics bundled in each of them.\n\nThe first one, Fire Strike includes\nthe most technical benchmark, with\nstate-of-the-art showcase graphics.\nIts complexity makes is suitable for\nhigh-end, high-performance personal\ncomputers.\n\nCloud Gate, the second of the\ntrinity, is built on the DirectX 11\nengine, but also supports DirectX 10\nhardware. Consisting of two graphical\ntests and a physics test, it?s aimed\nat notebooks and typical home\ncomputers.\n\nThe last of the tests, namely Ice\nStorm is designed for a wider array\nof devices, including smartphones and\ntablets and is able to test DirectX 9\ngraphics cards. As a side note, even\nthough 3DMark supports DirectX 9 / 10\nhardware, the device put to test\nneeds to encase DirectX 11 compatible\nfeatures.\n\nAll in all, 3DMark makes one of the\nbest choices, considering its\ncompetitors. It's specialized on\nassessing the performance of graphics\ncards, which makes it a must for\ngamers.\n\n\nURL: http://www.futuremark.com\n\n\n\n           * iNSTALL NOTES *\n\n1.)
