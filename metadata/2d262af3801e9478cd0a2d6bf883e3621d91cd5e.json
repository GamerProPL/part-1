But Holly is no typical teenage runaway: A sensitive child once contacted by voices she knew only as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the radio people,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Holly is a lightning rod for psychic phenomena. Now, as she wanders deeper into the English countryside, visions and coincidences reorder her reality until they assume the aura of a nightmare brought to life.\n\nFor Holly has caught the attention of a cabal of dangerous mysticsÃ¢â‚¬â€and their enemies. But her lost weekend is merely the prelude to a shocking disappearance that leaves her family irrevocably scarred. This unsolved mystery will echo through every decade of HollyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, affecting all the people Holly lovesÃ¢â‚¬â€even the ones who are not yet born.\n\nA Cambridge scholarship boy grooming himself for wealth and influence, a conflicted father who feels alive only while reporting on the war in Iraq, a middle-aged writer mourning his exile from the bestseller listÃ¢â‚¬â€all have a part to play in this surreal, invisible war on the margins of our world. From the medieval Swiss Alps to the nineteenth-century Australian bush, from a hotel in Shanghai to a Manhattan townhouse in the near future, their stories come together in moments of everyday grace and extraordinary wonder.\n\n\n\nRead by Jessica Ball (Narrator), Leon Williams (Narrator), Colin Mace (Narrator), Steven Crossley (Narrator), Laurel Lefkow (Narrator), Anna Bentinck (Narrator)\nFormat: M4A\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d262af3801e9478cd0a2d6bf883e3621d91cd5e","amp;dn":"David+Mitchell+-+The+Bone+Clocks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d262af3801e9478cd0a2d6bf883e3621d91cd5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,38,42,243,128,30,148,120,205,10,45,107,248,131,227,98,29,145,205,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
