Collectively known as &quot;the Eds,&quot; the three hang around in a suburban cul-de-sac. Led by Eddy, the Eds scheme to make money off their peers, but their plans usually fail, leaving them in various predicaments. The number of characters in Ed, Edd n Eddy is fixed at twelve. No other characters have appeared besides the main cast and adults are never seen. There is no given timeline for the show; Danny Antonucci has stated that he wanted the show to appeal to any generation. Therefore, if a VCR or computer is needed in a plot, it is there.\n\nWIKI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Edd_%27n_Eddy\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0184111/\n\nCreator: Danny Antonucci.\nDirectors: Danny Antonucci, Russ Mooney, Marlene Robinson May, John McIntyre.\nWriters: Mike Kubat, Rachel Connor, Danny Antonucci, Jono Howard, Michael Hockney, Geoff Berner, John Mein.\nStarring: Keenan Christenson, Kathleen Barr, Tabitha St. Germain, Matt Hill, Sam Vincent, Tony Sampson, Janyse Jaud, Erin Fitzgerald, Peter Kelamis, David Paul Grove, Jenn Forgie.\n\nVLC Player Compatible (verson # 0.8.6f): {Tested and Confirmed}\n\nSeason 1...\n\nS1E01a - The Ed-Touchables\nS1E01b - Nagged To Ed\nS1E02a - Pop Goes The Ed\nS1E02b - A Pinch To Grow An Ed\nS1E03a - Sir Ed-A-Lot\nS1E03b - Quick Shot Ed\nS1E04a - Read All About Ed\nS1E04b - Over Your Ed\nS1E05a - An Ed Too Many\nS1E05b - Ed-n-Seek\nS1E06a - Look Into My Eds\nS1E06b - Tag Yer Ed\nS1E07a - Dawn of the Eds\nS1E07b - Virt-Ed-Go\nS1E08a - Keeping Up With The Eds\nS1E08b - Who, What, Where, Ed\nS1E09a - Fool on the Ed\nS1E09b - A Boy And His Ed\nS1E10a - Laugh Ed Laugh\nS1E10b - It&amp;#039;s Way Ed\nS1E11a - Eds-Aggerate\nS1E11b - Oath To An Ed\nS1E12a - A Glass Of Warm Ed\nS1E12b - Flea Bitten Ed\nS1E13a - Button Yer Ed\nS1E13b - Avast Ye Eds\n\nSeason 2...\n\nS2E01a - Eeny, Meeny, Miney, Ed\nS2E01b - Ready, Set...

And those are ideas we want to express to our kids as early as possible. They need to grow up knowing that the only way they can achieve what they individually seek, their liberty and fair share of the fruits of their labors, is by acting collectively. All power to the syndicates!]\n\nThis torrent is a part of Operation: Massive Information Leak, Wave Two.\nBloodLogic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e32039f8b8d3c1e2fcaa107ae37a842309b905d","amp;dn":"Ed%2C+Edd%2C+n%5C%27+Eddy+-+Seasons+1-5+%2B+Extras+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e32039f8b8d3c1e2fcaa107ae37a842309b905d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,50,3,159,139,141,60,30,47,202,161,7,174,55,168,66,48,155,144,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
