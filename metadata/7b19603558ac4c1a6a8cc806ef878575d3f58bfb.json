She then went on to save Peter Parker's life (more than once!) and traverse the Spider-verse alongside Spider-Woman. Now, as SILK, Cindy is on her own in New York City, searching for her past, defining her own future, and webbing up wrong-doers along the way! Robbie Thompson (writer from TV's Supernatural) fills this new ongoing series with his unique blend of antics and feels. Featuring stunning covers by Eisner Award winner Dave Johnson and interiors by future superstar Stacey Lee","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b19603558ac4c1a6a8cc806ef878575d3f58bfb","amp;dn":"Silk+001+%282015%29+%28Digital%29+%28Zone-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b19603558ac4c1a6a8cc806ef878575d3f58bfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,25,96,53,88,172,76,26,106,140,200,6,239,135,133,117,211,245,139,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
