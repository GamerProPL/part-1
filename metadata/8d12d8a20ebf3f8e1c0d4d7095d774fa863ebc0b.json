Yellow Light\n\n  Of Monsters and Men's 2012 full-length debut, My Head Is an Animal, features more of the Icelandic band's acoustic-driven alt-rock featured on their 2011 EP Into the Woods. Showcasing the dual singer/guitarist/songwriters Nanna BryndÃƒÂ­s HilmarsdÃƒÂ³ttir and Ragnar Ã¢â‚¬Å“RaggiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ PÃƒÂ³rhallsson, the album also displays the six-piece ensemble's grand and anthemic style with a bent toward passionate folk-rock uplift and more layered, introspective moments. In that sense, the band brings to mind the work of such similarly inclined contemporaries as Arcade Fire, Angus &amp; Julia Stone, and Mumford &amp; Sons. While such cuts as the peppy, horn-driven &quot;Little Talks,&quot; &quot;Six Weeks,&quot; &quot;Love Love Love,&quot; and &quot;From Finner&quot; are carryovers from Into the Woods, elsewhere we get the cinematic build of &quot;King and Lionheart,&quot; the catchy, Florence + the Machine-sounding singalong &quot;Mountain Sound,&quot; and the reverb-laden &quot;Lakehouse.&quot; There's even the very '60s Celtic folk-meets-Ennio Morricone number &quot;Your Bones.&quot; Thoughtfully crafted and full of melancholic lyricism and quietly desperate romanticism, My Head Is an Animal should appeal to any fan -- whether man or monster -- of sweet and wide-eyed folk-rock.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d12d8a20ebf3f8e1c0d4d7095d774fa863ebc0b","amp;dn":"Of+Monsters+and+Men+-+My+Head+is+an+Animal+%282012%29+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d12d8a20ebf3f8e1c0d4d7095d774fa863ebc0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,18,216,162,14,191,63,142,28,13,77,112,149,215,116,250,134,62,188,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
