After consulting for him on a FBI case, she is approached by cocky yet charming ex-Army Ranger turned Special Agent, Seeley Booth to help the Bureau solve crimes by identifying human remains that are too far gone for standard FBI forensic investigations. Brennan's empirical, literal view of the world causes friction with Booths emotive, instinctive attitude creating a volatile relationship. However as their case load increases the symbiotic partnership produces results and with the support of Brennan's Squint Squad, more and more cases are closed successfully.\n\nIn Season 6 Bones and Booth are back to square one. When they are both called back to DC by Prosecutor Caroline Julian, Booth comes back with some news: that he has moved on and is in love now with the journalist Hannah Burley he got to know in the war zone he was assigned to. While Bones has to somehow adapt to this new situation, Angela and Hodgins are looking forward to having their Baby. Sweets and Daisy have their usual on and off game running and Dr. Saroyan struggles once more with being a parent to her teenage adopted daughter Michelle.\n\nFantastic show, which has been renewed for another season, but if you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know season 1 to 5 yet, you should definitely get them ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worth the while!\n\nList of Episodes:\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bones_episodes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bones_episodes&lt;/a&gt;  \n\nGet every Season of Bones in the KABLAM!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=592192#pid592192&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=592192#pid592192&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTHIS TORRENTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S EPISODE 01 CONTAINS A FEW MINUTES OF ADDITIONAL TRAILERS -\nALL OTHER EPISODES ARE THE ORIGINAL HDTV-SCENE-RIPS!\n\n\n\nFormat :\t\tXviD\nFile size:  \t\t349 MiB avg. per episode\nDuration : \t\t43 min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t\t624 pixels\nHeight : \t\t352 pixels\nAspect ratio : \t        16:9\nFrame rate : \t        23,976fps\nAudio: \t\t        MP3\nNr. of Files:\t\t23 + 2 Trailer + 1 txt + 1txt + 20 EXTRAS = 47\n\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original file names intact.\nThis pack wouldn't have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++VTV+++scenebalance+++TorrentDay+++eztv+++\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n\n######################  You like your show in one pack?  ########################\n##############################  Here you go!  ###################################\n                        VISIT THE KABLAM!!! at SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12fd08ee971c25f78d253ed23b30e8fb277e4609","amp;dn":"Bones+-+Season+6+Complete+HDTV+%28XviD%2FMP3%29%2BExtras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12fd08ee971c25f78d253ed23b30e8fb277e4609","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,253,8,238,151,28,37,247,141,37,62,210,59,48,232,251,39,126,70,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
