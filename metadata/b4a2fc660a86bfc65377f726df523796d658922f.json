Dick\n\n\nDescription: Philip Kindred Dick (December 16, 1928 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ March 2, 1982) was an American novelist, short story writer, essayist and philosopher whose published work is almost entirely accepted as being in the science fiction genre. Dick explored sociological, political and metaphysical themes in novels dominated by monopolistic corporations, authoritarian governments, and altered states. In his later works Dick's thematic focus strongly reflected his personal interest in metaphysics and theology. He often drew upon his own life experiences in addressing the nature of drug abuse, paranoia, schizophrenia, and transcendental experiences in novels such as A Scanner Darkly and VALIS. He also wrote extensively on philosophy, theology, the nature of reality and science later in his life that was published posthumously as The Exegesis.\n\nBooks:\n\n\nUnless mentioned otherwise, the following books included are in the ePUB format.\n\nNovels:\n\n* Gather Yourselves Together\n\n* Voices from the Street\n\n* Vulcan's Hammer\n\n* Dr. Futurity\n\n* The Cosmic Puppets\n\n* Solar Lottery\n\n* Mary and the Giant\n\n* The World Jones Made\n\n* Eye in the Sky\n\n* The Man Who Japed\n\n* The Broken Bubble\n\n* Puttering About In a Small Land\n\n* Time Out of Joint\n\n* In Milton Lumky Territory\n\n* Confessions of a Crap Artist\n\n* The Man Whose Teeth Were All Exactly Alike\n\n* Humpty Dumpty in Oakland\n\n* The Man in the High Castle -- EPUB, MOBI\n\n* We Can Build You\n\n* Martian Time-Slip\n\n* Dr. Bloodmoney\n\n* The Game-Players of Titan\n\n* The Simulacra\n\n* The Crack in Space\n\n* Now Wait for Last Year\n\n* Clans of the Alphane Moon -- MOBI\n\n* The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch -- EPUB, MOBI\n\n* The Zap Gun\n\n* The Penultimate Truth\n\n* Deus Irae\n\n* Lies, Inc.\n\n* The Ganymede Takeover\n\n* Counter-Clock World\n\n* Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\n\n* Nick and the Glimmung\n\n* Ubik -- EPUB, MOBI\n\n* Galactic Pot-Healer\n\n* A Maze of Death\n\n* Our Friends from Frolix 8\n\n* Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said  -- EPUB, MOBI\n\n* A Scanner Darkly\n\n* Radio Free Albemuth\n\n* The VALIS Trilogy: VALIS, The Divine Invasion, The Transmigration of Timothy Archer\n\n* The Exegesis of Philip K.
