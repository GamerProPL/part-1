Celebration: The Best Of puts that misconception to rights with a collection of her classic tracks, banishing any doubts about Madonna's place in pop royalty. If there's a Madonna song you like (and there is), it's here.\n\nBeginning with a quartet of number ones - Hung Up, Music, Vogue and 4 Minutes - and never relenting, the album intersperses hits from every era of Madge's career to dizzying effect. This means you can get yourself in 80's 'Like A Virgin' disco-pop mode only to be abruptly flung into late 90's moves-a-busting, electro-dance before careening back into a 'Holiday' sing-a-long. A giddy selection, but it's the best way to deal with an artist who has such a varied and eclectic back catalogue. From pop to disco through ballads, electro and super-star collaborations, she's done it all. You might think that uniting these seemingly disparate elements was an impossible task, but Celebration manages it.\n\nAs a globally-recognised, multi-million record-selling, genre-straddling performer, Madonna must wonder what's left for her. Celebration shows that, whatever her future endeavours, her position in music history is firmly in place. All that's left is for her fans to enjoy the wall-to-wall hits collated on this record, a collection which - in this age of instant, short-term super-stars - serves as a timely reminder of what constitutes true, enduring star quality. All hail Queen Madge!\n\n[img]http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/5886/tracklistxy2.gif[/img]\n\n Disc 1\n\n   1. Hung Up\n   2. Music\n   3. Vogue\n   4. 4 Minutes\n   5. Holiday\n   6.
