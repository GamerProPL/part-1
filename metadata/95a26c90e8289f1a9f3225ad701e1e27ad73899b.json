It runs on Mac OS X and Windows. It was first released by Quark, Inc. in 1987 and is still owned and published by them.\nThe most recent version, QuarkXPress 9, allows publishing in English and 36 other languages, including Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, German, Korean, Russian, French, and Spanish.\nQuarkXPress is used by individual designers and large publishing houses to produce a variety of layouts, from single-page flyers to the multi-media projects required for magazines, newspapers, catalogs, and the like. QuarkXPress once dominated the market for page layout software with over 95% market share among professional users. While one publisher estimates that share has fallen to below 25% and Adobe InDesign is now the market leader, QuarkXPress still has significant marketshare.\nThere are open source competitors in the page layout space, the most notable of which is Scribus.\n\n\n.: Software Data :.\nName:  Quark XPress 9.1\nLanguage: MultiLang\nVersion: 9.1\nGenre:  Pages Editing\nProducer:  Quark Inc.\nRelease date:  14th April 2011\n\n\n.: System Requirements :.\n-&gt;[b]OS:[/b] Windows XP (SP2 or greater) Windows Vista or Windows 7 (and .NET Framework 3.5 SP1)\n-&gt;[b]Ram:[/b] 1 GB\n-&gt;[b]Hard Drive:[/b] 1 GB of free disk space\n\n\n.: Instructions :.\n-&gt;Extract the archive\n-&gt;Install and use the included serials\n-&gt;Enjoy ;)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95a26c90e8289f1a9f3225ad701e1e27ad73899b","amp;dn":"Quark+XPress+9.1+%5BRar+-+MultiLang%5D%5BTNT+Village%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95a26c90e8289f1a9f3225ad701e1e27ad73899b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,162,108,144,232,40,159,26,159,50,37,173,112,30,30,39,173,115,137,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
