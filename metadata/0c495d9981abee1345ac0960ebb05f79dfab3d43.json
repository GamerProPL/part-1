I am an avid collector, of Earl Klugh, Peter White, Dave Grusin, Kenny Gee, David Sanborn, Wes Montgomery, Patrice Ruschen, David Benoit, Tommy Flanaghan, Nancy Wilson, and so many more I can't cover. This series is one of the best I have heard in some time. I gave it five stars, because its tops in my book. Such variety, such style, such CLASS. Great job! ~ Wayne Grabble\n\nI purchased this album in Singapore 5 years ago at an HMV music store where it was the featured CD in their jazz section. It was then, and is now the finest Jazz CD I have ever heard. I gave a copy of it to the owner of a Jazz bar I frequent near Tokyo, and he plays it every Friday night. Amazingly popular with guests, and generally anybody that listens to it, it will make a smooth jazz lover out of anyone. ~ a Customer, Amazon\n\nPersonnel:\nAcoustic Alchemy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Performer\nAnthony Barboza ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Photography\nZachary Breaux ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Performer\nNorman Brown ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Performer\nLarry Carlton ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Performer\nLarry Coryell ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Performer\nFattburger ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Performer\nRandall Grass ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Executive Producer\nJeff Heiman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Producer, Liner Notes\nRonnie Jordan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Performer\nChuck Loeb ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Performer\nChieli Minucci ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Performer\nJoan Pelosi ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Design\nLee Ritenour ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Performer\nArtie Traum ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Producer, Performer, Liner Notes\nDanny Weiss ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Executive Producer\nPeter White ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Performer \n\nVA The Very Best Of Smooth Jazz Guitar Tracklist:\n01  Ronnie Jordan - After Hours\n02  Lee Ritenour - Night Rhythms\n03  Larry Carlton - Smiles and Smiles to Go\n04  Peter White - Promenade\n05  Acoustic Alchemy - Playing for Time\n06  Larry Coryell - Feel Like Making Love\n07  Chieli Minucci - Anthing and Everything\n08  Norman Brown - Just Between Us\n09  Zachary Breaux - Cafe Reggio\n10  Artie Traum - Quiet Volcano\n11  Chuck Loeb - The Music Inside\n12  Fattburger - Anything's Possible","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c495d9981abee1345ac0960ebb05f79dfab3d43","amp;dn":"VA+The+Very+Best+Of+Smooth+Jazz+Guitar+%281998%29+%5BJazz%5Dmp3+320%5D%5Bh33","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c495d9981abee1345ac0960ebb05f79dfab3d43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,73,93,153,129,171,238,19,69,172,9,96,235,176,95,121,223,171,61,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
