This has multiple benefits including flexibility, support for multiple protocols, simplification of the routing tables in the network core and centralized control of the MPLS L3VPNs. \n\n\nContent:\n01 - Welcome to MPLS Fundamentals\n02 - The Big Picture\n03 - Label-Based Forwarding\n04 - Implementing MPLS\n05 - LDP\n06 - LSP Path Selection\n07 - LIBs, FIBs and RIBs\n08 - Transport Address\n09 - MPLS L3VPN Architecture\n10 - PE to PE MBGP\n11 - VRFs\n12 - CE to PE Routing\n13 - Redistribution\n14 - Control and Data Plane Verification\n15 - VRF Enabled Utilities\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93f1db92681432bb9c2db7aa4508e8ef20f30430","amp;dn":"CBT+Nuggets+-+MPLS+Fundamentals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93f1db92681432bb9c2db7aa4508e8ef20f30430","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,241,219,146,104,20,50,187,156,45,183,170,69,8,232,239,32,243,4,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
