A curious, organic artifact falls from the starry sky and inexplicably, without asking permission, transports you across the universe. Youâ€™ve been abducted from your cozy existence and added into an alien landscape with a stereotypical Kansas farmhouse, a white picket fence, and a rather bizarre little ghost town - wellâ€¦ almost ghost town. Adding to the oddity, you discover a strangely kluged kiosk that reassuringly welcomes you to Hunrath.\r\nThe new worlds of Obduction reveal their secrets only as you explore, coax, and consider them. And as you bask in the otherworldly beauty and explore through the enigmatic landscapes, remember that the choices you make will have substantial consequences. This is your story now.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: 7 SP1 64 bit or newer\r\nProcessor: CPU Intel i5-2500 equivalent or better\r\nMemory: 8 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: GeForce 660 GTX w/1GB / AMD 7700 series w/1GB equivalent or better \r\nStorage: 20 GB available space\r\n\r\nRecommended system requirements - Windows: 10 64 bit \r\nProcessor: CPU Intel i5-4590 equivalent or better \r\nMemory: 16 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: NVIDIA GTX 970 w/4 GB / AMD R9 290 w/4 GB equivalent or better \r\nStorage: 20 GB available space \r\nSSD highly recommended","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2096df478886cecb94b57ca074b3ccba5361838e","amp;dn":"Obduction+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2096df478886cecb94b57ca074b3ccba5361838e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,150,223,71,136,134,206,203,148,181,124,160,116,179,204,186,83,97,131,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
