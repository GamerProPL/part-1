Linux kernel networking is a complex topic, so the book won't burden you with topics not directly related to networking. This book will also not overload you with cumbersome line-by-line code walkthroughs not directly related to what you're searching for; you'll find just what you need, with in-depth explanations in each chapter and a quick reference at the end of each chapter. Linux Kernel Networking is the only up-to-date reference guide to understanding how networking is implemented in the latest version of the Linux kernel, and it will be indispensable in years to come since so many devices now use Linux or operating systems based on Linux, like Android, and since Linux is so prevalent in the datacenter arena, including Linux-based virtualization technologies like Xen. What you'll learn * Kernel networking basics, including socket buffers * How key protocols like ICMP are implemented * In-depth looks at both IPv4 and IPv6 * Everything you need to know about Linux routing * How netfilter and IPsec are implemented * Linux wireless networking * Additional topics like Infiniband, BlueZ, the Android API, and network monitoring Who this book is for Software developers and architects, project managers, CTOs, network admins and architects, network security professionals, computer science researchers, and Linux kernel hackers. A basic knowledge of C and networking is required; basic knowledge of the Linux kernel is helpful but not mandatory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d476bf3b1ebb0fca848dc2cc0e6722d2a52f20b","amp;dn":"Linux+Kernel+Networking+-+Implementation+and+Theory+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d476bf3b1ebb0fca848dc2cc0e6722d2a52f20b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,71,107,243,177,235,176,252,168,72,220,44,192,230,114,45,42,82,242,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
