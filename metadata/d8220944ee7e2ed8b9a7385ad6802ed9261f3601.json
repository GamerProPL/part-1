The band's main lyrical themes are based on war and historical battles. This is heard in the albums Primo Victoria, Attero Dominatus, Coat of Arms, Carolus Rex and Heroes, in which all of the songs contain these motifs, except final tracks which are tribute songs to influential heavy metal bands. Lyrical content drawn from World War I, World War II and other conflicts is prevalent and includes songs about battles and leaders on all sides of said conflicts.\r\n\r\nIn April 2012, guitarists Oskar Montelius and Rikard SundÃ©n, drummer Daniel Mullback and keyboardist Daniel MÃ¿hr left the band to form Civil War. Vocalist Joakim BrodÃ©n and bassist PÃ¤r SundstrÃ¶m continued with new members. As well as extensively touring internationally, the band have a festival in their home town of Falun, Sabaton Open Air in August.\r\n\r\nTracklists\r\n\r\n  \r\nDisk 1\r\n\r\n11.
