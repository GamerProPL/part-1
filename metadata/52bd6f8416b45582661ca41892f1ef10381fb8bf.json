He was one of the key figures in the philosophy of existentialism and phenomenology, and one of the leading figures in 20th-century French philosophy and Marxism.  His work continues to influence a broad range of disciplines, including sociology, critical theory, post-colonial theory, and literary studies.  Sartre was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature but refused it, saying that he always declined official honors and that &quot;a writer should not allow himself to be turned into an institution.&quot;\n\nThis collection includes several notable examples of Sartre's fiction and plays; two autobiographical works; and many volumes of his most important philosophical and critical essays, including BEING AND NOTHINGNESS (1943), CRITIQUE OF DIALECTICAL REASON (1960, 1985), and THE FAMILY IDIOT (1981-94), his monumental (and unfinished) analytical study of Gustave Flaubert spanning five volumes and more than 2700 pages.\n\n\nAll the following books are in PDF format unless otherwise noted:\n\n* THE AGE OF REASON (Vintage, 1992).
