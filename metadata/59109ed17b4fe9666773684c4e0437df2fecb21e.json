Invisible to humans, they nevertheless give their help and comfort to all the lonely and depressed souls they meet. Finally, after many centuries, one of the angels becomes unhappy with his immortal state and wishes to become human in order to experience the joys of everyday life. He meets a circus acrobat and finds in her the fufillment of all his mortal desires. He also discovers that he is not alone in making this cross over, and that a purely spiritual experience is not enough to satisfy anyone. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0093191/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0093191/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWinner of Cannes Film Festival award for best director.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59109ed17b4fe9666773684c4e0437df2fecb21e","amp;dn":"Wings+of+Desire+%2F+Der+Himmel+uber+Berlin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59109ed17b4fe9666773684c4e0437df2fecb21e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,16,158,209,123,79,233,102,103,115,104,76,78,4,55,223,47,236,178,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
