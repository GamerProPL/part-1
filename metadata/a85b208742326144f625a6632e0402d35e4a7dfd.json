Recipes oust hard-to-find gums, such as guar and xanthan, and minimize starches, such as corn, tapioca and potato. Alternative Baker highlights lesser-known flours such as millet, oat, buckwheat, chestnut, sorghum and mesquite. These flours provide recipe with superior texture, flavour and nutritional value to boot. Alternative Baker feature fruit-based recipes that range from breakfast breads to pies, tarts, crisps, cobblers, cakes, custards and small treats like cookies and bars. Examples include Cranberry Millet Scones with Vanilla Bean Glaze; Buckwheat, Pear Walnut Galettes with Salty Honey Caramel; Salty Caramel &amp; Banana Cream Tarts in a Mesquite Crust and Maple Bourbon Peach Cobbler with Brown Butter Biscuits. In addition, the book includes recipes for basics like sauces and accompaniments. Author Alanna Taylor-Tobin is a classically trained pastry chef who has been developing recipes and techniques for her own gluten sensitivity for more than a decade. Her love of alternative, unrefined flours, sweeteners and organic produce is a product of her upbringing by health-nut hippie parents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a85b208742326144f625a6632e0402d35e4a7dfd","amp;dn":"Alternative+Baker+%282016%29+%28Epub%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a85b208742326144f625a6632e0402d35e4a7dfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,91,32,135,66,50,97,68,246,37,166,99,46,4,2,211,94,74,125,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
