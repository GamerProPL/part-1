Based in the underground anti-folk and noise rock worlds, Beck encompassed all manner of modern music, drawing in hip-hop, blues, trash rock, pop, soul, lounge music...pretty much any found sound or vinyl dug up from a dusty crate, blurring boundaries and encapsulating how '90s hipsters looked toward the future by foraging through the past. In another time, Beck may have stayed the province of the underground, but he surfaced just as alternative rock turned mainstream, with his 1994 debut Mellow Gold launching &quot;Loser,&quot; a hit that crossed over with the velocity of a novelty, a notion Beck quickly punctured with a succession of indie LPs delivered in the wake of Mellow Gold, including the lo-fi folk of One Foot In The Grave, delivered on the K imprint. But the album that truly cemented Beck's place in the pantheon was 1996's Odelay, a co-production with the Dust Brothers that touched upon all of his obsessions, providing a cultural keystone for the decade while telegraphing all his future moves, from the soul prankster of Midnite Vultures to the melancholy troubadour of Sea Change. \n\n\nArtist...............: Beck\nAlbum................: Discography\nGenre................: Alternative-Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1993-2014\nRipper...............: NMR\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 62 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: NMR\nPosted by............: vtwin88cube on 2/26/2014\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: COVER ART, ID TAGS, CUE, LOG, AUDIOCHECKER\n\n\n\n\n                            Audio Info:\n\n\n(1993) Golden Feelings\n\n(1994) Mellow Gold\n\n(1994) One Foot In The Grave\n\n(1994) Stereopathetic Soulmanure\n\n(1996) Odelay\n\n(1998) Mutations\n\n(1999) Midnite Vultures\n\n(2000) A Collection Of B Sides Stray Blues\n\n(2002) Sea Change (2009 24k MFSL Ultradisc)\n\n(2005) Guero\n\n(2005) Guerolito\n\n(2006) The Information\n\n(2008) Modern Guilt\n\n(2014) Morning Phase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dba8fd65f7f82d7b116b1f8546ac904c34d6c313","amp;dn":"+Beck+-+Discography+%281993-2014%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dba8fd65f7f82d7b116b1f8546ac904c34d6c313","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,168,253,101,247,248,45,123,17,107,31,133,70,172,144,76,52,214,195,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
