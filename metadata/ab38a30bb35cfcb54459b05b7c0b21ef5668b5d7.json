QuarkXPress is the first layout application to import PDF, Illustrator and EPS files and convert them to native objects.Â° Look forward to fully editable Bezier versions of vector graphics, real text and automatically extracted colors and fonts.\r\n\r\nCopy and Paste Objects from Illustrator, PowerPoint and Others to QuarkXPress\r\nSimply copy items from other applications such as PowerPoint, Illustrator or even InDesign and paste them into your QuarkXPress layout as Native QuarkXPress ObjectsÂ°, allowing you to easily complete or reuse them up in QuarkXPress 2016.\r\n\r\nMulti-Gradient Color Blends\r\nSome things are worth waiting for. With the new Multi-Gradient Color Blends you have all the flexibility youÃ¢Â€â„¢ve yearned for when designing color blends. Create as many color stops as you like, use sliders or numeric settings, opt for the full radial setting or set the aspect ratio. Unlike other layout software, you can even set different opacity levels for each color stop.\r\n\r\nExport as HTML5 Publications\r\nBuilding on the popularity of reflowable and fixed layout eBooks and stunning interactive apps from App Studio, QuarkXPress 2016 adds another digital output format. You can now create HTML5 Publications without any additional software and no additional digital publishing costs. Just upload HTML5 Publications to your own website and show the world. HTML5 Publications displays pixel-perfect layouts on all modern desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers, providing an easy and effective online experience. With HTML5 Publications you can go beyond static print layouts to add interactive enrichments such as scrollable areas, slide shows, animations and more. Quite possibly the easiest way to share your final magazine, newspaper, comics, reports, ads and more. Even use HTML5 Publications to enable Web-based previews for your customers.\r\n\r\nSupport for OpenType Stylistic Sets\r\nTypography lovers â€” itÃ¢Â€â„¢s time to get excited. With modern digital fonts, font designers can group related alternative characters into OpenType Stylistic Sets, which may be switched on together. Stylistic Sets give users the ability to quickly apply these sets with one click. For example, Vollkorn, a free body typeface by Friedrich Althausen, provides two stylistic sets that you can easily switch between. One is a more standard â€œold-styleâ€ set for body text and another â€œplainerâ€ stylistic set is better suited for headlines while preserving the look of the whole body text. QuarkXPress adds support for Stylistic Sets to its OpenType support and allows you to quickly make use of this powerful feature for automating typography.\r\n\r\nXTensions Interface Consistency\r\nIf you have already invested in a publishing system or third party software that integrates with QuarkXPress 2015, thereÃ¢Â€â„¢s good news. You can continue to work with QuarkXPress 2016 without disruption. As the plug-in interface is the same between QuarkXPress 2016 and QuarkXPress 2015, your XTensions will work in the new version uninterrupted (provided the XTension does not conflict with any of the new functionality).\r\n\r\n** System requirements\r\n\r\n- QuarkXPress 2016 requires a dual core CPU with at least 1 GB available for QuarkXPress, ideally 4 GB available for QuarkXPress\r\n- QuarkXPress 2016 is supported on Windows 7, 8 and 10 (all 64 bit only)\r\n- QuarkXPress 2016 does not run on 32 Bit operating systems\r\n- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 or later\r\n- An update for Universal C Runtime is required on Windows 7 and 8.x","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab38a30bb35cfcb54459b05b7c0b21ef5668b5d7","amp;dn":"QuarkXPress+2016+12.1.28316+Multilingual+-+Windows+64-bit+only","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab38a30bb35cfcb54459b05b7c0b21ef5668b5d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,56,163,11,179,92,252,181,68,89,176,91,124,11,33,239,86,104,181,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
