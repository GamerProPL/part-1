It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise, and is the first in a series of shows that will lead up to a Defenders crossover miniseries. The series is produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios, DeKnight Prods. and Goddard Textiles, with Steven S. DeKnight serving as showrunner, and Goddard acting as consultant.\n\nCharlie Cox stars as Matt Murdock / Daredevil, a lawyer-by-day who fights crime at night. The series chronicles the character's early days fighting crime, juxtaposed with the rise of crime lord Wilson Fisk, played by Vincent D'Onofrio. Deborah Ann Woll, Elden Henson, Toby Leonard Moore, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Bob Gunton, Ayelet Zurer, and Rosario Dawson also star. Daredevil entered development in late 2013, a year after the film rights to the character reverted to Marvel, with Goddard initially hired in December 2013. DeKnight replaced him as showrunner and Cox was hired to star in May 2014. Filming began in New York City that July, with production ending in December.\n\nAll episodes of the first season premiered on April 10, 2015.\n\n\n\n\nEpisodes\n\nNo.\tTitle\t                     Directed by\t Written by\t\n\n1\t&quot;Into the Ring&quot;\t             Phil Abraham\t Drew Goddard\n\n2\t&quot;Cut Man&quot;\t             Phil Abraham\t Drew Goddard\t\n\n3\t&quot;Rabbit in a Snow Storm&quot;     Adam Kane\t         Marco Ramirez\n\n4\t&quot;In the Blood&quot;\t             Ken Girotti\t Joe Pokaski\n \n5\t&quot;World on Fire&quot;\t             Farren Blackburn\t Luke Kalteux\n\n6\t&quot;Condemned&quot;\t             Guy Ferland\t Joe Pokaski\n\n7\t&quot;Stick&quot;\t                     Brad Turner         Douglas Petrie\n\n8\t&quot;Shadows in the Glass&quot;\t     Stephen Surjik\t Steven S.
