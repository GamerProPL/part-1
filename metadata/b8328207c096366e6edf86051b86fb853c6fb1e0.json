The quartet of Texas kids, made up of Mark Smith and Munaf Rayani on guitars, Michael James on bass, and Christopher Hrasky on drums, was signed for its first release on Temporary Residence Limited after half a listen to their demo, which was submitted by the American Analog Set with a brief note saying &quot;This totally f*cking destroys.&quot; From that, they released their first six-song album, Those Who Tell the Truth, in the latter half of 2001. After a new record, 2003's contemplative The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place, and the 2005 re-release, Explosions in the Sky, who had by this time garnered a dedicated fan base, came out with All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone in 2007. The band also found some exposure by lending their emotive songwriting to the soundtracks of both the film and television series Friday Night Lights, creating a stirring soundtrack to the drama set in their home state of Texas. In 2011, the quartet got back to writing albums, releasing Take Care, Take Care, Take Care on Temporary Residence. Two years later, the band teamed up with fellow Austin resident David Wingo to do the score for David Gordon Green's film, Prince Avalanche.\n\n\n2000 - How Strange, Innocence\n2001 - Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Die, Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Live Forever\n2003 - The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place\n2004 - Friday Night Lights (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n2005 - The Rescue\n2007 - All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone [Deluxe Version]\n2011 - Take Care, Take Care, Take Care\n2013 - Prince Avalanche_ An Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n\n\nAlbum artwork and rip logs are included.
