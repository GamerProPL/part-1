The New Jim Crow is such a book. Praised by Harvard Law professor Lani Guinier as &quot;brave and bold,&quot; this book directly challenges the notion that the election of Barack Obama signals a new era of colorblindness. With dazzling candor, legal scholar Michelle Alexander argues that &quot;we have not ended racial caste in America; we have merely redesigned it.&quot; By targeting black men through the War on Drugs and decimating communities of color, the U.S. criminal justice system functions as a contemporary system of racial controlÃ¢â‚¬â€relegating millions to a permanent second-class statusÃ¢â‚¬â€even as it formally adheres to the principle of colorblindness. In the words of Benjamin Todd Jealous, president and CEO of the NAACP, this book is a &quot;call to action.&quot;\n\nCalled &quot;stunning&quot; by Pulitzer PrizeÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning historian David Levering Lewis, &quot;invaluable&quot; by the Daily Kos, &quot;explosive&quot; by Kirkus, and &quot;profoundly necessary&quot; by the Miami Herald, this updated and revised paperback edition of The New Jim Crow, now with a foreword by Cornel West, is a must-read for all people of conscience.\n\n\n\nPaperback: 336 pages\nPublisher: New Press, The; Reprint edition (January 16, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1595586431\nISBN-13: 978-1595586438\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/New-Jim-Crow-Incarceration-Colorblindness/dp/1595586431/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/New-Jim-Crow-Incarceration-Colorblindness/dp/1595586431/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nTags: Jim, Crow, race, racism, right, wing, republican, race coding, racially coded, subtle, doublespeak, George W Bush, George H.W Bush, Nixon, John Locke, William F Buckley, barack, obama, barry, black, biracial, IR, multiracial, preseident, bush, war, afghanistan, 2008, change, yes, we, can, hope, biden, china, afghanistan, tea, party, republican, democrat, politics, nobel, prize, war, peace, diplomacy, command, military, race, relations, racism, chicago, senator, white guilt, white anxiety, african, american, african american, black, racism, sociology, social mobiility, social climbing, mentor, race relations, race, militia, hate, nazi, white anxiety, oppression, tea party, fundamentalist, fundementalism, political science, hate group, ghettoization, blacks, african, african american, africans, negro, negrophobia, black brute, stereotype, police, brutality, lynching, kkk, white, race, racism, oppression, extrajudicial, crazed, prison, police, ghettoization, fear, guilt, white guilt, racism, discrimination, oppression, bias, psychology, sociology, bad faith, race, black, african, american, african american, AA, african american studies, society, institutional racism, white guilt, white privilige, denial, double standard, profiling, fear, responsibility, cognitive dissonance, freedom, white anxiety, abuse, disparity, disparities, slavery, experimentation, tuskeegee, unconscious, subconscious,\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83871ca6b1614ab730e421d24bfd49195a74cd65","amp;dn":"The+New+Jim+Crow%3A+Mass+Incarceration+in+the+Age+of+Colorblindnes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83871ca6b1614ab730e421d24bfd49195a74cd65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,135,28,166,177,97,74,183,48,228,33,210,75,253,73,25,90,116,205,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
