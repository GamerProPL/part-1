Combining literary acclaim with widespread popularity, Greene acquired a reputation early in his lifetime as a major writer, both of serious Catholic novels, and of thrillers (or &quot;entertainments&quot; as he termed them), often with a notable philosophic edge.  He was shortlisted for the Nobel Prize but, to the enduring discredit of the Swedish Academy, never won it.\n\nAlthough Greene objected strongly to being described as a Roman Catholic novelist, rather than as a novelist who happened to be Catholic, religious themes are at the root of much of his writing, especially the four major Catholic novels on which he thought his literary reputation would rest: BRIGHTON ROCK (1938), THE POWER AND THE GLORY (1940), THE HEART OF THE MATTER (1948), and THE END OF THE AFFAIR (1951), which are regarded as &quot;the gold standard&quot; of the Catholic novel.  Several works, such as THE CONFIDENTIAL AGENT (1939), THE THIRD MAN (1949), THE QUIET AMERICAN (1955), OUR MAN IN HAVANA (1958), and THE HUMAN FACTOR (1978), also show Greene's avid interest in the workings and intrigues of international politics and espionage.\n\nThe world Greene's characters inhabit is a fallen one, and the tone of his works emphasizes the presence of evil as a palpable force.  His novels display a consistent preoccupation with sin and moral failure acted out in seedy locales characterized by danger, violence, and physical decay.  Greene's chief concern is the moral and spiritual struggles within individuals, but the larger political and social settings of his novels give such conflicts an enhanced resonance.\n\nThe non-fiction collected here includes several volumes of autobiography, travel writings, essays, film criticism, and biography.\n\nThank you to @sniffn and @anmisto for your kind assistance. \n\nThe following books are in ePUB format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n\n                                  == NOVELS == \n\n* Brighton Rock (Vintage, 2002)\n* Burnt-Out Case, A (Vintage, 2004)\n* Captain and the Enemy, The (Vintage, 2011)\n* Comedians, The (Vintage, 2004)\n* Confidential Agent, The (Vintage, 2006)\n* Doctor Fischer of Geneva, or The Bomb Party (Vintage, 1999)\n* End of the Affair, The (Vintage, 2004)\n* England Made Me (Vintage, 2001)\n* Gun For Sale, A (Vintage, 2009)\n* Heart of the Matter, The (Vintage, 2004)\n* Honorary Consul, The (Vintage, 1999)\n* Human Factor, The (Vintage, 2005)\n* It's a Battlefield (Viking, 1962 / Vintage, 2002) -- PDF + ePUB\n* Loser Takes All (Vintage, 2001)\n* Man Within, The (Vintage, 2001)\n* Ministry of Fear, The (Vintage, 2004)\n* Monsignor Quixote (Vintage, 2000)\n* Our Man in Havana (Vintage, 2006)\n* Power and the Glory, The (Vintage, 2001)\n* Quiet American, The (Vintage, 2004)\n* Stamboul Train (Vintage, 2004)\n* Tenth Man, The (Vintage, 2000)\n* Third Man, The / The Fallen Idol (Penguin, 1981) -- PDF\n* Travels With My Aunt (Viking, 1969) -- PDF\n\n\n                                == SHORT STORIES ==\n\n* Last Word &amp; Other Stories, The (Reinhardt, 1990) -- PDF\n* May We Borrow Your Husband?
