As the cops of Los Angeles drink, talk and dance into the June afternoon, he notices a heart-stoppingly beautiful woman. When Bert kisses Beverly Keating, his hostâ€™s wife, the new baby pressed between them, he sets in motion the joining of two families whose shared fate will be defined on a day seven years later.\r\nIn 1988, Franny Keating, now twenty-four, has dropped out of law school and is working as a cocktail waitress in Chicago. When she meets one of her idols, the famous author Leon Posen, and tells him about her family, she unwittingly relinquishes control over their story. Franny never dreams that the consequences of this encounter will extend beyond her own life into those of her scattered siblings and parents.\r\nTold with equal measures of humour and heartbreak, Commonwealth is a powerful and tender tale of family, betrayal and the far-reaching bonds of love and responsibility. A meditation on inspiration, interpretation and the ownership of stories, it is Ann Patchettâ€™s most astonishing work to date.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de1d39c3f1d3915a80d34b9f3bdca9953c7f5682","amp;dn":"Commonwealth+-+Ann+Patchett+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de1d39c3f1d3915a80d34b9f3bdca9953c7f5682","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,29,57,195,241,211,145,90,128,211,75,159,59,220,169,149,60,127,86,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
