The group's leader since the beginning has always been tenor saxophonist Emilio Castillo, who was born in Detroit, but opted to pursue his musical dreams in Oakland, CA. It was in Oakland that Castillo put together a group called the Motowns, which as its name suggested, specialized in '60s-era soul. Castillo teamed up with a baritone sax player (and Motowns fan) Stephen &quot;Doc&quot; Kupka, and soon the Motowns had transformed into Tower of Power (one of the first tunes the duo penned together was &quot;You're Still a Young Man,&quot; which would eventually go on to be one of the TOP's signature compositions).\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tSoul and R&amp;B\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.You Got To Funkifize\n02.What Happend To The World That Day\n03.Down The Nightclub\n04.You're Still A Young Man\n05.What Is Hip\n06.So Very Hard To Go\n07.This Time It's Real\n08.Will I Ever Find  A Love\n09.Soul Vaccination\n10.Time Will Tell\n11.Below Us All The City Lights\n12.Don't Change Horses (In The Middle Of A Stream)\n13.Willing To Learn\n14.Only So Much Oil In The Ground\n15.I Won't Leave Unless You Want Me To\n16.You're So Wonderful So Marvelous\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47a08ee11acc7168561a35518b5a1fc08e3de01e","amp;dn":"Tower+Of+Power+-+The+Very+Best+Of+%282001%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47a08ee11acc7168561a35518b5a1fc08e3de01e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,160,142,225,26,204,113,104,86,26,53,81,139,90,31,192,142,61,224,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
