Hackers are concentrating their efforts on web-based applications - shopping carts, forms, login pages, dynamic content, etc. Web applications are accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and control valuable data since they often have direct access to back-end data such as customer databases.\n\nAny defence at network security level will provide no protection against web application attacks since they are launched on port 80 - which has to remain open. In addition, web applications are often tailor-made therefore tested less than off-the-shelf software and are more likely to have undiscovered vulnerabilities. Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner automatically checks your web applications for SQL Injection, XSS &amp; other web vulnerabilities.\n\n \n\nInstructions:\n\n1) Run the installer\n2) Switch Activation.exe and wvs.exe with the ones included in this rar\n3) Run Activation.exe register with any personal information\n4) Launch wvs.exe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:799beea41165c2ff1ba8cb392c1f44ed05e9bfe1","amp;dn":"Acunetix+Vulnerability+Scanner+9.5+Cracked+%5BarMa%5D+%5BDL+Fixed%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"799beea41165c2ff1ba8cb392c1f44ed05e9bfe1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,155,238,164,17,101,194,255,27,168,203,57,44,31,68,237,5,233,191,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
