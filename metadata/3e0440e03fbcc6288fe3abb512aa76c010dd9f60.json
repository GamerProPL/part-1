Born September 26, 1945, in Washington, England, Ferry, the son of a coal miner, began his musical career as a singer with the rock outfit the Banshees while studying art at the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne under pop conceptualist Richard Hamilton. He later joined the Gas Board, a soul group featuring bassist Graham Simpson; in 1970, Ferry and Simpson formed Roxy Music.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Virginia Plain\n02.A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\n03.Pyjamarama\n04.Do The Strand\n05.These Foolish Things\n06.Street Life\n07.Let's Stick Together\n08.Smoke Gets In Your Eyes\n09.Love Is The Drug\n10.Sign Of The Times\n11.Dance Away\n12.Angel Eyes\n13.Oh Yeah\n14.Over You\n15.Same Old Scene\n16.In The Midnight Hour\n17.More Than This\n18.Avalon\n19.Slave To Love\n20.Jealous Guy\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e0440e03fbcc6288fe3abb512aa76c010dd9f60","amp;dn":"Bryan+Ferry+%26+Roxy+Music+-+20+Greatest+Hits+%281989%29+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e0440e03fbcc6288fe3abb512aa76c010dd9f60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,4,64,224,63,188,198,40,143,227,171,181,18,170,118,192,16,221,159,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
