On visits to the great cities of Europe - monumental Rome; the intellectually explosive Paris of Peter Abelard and Thomas Aquinas; the hotbed of scientific study that was Oxford; and the incomparable Florence of Dante and Giotto - acclaimed historian Thomas Cahill brilliantly captures the spirit of experimentation, the colorful pageantry, and the passionate pursuit of knowledge that built the foundations for the modern world.\r\n\r\nâ€œIntoxicating... Cahill's command of rich historical detail makes medieval cities and their colorful characters come to alive.â€\r\nâ€”The Los Angeles Times\r\n\r\nâ€œCahill offers a fascinating portrayal of the intellectual richness that foreshadows the coming Renaissance...
