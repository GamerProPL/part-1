Ironically, the band's roots lay in Detroit, where they formed as a doo wop group during the late '50s. Throughout the '60s, the Spinners tried to land a hit by adapting to the shifting fashions of R&amp;B and pop. By the mid-'60s, they had signed with Motown Records, but the label never gave the group much consideration. &quot;It's a Shame&quot; became a hit in 1970, but the label continued to ignore the group, and dropped the band two years later. Unsigned and featuring new lead singer Phillipe Wynne, the Spinners seemed destined to never break into the big leagues, but they managed to sign with Atlantic Records, where they began working with producer Thom Bell. With his assistance, the Spinners developed a distinctive sound, one that relied on Wynne's breathtaking falsetto and the group's intricate vocal harmonies. Bell provided the group with an appropriately detailed production, creating a detailed web of horns, strings, backing vocals, and lightly funky rhythms. Between 1972 and 1977, the Spinners and Bell recorded a number of soul classics, including &quot;I'll Be Around,&quot; &quot;Could It Be I'm Fallin in Love,&quot; &quot;Mighty Love,&quot; &quot;Ghetto Child,&quot; &quot;Then Came You,&quot; &quot;Games People Play,&quot; and &quot;The Rubberband Man.&quot; Wynne left in 1977 and the Spinners had hits for a few years after his departure, but the group will always be remembered for its classic mid-'70s work.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tSoul and R&amp;B\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n\nDisc 1\n01.It's A Shame\n02.I'll Be Around\n03.How Could I Let You Get Away\n04.Could It Be I'm Falling In Love\n05.I Could Never (Repay Your Love)\n06.One Of A Kind (Love Affair)\n07.Don't Let The Green Grass Fool You\n08.Ghetto Child\n09.Mighty Love\n10.I'm Coming Home\n11.Then Came You (With Dionne Warwick)\n12.Love Don't Love Nobody\n13.Since I Been Gone\n14.I've Got To Make It On My Own\n15.Living A Little Laughing A Little\n\nDisc 2\n01.They Just Can't Stop It (The Games People Play)\n02.Sadie\n03.I Don't Want To Lose You\n04.Love Or Leave\n05.Honest I Do\n06.Wake Up Susan\n07.The Rubberband Man\n08.You're Throwing A Good Love Away\n09.Me And My Music\n10.Heaven On Earth (So Fine)\n11.Easy Come Easy Go\n12.If You Wanna Do A Dance (All Night)\n13.Are You Ready For Love\n14.Working My Way Back To YouForgive Me Girl\n15.Cupid/I've Loved You For A Long Time\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a4d61aa528e660794fcc33fab0990ba4ccaf697","amp;dn":"The+Spinners+-+Definitive+Soul+Collection+%282006%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a4d61aa528e660794fcc33fab0990ba4ccaf697","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,77,97,170,82,142,102,7,148,252,195,63,171,9,144,186,76,202,246,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
