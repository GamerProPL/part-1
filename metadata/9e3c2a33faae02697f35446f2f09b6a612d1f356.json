Undoubtedly, these three figures did much to shape the group's sound, but throughout their career, the Yardbirds were very much a unit, albeit a rather unstable one. And they were truly one of the great rock bands; one whose contributions went far beyond the scope of their half dozen or so mid-'60s hits (&quot;For Your Love,&quot; &quot;Heart Full of Soul,&quot; &quot;Shapes of Things,&quot; &quot;I'm a Man,&quot; &quot;Over Under Sideways Down,&quot; &quot;Happenings Ten Years Time Ago&quot;). Not content to limit themselves to the R&amp;B and blues covers they concentrated upon initially, they quickly branched out into moody, increasingly experimental pop/rock. The innovations of Clapton, Beck, and Page redefined the role of the guitar in rock music, breaking immense ground in the use of feedback, distortion, and amplification with finesse and breathtaking virtuosity. With the arguable exception of the Byrds, they did more than any other outfit to pioneer psychedelia, with an eclectic, risk-taking approach that laid the groundwork for much of the hard rock and progressive rock from the late '60s to the present. \n\nFormed: 1963 in Surrey, England\n\nDisbanded: Jul 1968 in London, England\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n1.
