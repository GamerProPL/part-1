The great epidemics of the past â€“ famine, plague and war â€“ no longer control our lives. We are the only species in history that has single-handedly changed the entire planet, and we can no longer blame a higher being for our fate.\r\nBut as our gods take a back seat, and Homo Sapiens becomes Homo Deus, what are we going to do with ourselves? How do we set the agenda for our own future without pushing our species â€“ and the rest of the world â€“ beyond its limits?\r\nIn this vivid, challenging new book from the author of Sapiens, Yuval Noah Harari examines the implications of our newly upgraded condition, from our dogged pursuit of status and happiness to our constant quest to overcome death by pushing the boundaries of science. He explores how Homo Sapiens conquered the world, our creation of todayâ€™s human-centred environment, our current predicament and our possible future. And, above all, he asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers?\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1d04586726e21c8cbe877a8a2ab5d0acf98539e","amp;dn":"Homo+Deus+-+Yuval+Noah+Harari+%5BEN+EPUB%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1d04586726e21c8cbe877a8a2ab5d0acf98539e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,208,69,134,114,110,33,200,203,232,119,168,162,171,93,10,207,152,83,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
