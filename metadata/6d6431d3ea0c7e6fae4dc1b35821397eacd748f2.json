Best-selling author Andrew Collins has uncovered an astronomy that is about 17,000 years old, with standing stones, temples, and monuments across the globe oriented towards Cygnusâ€™s stars. He also found that the use of deep caves by Palaeolithic man led to the rise of religious thought and the belief in lifeâ€™s stellar origins. Now modern-day technology has confirmed that high-energy particles come from a binary star known as Cygnus X3. Ancient people knew what science is finally verifying: that the DNA of life came originally from deep space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d6431d3ea0c7e6fae4dc1b35821397eacd748f2","amp;dn":"The+Cygnus+Mystery%3A+The+Ancient+Secret+of+Life%27s+Origins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d6431d3ea0c7e6fae4dc1b35821397eacd748f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,100,49,211,234,12,126,111,174,77,193,179,88,33,57,126,172,215,72,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
