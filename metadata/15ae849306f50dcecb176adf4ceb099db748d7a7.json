The move paid off immediately, as they scored four Top Ten hits from Heart, their first record for the label: &quot;What About Love?,&quot; &quot;Never,&quot; &quot;These Dreams,&quot; and &quot;Nothin' at All.&quot; Heart kept up their hot streak for several more years, reaching the Top Ten three other times with the number one hit &quot;Alone,&quot; &quot;Who Will You Run To,&quot; and &quot;All I Wanna Do Is Make Love to You.&quot; All of those songs are on Greatest Hits 1985-1995, along with 11 other tracks, including the semi-rarities of the Ann Wilson and Robin Zander duet &quot;Surrender to Me&quot; and the &quot;studio version&quot; of &quot;You're the Voice.&quot; It may run a little long for the more casual fans, but overall, this is an excellent overview of the era, perfect for fans that don't need the full-length studio albums.\nAll Music Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine  \n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] What About Love\n[02] If Looks Could Kill\n[03] Never\n[04] These Dreams\n[05] Nothin' At All\n[06] Alone\n[07] Who Will You Run To\n[08] There's The Girl\n[09] Surrender To Me\n[10] All I Wanna Do Is Make Love To You\n[11] I Didn't Want To Need You\n[12] Tall, Dark Handsome Stranger\n[13] Stranded\n[14] You're The Voice\n[15] Back To Avalon\n[16] Black On Black II\n[17] Will You Be There (In The Morning)\n[18] The Road Home\n\nCD Play Time - 01h:12m:47s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 176mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
