If I messed something up, let me know, politely (preferably). So I spent some time on here, browsing The Mountain Goats, and I noticed some uploaders claiming to a discography per TMG. They were, in fact, not even close to being discographies, like, not in the least. So, I decided to spend some time and hunt down and organize everything they've released(and a little bit that wasn't), to the best of my knowledge. This is what I came up with. PLEASE let me know if I'm missing something. Oh, and also the sources were all different, and generally anonymous, so thank you to whomever provided me with said files. Being that they came from multiple sources, they are in some different file types, but they are all good quality.\n\nCassette Releases[1991-1994]:\nTaboo VI: The Homecoming\nThe Hound Chronicles\nTransmissions to Horace\nHot Garden Stomp\nTaking the Dative\nYam, the King of Crops\n\nStudio Albums[1994-2011]:\nZopilote Machine\nSweden\nNothing for Juice\nFull Force Galesburg\nThe Coroner's Gambit\nAll Hail West Texas\nTallahassee\nWe Shall All Be Healed\nThe Sunset Tree(Including Come, Come to the Sunset Tree)\nGet Lonely\nHeretic Pride\nThe Life of the World to Come\nAll Eternals Deck\n\nEPs/Singles[1992-2009]:\nSongs for Petronius\nChile de ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½rbol\nBeautiful Rat Sunset\nPhilyra\nWhy You All So Thief?\nOrange Raja, Blood Royal\nSongs for Peter Hughes\nSongs About Fire\nNine Black Poppies\nTropical Depression EP\nNew Asian Cinema\nIsopanisad Radio Hour\nOn Juhu Beach\nDevil in the Shortwave\nJam Eater Blues\nSee America Right\nPalmcorder Yajna\nLetter from Belgium\nDilaudid EP\nBabylon Springs EP\nSatanic Messiah\nBlack Pear Tree EP\nMoon Colony Bloodbath\n\nCompilation Albums['99, '02]:\nBitter Melon Farm\nProtein Source of the Future...NOW!\nGhana\n\nUnreleased['95, '96]:\nHail and Farewell, Gothenburg\nJack and Faye","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:034656149d65ac7ed67d2b3ab43f8cc2261ef35f","amp;dn":"The+Mountain+Goats+Discography+-+COMPLETE%21%28I+do+believe%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"034656149d65ac7ed67d2b3ab43f8cc2261ef35f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,70,86,20,157,101,172,126,214,125,43,58,180,63,140,194,38,30,243,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
