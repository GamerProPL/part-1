The band, consisting of CapÃ¢â‚¬â„¢n Jazz/Joan of Arc alumni Mike Kinsella as well as guitarist Steve Holmes and drummer Steve Lamos, played only a few live dates before devolving into a recording project and then silently disappearing altogether around 2000. Apart from a three-song EP, their self-titled 1999 album was all the trio left behind, its nine songs exploring a hushed, thoughtful take on the often more aggressive tones of the hardcore-birthed emo scene. American FootballÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs dig deep into uncommon time signatures and jazz-influenced chords, and even implement understated trumpet and electric piano into their web of interlocking guitar runs and muted, softly smiling vocals. Happening concordantly with a thriving post-rock movement hubbed close by in Chicago, the band has hints of the same musical crosscurrents of Tortoise or Gastr del Sol, setting their songs apart from the flock. The airy riff in 3/4 time and KinsellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s buried, eager vocals on opening song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Never MeantÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ set the tone for an album of soft-spoken yet high-spirited songs not quite like any of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s emo contemporaries. The band seemed primarily focused on instrumental composition, with fully instrumental tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Know I Should Be Leaving SoonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The One with the WurlitzerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ standing out and vocals sounding like a floating, distanced element on many of the tunes that include them. The lilting, mysterious tone of the album is only occasionally broken up by an upbeat rocker like Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll See You When WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Both Not So Emotional,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ where the band marries its jazz-influenced chops to the same kind of wide-eyed emo pop the Promise Ring was making at the time. Kinsella would go on to release solo material as Owen, drawing on the same soft-focus melodies he employed with American Football, but the collaborative magic he found with Holmes and Lamos would never quite be recaptured in any of the threeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future projects. Every song here manages to sound meticulously constructed without diminishing the easy, often dreamlike feel of the album. The record is defined by a sense of possibility and youthful discovery, and stands out not just as an anomalistic emo-jazz hybrid but as a lasting, iconic statement in the often blurry history of independent music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c325605b1ea5f993b0d667a941ca8f4c691f1a5c","amp;dn":"American+Football+-+American+Football+%5BDeluxe+Edition%5D+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c325605b1ea5f993b0d667a941ca8f4c691f1a5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,37,96,91,30,165,249,147,176,214,103,169,65,202,143,76,105,31,26,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
