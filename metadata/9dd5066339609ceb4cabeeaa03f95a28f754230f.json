I got into the scene when I was impressed by a certain group who would upload watchable movies with reasonable file sizes. I felt this idea could be improved on and proceeded to try it out myself. My goal is to produce the highest quality watchable versions of a movie while maintaining a reasonable file size. This means you may find higher quality out there, but file sizes may be two, four, even five times as large as those of mine. Or, you may find much smaller file sizes out there, but the quality will be severely lacking.\n\nI believe my encodes are some of the best quality-wise, while maintaining a reasonable file size. While I consider myself a fledgling encoder, I take my time and make sure when choosing encode settings to preview from a variety of scenes; low light, people of various skin color or age, distance or close up shots, one target in-frame the other out of frame, etc. I look at all these things when deciding upon a custom coding value for each show/movie. Once decided, an entire season is encoded the same way. Each movie I upload is uniquely encoded.\n\nDisclaimer: As I mostly only encode, and rarely rip, my sources are you - those on the pirate bay who do original uploads. Thank you for providing for the rest of us. I apologize I don't also include your names here, but there are too many to track. Sometimes there are multiple sources to complete a season. I sincerely hope you know who you are. This said, my encodes are limited to source material at hand. So if one particular season of a show is only uploaded in 2 channel stereo and that's what I had at the time of encoding.. that's what it ends up being. Although later files in the series may end up 6 channel, depending on who uploaded what at the time I downloaded. I try to maintain a constant source when possible. Media info is always from the first episode in any series. I encourage you to try my torrents out and if you are displeased you can always delete, but I feel you will be very satisfied with your download.\n\nThank you, please enjoy the screenshots which are actual shots from VLC of my encodes. Provide feedback if you like, and perhaps I will upload more. I've been at this a while and I wanted to give something back to the community.\n\n-Chupacabra\n\n\n*****************************************************************************\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dd5066339609ceb4cabeeaa03f95a28f754230f","amp;dn":"Game+of+Thrones+1080p+Season+4+COMPLETE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dd5066339609ceb4cabeeaa03f95a28f754230f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,213,6,99,57,96,156,235,76,171,238,170,3,249,90,40,247,84,35,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
