Active during the 1990s, Sleep earned much critical and record label attention from early in their career. Critic Ed Rivadavia describes them as &quot;perhaps the ultimate stoner rock band&quot; and notes they exerted a strong influence on heavy metal in the '90s. However, squabbles with their record company had contributed to Sleep's breakup by the end of the decade.\n\nSleep is kind of like Black Sabbath meets Pantera\n\nFor all you mosh pitters and head bangers this is a must have collection\n\nRipped by Jazinator in high quality 320Kbps Lossy MP3(dB Poweramp)\n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26e6851ef4753552662526fc10d9d83ba1d0c2ba","amp;dn":"Sleep-Compilation+%28Volume+1%2C+1991%29+%26+%28Holy+Mountain%2C+1992%29+320+k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26e6851ef4753552662526fc10d9d83ba1d0c2ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,230,133,30,244,117,53,82,102,37,38,252,16,217,216,59,161,208,194,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
