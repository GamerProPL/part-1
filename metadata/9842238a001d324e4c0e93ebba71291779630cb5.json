(Deluxe Edition)\r\nYear Of Release: 2016\r\nLabel: Rhino\r\nGenre: Classic Rock, Pop, Oldies\r\nQuality: 320 \r\nTotal Time: 43:26\r\nTotal Size: 104 mb\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Monkees are ready to have some fun this year as the iconic band celebrates its 50th anniversary with a tour and the groupâ€™s first new album in 20 years, appropriately titled GOOD TIMES!.\r\n\r\nThe album features all three surviving band members â€“ Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork. The unmistakable voice of the late Davy Jones is also included with a vintage vocal featured on one song. To produce the new album, the band found the perfect musical co-conspirator in Grammy and Emmy-winning songwriter Adam Schlesinger (Fountains Of Wayne, Ivy).\r\n\r\nMuch like The Monkeesâ€™ early albums, GOOD TIMES! features tracks written specifically for the band by some of the music worldâ€™s most gifted songwriters, including Rivers Cuomo (Weezer), Ben Gibbard (Death Cab For Cutie), Andy Partridge (XTC), and Zach Rogue (Rogue Wave) as well as a song co-written by Noel Gallagher and Paul Weller. The album also includes songwriting contributions by Nesmith (â€œI Know What I Knowâ€) and Tork as well as producer Schlesinger.\r\n\r\nTo help bring the anniversary full circle, the group completed songs for that were originally recorded and written for the group during the 60s, including â€œLove To Loveâ€ by Neil Diamond, which features a vintage vocal by Jones. Harry Nilsson wrote the title track â€œGood Times!â€ which he recorded at a session with Nesmith in January 1968.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.Good Times\r\n2.You Bring the Summer\r\n3.She Makes Me Laugh\r\n4.Our Own World\r\n5.Gotta Give It Time\r\n6.Me &amp; Magdalena\r\n7.Whatever's Right\r\n8.Love to Love\r\n9.Little Girl\r\n10.Birth of an Accidental Hipster\r\n11.Wasn't Born to Follow\r\n12.I Know What I Know\r\n13.I Was There (And I'm Told I Had a Good Time)\r\n\r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/a0gm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9842238a001d324e4c0e93ebba71291779630cb5","amp;dn":"The+Monkees+-+Good+Times%21+%28Deluxe+Edition%29+%282016%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9842238a001d324e4c0e93ebba71291779630cb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,66,35,138,0,29,50,78,76,14,147,235,186,113,41,23,121,99,12,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
