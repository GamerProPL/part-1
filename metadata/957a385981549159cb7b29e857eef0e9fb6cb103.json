I got this from Rutracker. No encrypted passwords or hassles with NI service center. Just drop the folder into your NI Kontakt library directory and then add it too Kontakt. Working on my PC right now just fine and it should work on MAC as well. Like a couple other things from OutPut the samples seem big and it will take a few minutes to load it the first time. Do not panic. It will load then you need to resave the library so it will load faster the next time. \r\n\r\nI do not think I need to copy paste specs and stuff. Just download it and have some fun. \r\n\r\nI am not the ripper and takes to the comrade at Rutracker who shared this. \r\n\r\n\r\nI will continue to seed until I have had it and then it is up to others to keep it alive. I am not online 24/7. If I vanish fear not I will be back and let it run until it is alive and seeding. \r\n\r\nUW","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:957a385981549159cb7b29e857eef0e9fb6cb103","amp;dn":"Output+-+Exhale+%28KONTAKT%29+-Rutracker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"957a385981549159cb7b29e857eef0e9fb6cb103","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,122,56,89,129,84,145,89,203,123,41,232,87,238,240,233,251,108,177,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
