Trine shatters. With a literally heartless ancient sorcerer on the loose, and only a broken artifact to guide them, the heroes must try and repair the damage they've caused... or the damage that might yet be done.\nTrine 3: The Artifacts of Power is a fairytale journey which takes you on a quest with three heroes: Amadeus the Wizard, Pontius the Knight, and Zoya the Thief.\nThis tale of a grand adventure as well as the additional challenge levels provide true tests to the three heroes' skills in combat and of solving puzzles in the most creative ways.\nPlayable either in singleplayer, and with friends online or in local co-op.\nOnline and Local Co-op - Up to three players can play online and local co-up. Any mix is possible (for example 2 local, 1 online) and you can switch from singleplayer to multiplayer and vice versa. Play with your friends and explore the secrets together!\nChallenge Levels - The ultimate test to your skills, the Challenge Levels feature the most incredible contraptions, character-driven design, and ridiculous puzzles. Collect experience shards to unlock more Challenge Levels.\nSoundtrack - Award-winning composer Ari Pulkkinen returns for an amazing fantasy soundtrack! The feels, man.\nFantastic Fantasy - Adventure through breathtakingly beautiful landscapes in an enchanting fairytale world, and for the first time ever explore the Trine world in a full 3D setting, allowing you to go check out all the nooks and crannies that have been so alluring in the past.\n\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Windows Vista / 7 / 8\nProcessor: Intel Core i3/i5/i7 2.0 GHz CPU dual-core or 3.0 GHz AMD CPU\nMemory: 4 GB RAM\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce 260 / Radeon HD 4000 Series\nDirectX: Version 10\nHard Drive: 5 GB available space\nMouse, Keyboard\n\nRecommended system requirements - Windows: Windows Vista / 7 / 8\nProcessor: Quad-core or over 3-4 GHz dual-core\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750 Ti 2GB / Radeon R9 270 2GB\nDirectX: Version 10\nHard Drive: 5 GB available space\nMouse, Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:143c275ed23b93cdd8df679385a25e848bdf79f9","amp;dn":"Trine+3%3A+The+Artifacts+of+Power+Early+Access+%28v0.09%29+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"143c275ed23b93cdd8df679385a25e848bdf79f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,60,39,94,210,59,147,205,216,223,103,147,133,162,94,132,139,223,121,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
