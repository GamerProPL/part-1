She commiserates with her best friend Pash (Alia Shawkat) at their waitressing jobs. Pash has a plan to get out: she is applying to Ivy League schools. Bliss just wants to get out and needs a plan and a calling. She finds it during a shopping trip to Austin, Texas where she picks up a flyer for a Roller Derby event, schemes to attend, gets invited to try out and becomes Babe Ruthless, her alter-ego roller derby character. She makes the team, lies about her age, works hard to succeed, experiences her first love with the young lead singer of an Indie rock band, gets disappointed in love, bonds with her new family of roller derby girls, fights with her mother to escape the beauty pageant and live her new dream as roller derby star. She manages to reconcile all of this, impress and win over her parents and friends, and charts an ambiguous goal to move to Austin, continue with Roller Derby, and live her new life.\n\nVideo\n\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 50mn\nBit rate : 768 Kbps\nWidth : 656 pixels\nHeight : 256 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.563\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nResolution : 8 bits\nColorimetry : 4:2:0\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.191\n\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo / MS Stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 50mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 103 Kbps\nNominal bit rate : 112 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af230bd751f8d42c08278b471eb4e9ec8437fe53","amp;dn":"whip+It+%282009%29+DvdRip+%5BXvid%5D+%7B1337x%7D-X.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af230bd751f8d42c08278b471eb4e9ec8437fe53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,35,11,215,81,248,212,44,8,39,139,71,30,180,233,236,132,55,254,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
