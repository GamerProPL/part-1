It recounts the struggle of Spiegelman&amp;#039;s father to survive the Holocaust as a Polish Jew and draws largely on his father&amp;#039;s recollections of his experiences. The book also follows the author&amp;#039;s troubled relationship with his father and the way the effects of war reverberate through generations of a family. In 1992 it won a Pulitzer Prize Special Award. The New York Times described the selection of Maus for the honor: &quot;The Pulitzer board members ... found the cartoonist&amp;#039;s depiction of Nazi Germany hard to classify.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42760b71c9a6f472dd544ab8cbf15d0564222ab7","amp;dn":"Art+Spiegelman%3A+Maus+-+A+Survivor%5C%27s+Tale","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42760b71c9a6f472dd544ab8cbf15d0564222ab7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,118,11,113,201,166,244,114,221,84,74,184,203,241,93,5,100,34,42,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
