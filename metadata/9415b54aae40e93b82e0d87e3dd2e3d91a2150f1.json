A double album on vinyl, Yeti consists of a set of structured songs and a second disc of improvisations.  \nA stoner krautrock gem with fuzztone guitars, witchy vocals, sinister violin sounds, groovy ambient noises, psychedelic guitar solos and dynamic drum work.\nBritish avant-garde music magazine The Wire describes Yeti as &quot;one of the cornerstones of both Amon DÃƒÂ¼ÃƒÂ¼l's career and the entire Krautrock movement.&quot; \n\n\n\n\nNote: Krautrock is a German avant-garde / experimental rock movement that emerged at the end of the 1960's. The term krautrock was originally a humorous one coined by the UK music press (such as New Musical Express and Melody Maker), where &quot;krautrock&quot; found an early and enthusiastic underground following. \nJulian Cope, in his book Krautrocksampler, says &quot;Krautrock is a subjective British phenomenon,&quot; based on the way the music was received in the UK rather than on the actual West German music scene out of which it grew.  The term is also a problematic category due to the considerable differences between the artists so labelled.\nKey artists associated with the tag include Can, Amon DÃƒÂ¼ÃƒÂ¼l II, Ash Ra Tempel, Faust, Popol Vuh, Cluster, Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, Neu!, and Kraftwerk.\n\n\n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9415b54aae40e93b82e0d87e3dd2e3d91a2150f1","amp;dn":"Amon+Duul+II+-+Yeti+1970+%2F+2006+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9415b54aae40e93b82e0d87e3dd2e3d91a2150f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,21,181,74,174,64,233,59,130,224,216,126,61,210,227,217,26,33,80,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
