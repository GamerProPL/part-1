The album contained all original compositions, almost none of which were in common time. Nonetheless, on the strength of these unusual time signatures (the album included &quot;Take Five&quot;, &quot;Blue Rondo ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  la Turk&quot;, and &quot;Pick Up Sticks&quot;, it quickly went platinum.\n\nTrack Listing:\n1.) Blue Rondo ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  la Turk\n2.) Strange Meadow Lark\n3.) Take Five\n4.) Three to get Ready\n5.) Kathy's Waltz\n6.) Everybody's Jumpin'\n7.)
