Gorse\nWiley-Blackwell | June 2014 | ISBN-10: 1118255496 | True PDF | 580 pages | 41.5 mb\n\nRobin Barry's Construction of Buildings was first published in 1958 in 5 volumes, rapidly becoming a standard text on construction. In its current 2 volume format Barry remains hugely popular with both students and lecturers of construction and related disciplines.\nThe third edition of Barry's Advanced Construction of Buildings expands and deepens your understanding of construction technology. It covers the construction of larger-scale buildings (primarily residential, commercial and industrial) constructed with load bearing frames, supported by chapters on fit-out and second fix, lifts and escalators, off-site construction and a new chapter on building obsolescence and revitalisation. Functional and performance requirements of the main building elements are emphasised throughout, as is building efficiency and meeting the challenges of limiting the environmental impact of buildings. You will find the text fully up to date with the latest building regulations and construction technologies.\nThe new edition, with supporting material at www.wiley.com/go/barrysintroduction, is an ideal information source for developing a wider and deeper understanding of construction technology.\n\nAbout the Authors\nStephen Emmitt BA(Hons), Dip.
