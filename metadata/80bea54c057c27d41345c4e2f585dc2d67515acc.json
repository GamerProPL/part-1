Machiavelli was for many years an official in the Florentine Republic, with responsibilities in diplomatic and military affairs.  He was a founder of modern political science, and more specifically political ethics.\n\nIn addition to many lesser known works, two key texts of political history and philosophy are included: \n\nMachiavelli's  masterpiece, THE PRINCE, was written in 1513 after the Medici had recovered power and he no longer held a position of responsibility in Florence.  It was not published until 1532, five years after Machiavelli's death.  The treatise is not representative of the work published during his lifetime, but it is the most remembered and the work responsible for bringing &quot;Machiavellian&quot; into wide usage as a pejorative term.  Six translations are provided here (Gilbert, Wootton, Bondanella, Atkinson, Constantine, and Mansfield).\n\nThe DISCOURSES ON LIVY was written ca. 1517 but only published posthumously with papal privilege in 1531.  There are 4 translations here (Gilbert, Wootton, Thomson, and Mansfield &amp; Tarcov).\n\nMachiavelli also wrote comedies, here represented by THE WOMAN FROM ANDROS, THE MANDRAKE, and CLIZIA.  Finally, his personal correspondence is renowned in the Italian language.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format, except for THE ESSENTIAL WRITINGS (epub):\n\n* THE CHIEF WORKS AND OTHERS, VOL.
