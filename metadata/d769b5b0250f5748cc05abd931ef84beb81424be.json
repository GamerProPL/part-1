During the filming process in 2012, the story abruptly took a dramatic turn. The band was brought into a Kafkaesque nightmare, when lead singer Randy Blythe was arrested on charges of manslaughter - blamed for the death of one of their young fans in the Czech Republic. What followed was a heart-wrenching courtroom drama that left fans, friends, and curious onlookers around the world on the edge of their seats.\n\n\n--------------------------\nReleased: 3/6/2014\nLenght: 90min\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d769b5b0250f5748cc05abd931ef84beb81424be","amp;dn":"Lamb.Of.God.As.The.Palaces.Burn.2014.WEB-wbzz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d769b5b0250f5748cc05abd931ef84beb81424be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,105,181,176,37,15,87,72,204,5,171,217,49,239,132,190,184,20,36,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
