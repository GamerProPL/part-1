Brett - The Daylight War (Demon Cycle, Book 03)\n\nFORMATS: EPUB and MOBI\n\nAlso included in this torrent - BOOKS 1 and 2 + MAP\n\n\n\nThe Daylight War: Book Three of The Demon Cycle - \n\n\nWith The Warded Man and The Desert Spear, Peter V. Brett surged to the front rank of contemporary fantasy, standing alongside giants in the field such as George R. R. Martin, Robert Jordan, and Terry Brooks. The Daylight War, the eagerly anticipated third volume in BrettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s internationally bestselling Demon Cycle, continues the epic tale of humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last stand against an army of demons that rise each night to prey on mankind.\n \nOn the night of the new moon, the demons rise in force, seeking the deaths of two men, both of whom have the potential to become the fabled Deliverer, the man prophesied to reunite the scattered remnants of humanity in a final push to destroy the demon corelings once and for all.\n \nArlen Bales was once an ordinary man, but now he has become something moreÃ¢â‚¬â€the Warded Man, tattooed with eldritch wards so powerful they make him a match for any demon. Arlen denies he is the Deliverer at every turn, but the more he tries to be one with the common folk, the more fervently they believe. Many would follow him, but ArlenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s path threatens to lead to a dark place he alone can travel to, and from which there may be no returning.\n \nThe only one with hope of keeping Arlen in the world of men, or joining him in his descent into the world of demons, is Renna Tanner, a fierce young woman in danger of losing herself to the power of demon magic.\n \nAhmann Jardir has forged the warlike desert tribes of Krasia into a demon-killing army and proclaimed himself SharÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Dama Ka, the Deliverer. He carries ancient weaponsÃ¢â‚¬â€a spear and a crownÃ¢â‚¬â€that give credence to his claim, and already vast swaths of the green lands bow to his control.\n \nBut Jardir did not come to power on his own. His rise was engineered by his First Wife, Inevera, a cunning and powerful priestess whose formidable demon bone magic gives her the ability to glimpse the future. IneveraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s motives and past are shrouded in mystery, and even Jardir does not entirely trust her.\n \nOnce Arlen and Jardir were as close as brothers. Now they are the bitterest of rivals. As humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enemies rise, the only two men capable of defeating them are divided against each other by the most deadly demons of allÃ¢â‚¬â€those lurking in the human heart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:902ad2609252a79acadfa929fb67c2447fc45f7e","amp;dn":"Peter+V.+Brett+-+%5BDemon+Cycle+03%5D+-+The+Daylight+War+%28EPUB%2FMOBI%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"902ad2609252a79acadfa929fb67c2447fc45f7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,42,210,96,146,82,167,154,202,223,169,41,251,103,194,68,127,196,95,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
