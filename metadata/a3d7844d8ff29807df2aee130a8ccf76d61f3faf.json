Starting off as a gimmick for the Armin Only n Intense world tour, its musical and visual impact gave it a crowd favourite status in no time. Due to popular demand, the song that was made in merely 2 days, now sees its release. Its big, bold and playful n ePing Pong is bouncing your way. Who could have guessed, that a song created about the most retro game in existence, ePong, would blow up into a 2014 EDM phenomenon in its own right? It all goes back to a childhood love of video games and a fascination with a little white ball bouncing around a low-res TV screen. PingO PongO PingO PongO The biggest fires start from the tiniest spark, and before long, the ePing Pong Song grew to become one of the most unforgettable moments of the Armin Only. With the incredibly catchy drop, fans will remember the ePing Pong moments for a very long time to come.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3d7844d8ff29807df2aee130a8ccf76d61f3faf","amp;dn":"Armin+van+Buuren+-+Ping+Pong+%28Original+Mix%29+%5BArmada+Music%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3d7844d8ff29807df2aee130a8ccf76d61f3faf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,215,132,77,143,242,152,7,223,42,238,19,10,140,207,118,214,31,63,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
