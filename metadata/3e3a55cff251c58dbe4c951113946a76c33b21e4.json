I warned you!\n\nYou need a lot of patience with  this movie. Have a look at the sample before dl.\n\n\nYOU MUST READ before download:\nLOVE/HATE comments: \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111341/usercomments?filter=love&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111341/usercomments?filter=love&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111341/usercomments?filter=hate&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111341/usercomments?filter=hate&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMagyar link:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.divido.hu/index.phtml?op=product&amp;product_id=16541&amp;p=pd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.divido.hu/index.phtml?op=product&amp;product_id=16541&amp;p=pd&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIn a small dilapidated village in 1980s Hungary, life has come to a virtual standstill.\n\nThe autumn rains have started. The villagers expect to receive a large cash payment that\n\n evening, and then plan to leave. Some want to abscond earlier with more than their fair\n\n share of the money. However they hear that the smooth talking Irimias, whom they thought\n\n had died, is coming back. They are apprehensive that he will take all their money in one\n\n of his grandiose schemes to keep the community going.\n\n\nFormat                           : Matroska(mkv)\nFile size                        : 1.1GB+1GB+1.4GB=3.5GB\nDuration                         : 132min+120min+170min=422min\nOverall bit rate                 : 1200 Kbps\n\nVideo (AVC)\nNominal bit rate                 : 1 000 Kbps\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 764 x 452 (1.688)\nFrame rate                       : 25 fps\nWriting library                  : x264 core 79\n\nAudio Hungarian(Magyar) AC3, 192 KB/s, 2ch\n\nSubtitles: English, French, German\n\nSample: yes(15.5MB)\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bilderkiste.org/show/original/0130008278150/1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bilderkiste.org/show/original/0130008278150/1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bilderkiste.org/show/original/4130008280435/2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bilderkiste.org/show/original/4130008280435/2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bilderkiste.org/show/original/3130008282437/3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bilderkiste.org/show/original/3130008282437/3.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e3a55cff251c58dbe4c951113946a76c33b21e4","amp;dn":"Satantango+%281994%29+%28Eng+Fra+Ger+subs%29+%5Bmkvonly%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e3a55cff251c58dbe4c951113946a76c33b21e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,58,85,207,242,81,197,141,190,76,149,17,19,148,106,118,195,59,33,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
