Following Attila and the Huns from the steppes of Kazakhstan to the court of Constantinople, Christopher Kelly portrays Attila in a compelling new light, uncovering an unlikely marriage proposal, a long-standing relationship with a treacherous Roman general, and a thwarted assassination plot. We see Attila as both a master warrior and an astute strategist whose rule was threatening but whose sudden loss of power was even more so. The End of Empire is an original exploration of the clash between empire and barbarity in the ancient world, full of contemporary resonance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e06122b8285910cae6da6084cc848c52bb435eb","amp;dn":"The+End+of+Empire%3A+Attila+the+Hun+and+the+Fall+of+Rome","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e06122b8285910cae6da6084cc848c52bb435eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,6,18,43,130,133,145,12,174,109,166,8,76,200,72,197,43,180,53,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
