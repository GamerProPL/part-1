Instead of following in the Sugarcubes' arty guitar rock pretensions, BjÃƒÂ¶rk immersed herself in dance and club culture, working with many of the biggest names in the genre, including Nellee Hooper, Underworld, and Tricky. Debut, her first solo effort (except for an Icelandic-only smash released when she was just 11 years old), not only established her new artistic direction, but it became an international hit, making her one of the most unlikely stars of the '90s. \n\n\nGenre................: Electronic\nYear.................: 2015\nLabel.................: One Little Indian\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Folder.auCDtect\n\n\n\n01.Stonemilker\n02.Lionsong\n03.History Of Touches\n04.Black Lake\n05.Family\n06.Notget\n07.Atom Dance\n08.Mouth Mantra\n09.Quicksand\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8a0fb81a7952dd2aa263c718e0a33d61b586e8c","amp;dn":"Bj%26ouml%3Brk+-+Vulnicura+%282015%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8a0fb81a7952dd2aa263c718e0a33d61b586e8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,160,251,129,167,149,45,210,170,38,60,113,142,10,51,214,27,88,110,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
