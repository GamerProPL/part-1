While some of Moby's earlier work garnered critical and commercial success within \nthe electronic dance music scene, Play was both a critical success and a commercial phenomenon.\nThe album introduced Moby to a worldwide mainstream audience, not only through a large number of hit singles\n(that helped the album to dominate worldwide charts for two years) \nbut also through unprecedented licensing of his music in films, television,and commercial advertisements.\nIt eventually became the biggest-selling album of its genre, with over 12 million copies sold worldwide\nAccording to Rolling Stone, &quot;Play wasn't the first album to make a rock star out of an insular techno nerdnik, \nbut it was the first to make one a pop sensation.Play made post-modernism cuddly, \nslowly but surely striking a chord with critics and record-buyers alike.~\n================================================\n          Play (1999) Info\n[____________________________________]\nMoby Official: http://www.moby.com/\nReleased: May 17, (1999)\nRecorded: (1998Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1999)\nGenre: Electronica, techno, breakbeat\nLength: 63:12Min\nLabel: Little Idiot, V2, BMG, Mute\nProducer: Moby (Musical Artist)\n================================================\n       Play (1999) Musical Album\n[____________________________________]\nTracklising:\n01.- &quot;Honey&quot;\n02.- &quot;Find My Baby&quot;\n03.- &quot;Porcelain&quot; \n04.- &quot;Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?&quot;\n05.- &quot;South Side&quot;\n06.- &quot;Rushing&quot; \n07.- &quot;Bodyrock&quot; \n08.- &quot;Natural Blues&quot; \n09.- &quot;Machete&quot;\n10.- &quot;7&quot;  \t\n11.- &quot;Run On&quot;\n12.- &quot;Down Slow&quot;\n13.- &quot;If Things Were Perfect&quot;\n14.- &quot;Everloving&quot;\n15.- &quot;Inside&quot;\n16.- &quot;Guitar Flute &amp; String&quot;\n17.- &quot;The Sky is Broken&quot;\n18.- &quot;My Weakness&quot;\n===============================================\nAudio Specifications:\nPerformer____________________________: Moby\nFormat_______________________________: MPEG Audio (Mp3)\nFormat version_______________________: Version 1\nFormat profile_______________________: Layer 3\nBit rate mode________________________: Constant\nBit rate_____________________________: 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)___________________________: 2 channels\nSampling rate________________________: 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode_____________________: Lossy\n===============================================\nGreetz to all our friends from the past to present!!
