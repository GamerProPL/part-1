Triathlon training is fairly standardized, says the author, with established principles and proven methods. \n Among the rules are &quot;train for endurance&quot; (even the shortest triathlons take at least an hour for the fastest athletes to compete), \n &quot;train specifically&quot; (compartmentalize to become efficient) and &quot;rest and recover sufficiently&quot; (after a body system's been overloaded, it needs to \n return to a state of balance). Fitzgerald follows these conventions with chapters on equipment, including hydrodynamic swimsuits and \n road bikes with clip-on aerobars; swim training, with in-depth explanations of freestyle techniques; maintaining a healthy lifestyle, \n describing various stretches and how to deal with injuries; and more. He even discusses mental training, reminding readers to keep a playful attitude. \n They'll need it, especially in the grueling final stretches.\n\n PLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n &quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64926f9242de91f4b84450dbdc2bf6228bc3f0d1","amp;dn":"Triathlete+Magazine%27s+Complete+Triathlon+Book-+The+Training%2C+Die","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64926f9242de91f4b84450dbdc2bf6228bc3f0d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,146,111,146,66,222,145,244,184,68,80,219,220,43,246,34,139,195,240,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
