Each gem gives provides different abilities, letting you learn the right tools for every situation.\r\nA NEW EXPERIENCE EVERY TIME: Randomized level layouts mean that both players will be exploring fresh areas every time you play.\r\nSIMPLE CONTROLS, DEEP CHALLENGE: Controlling your spacenaut is so simple that anyone can jump in quickly, but getting both players to work together like a well-oiled machine, battling a galaxy of evil robots and constellations â€” thatâ€™s the tricky part.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10\r\nProcessor: 1.7 GHz Core 2 Duo\r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: 256 MB VRAM\r\nDirectX: Version 9.0\r\nHard Drive: 900 MB available space\r\nMouse, Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9df7fe9cbe053dc89dd5d4a2a53860ebe8cf11c3","amp;dn":"Lovers+in+a+Dangerous+Spacetime+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9df7fe9cbe053dc89dd5d4a2a53860ebe8cf11c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,247,254,156,190,5,61,200,157,213,212,162,165,56,96,235,232,207,17,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
