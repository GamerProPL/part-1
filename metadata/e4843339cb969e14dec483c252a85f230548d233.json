Instrumentally, their sound contains lush, multi-layered, \n\npsychedelic rock arrangements, but lyrically their compositions show \n\nelements of space rock, including unusual song and album titlesÃ¢â‚¬â€such as \n\n&quot;What Is the Light? (An Untested Hypothesis Suggesting That the Chemical [In \n\nOur Brains] by Which We Are Able to Experience the Sensation of Being in \n\nLove Is the Same Chemical That Caused the &quot;Big Bang&quot; That Was the Birth of \n\nthe Accelerating Universe)&quot;. They are also acclaimed for their elaborate \n\nlive shows, which feature costumes, balloons, puppets, video projections, \n\ncomplex stage light configurations, giant hands, large amounts of confetti, \n\nand frontman Wayne Coyne's signature man-sized plastic bubble, in which he \n\ntraverses the audience. In 2002, Q magazine named The Flaming Lips one of \n\nthe &quot;50 Bands to See Before You Die.&quot;\n\nThe band is best known for its associations with 1960s and 1970s psychedelic \n\nsubculture, with elements of this culture permeating the group's \n\ninstrumentation, effects, and composition. Coyne's lyrics, in particular, \n\nboth reference and embody the fascination with the science fiction and space \n\nopera genres of fiction that were popular during the golden age of \n\npsychedelic subculture.[1] His lyrical style tends to use the imagery and \n\nplot conventions of space opera to frame more abstract themes about the \n\nunfolding cycles of romantic love, highlighting its vulnerability while \n\ndelving into its metaphysical implications.[1]\n\nThe group recorded several albums and EPs on an indie label, Restless, in \n\nthe 1980s and early 1990s. After signing to Warner Brothers, they scored a \n\nhit in 1993 with &quot;She Don't Use Jelly&quot;. Although it has been their only hit \n\nsingle in the U.S., the band has maintained critical respect and, to a \n\nlesser extent, commercial viability through albums such as 1999's The Soft \n\nBulletin (which was NME magazine's Album of the Year) and 2002's Yoshimi \n\nBattles the Pink Robots. They have had more hit singles in the UK and Europe \n\nthan in the U.S. In February 2007, they were nominated for a 2007 BRIT Award \n\nin the &quot;Best International Act&quot; category. By 2007, the group garnered three \n\nGrammy Awards, including two for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flaming_Lips&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flaming_Lips&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4843339cb969e14dec483c252a85f230548d233","amp;dn":"The+Flaming+Lips+-+Discography++-+320+kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4843339cb969e14dec483c252a85f230548d233","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,132,51,57,203,150,158,20,222,196,131,194,82,168,95,35,5,72,210,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
