This third edition replaces irrelevant information, such as RMI and applets, with recipes updated for Java 8.\nJava Cookbook covers a lot of ground, and offers Java developers short, focused pieces of code that can be easily incorporated into other programs. The recipes focus on things that are useful, tricky, or both. This book also includes code segments that covers many specialized APIs, and serves as a great jumping-off place for Java developers who want to get started in areas outside of their specialization.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b6e0b632117ecaaf2435bd473c818f94804aab3","amp;dn":"Java+Cookbook+-+O%27Reilly+%282014%29+PDF+-+GOLU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b6e0b632117ecaaf2435bd473c818f94804aab3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,110,11,99,33,23,236,170,242,67,91,212,115,200,24,249,72,4,170,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
