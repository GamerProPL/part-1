It\\&amp;#039;s not an entirely instrumental album either, there are three fantastic vocal tracks, featuring Laura Darlington, Dolly and the rough honed Gonja Sufi who\\&amp;#039;s vocals sit somewhere between Captain Beefheart and Axl Rose, which show off his ability to write woozy but catchy arrangements, which mix the futuristic and the classic very neatly.\n\n-warpmart.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47bcac5c8a9e6034b510a3d7202d7d019e09afe6","amp;dn":"Flying+Lotus+-+Los+Angeles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47bcac5c8a9e6034b510a3d7202d7d019e09afe6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,188,172,92,138,158,96,52,181,16,163,215,32,45,125,1,158,9,175,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
