The roots dub classic, with the full Black Ark sound. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Super ApeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is something else.\n  \nThe music swirls around you endlessly and carries you away to a different world. All of the tracks are perfectly crafted to showcase PerryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dub sound. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Super ApeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ distinguishes itself by featuring guest performances on five tracks by vocal trio the Heptones, Prince Jazzbo on another, and the Full Experience on two cuts.\n \nBut itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the music behind the vocals thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distinctly the work of Lee Ã¢â‚¬Å“ScratchÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Perry. (Perry regularly hired the best in the country: Bassist Boris Gardiner, drummer Sly Dunbar, and guitarist Earl Smith among them). His beats seem to spill over one another, but they always land perfectly.\n \nFrom start to finish, the album is all killer, no filler. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Super ApeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an outstanding masterwork.\n\n\n\nLee Ã¢â‚¬Å“ScratchÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Perry &amp; The Upsetters\n\n\n  CD / 2004 / 320Kbps\n \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Zion's Blood \n\n2.
