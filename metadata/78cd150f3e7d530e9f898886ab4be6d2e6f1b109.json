After being unable to secure job outside of the government, Chuck rejoins the CIA without Ellie's knowledge.\nChuck and Sarah continue to have communication issues, and Chuck's search for his mother entangles him in a fight with Russian international arms dealer Alexei Volkoff (Timothy Dalton) and his far-reaching organization Volkoff Industries, whom she was assigned to infiltrate 20 years earlier.\nSarah tells Chuck that she is going undercover as a double agent to bring down Volkoff Industries and bring back Mary Bartowski. Sarah works undercover in Volkoff for a few weeks until Chuck devises a plan to take Volkoff down. With the arrest of Volkoff, the family rushes to the hospital where Ellie is in labor.\nClara Woodcomb is born as Chuck proposes to Sarah and she says yes.
