Sykes (St. Martinâ€™s Press, 2007).epub\r\n\r\nCharles J. Sykes offers fifty life lessons not included in the self-esteem-laden, reality-light curriculum of most schools. Here are truths about what kids will encounter in the world post-schooling, and ideas for how parents can reclaim lost ground---not with pep talks and touchy-feely negotiations, but with honesty and respect. Sykes's rules are frank, funny, and tough minded, including:\r\n\r\n#1 Life is not fair. Get used to it. \r\n#7 If you think your teacher is tough, wait until you get a boss. He doesn't have tenure, so he tends to be a bit edgier. When you screw up, he's not going to ask you how you FEEL about it. \r\n#15 Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity. Your grandparents had a different word for burger flipping. They called it &quot;opportunity.&quot;\r\n#42 Change the oil. \r\n#43 Don't let the success of others depress you.\r\n#48 Tell yourself the story of your life. Have a point.\r\n\r\nEach rule is explored with wise, pithy examples that parents, grandparents, and teachers can use to help children help themselves succeed---in school and out of it.\r\n\r\nA few rules kids won't learn in school:\r\n#9 Your school may have done away with winners and losers. Life hasn't.\r\n#14 Looking like a slut does not empower you.\r\n#29 Learn to deal with hypocrisy.\r\n#32 Television is not real life.\r\n#38 Look people in the eye when you meet them.\r\n#47 You are not perfect, and you don't have to be.\r\n#50 Enjoy this while you can","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d96a049febdc89b831e781181f93821dda4f4096","amp;dn":"50+Rules+Kids+Won%26rsquo%3Bt+Learn+in+School","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d96a049febdc89b831e781181f93821dda4f4096","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,106,4,159,235,220,137,184,49,231,129,24,31,147,130,29,218,79,64,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
