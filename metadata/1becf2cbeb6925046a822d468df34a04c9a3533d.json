Sublime consisted of three members: Brad Nowell (vocals and guitar), Bud Gaugh (drums), and Eric Wilson (bass guitar). The band achieved major mainstream success with their self-titled third album; however, Nowell died of a heroin overdose shortly before it was released, and the band ceased to exist.
