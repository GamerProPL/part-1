Music by Herbie Hancock and solid acting don't hurt, but the other impressive achievement of Blow-Up, was the outstanding move to color (started with Red Desert tough). Not only had Antonioni been working for a long time in B&amp;W, fact is films or directors who truly master color are extremely rare. Most of the time fine and beautiful use of color is achieved through the use of a limited set of tone. Here is some wonderful use of color, rich in tones, yet devoided of pretention, just beautiful, not invasive (as opposed as to some painting in a movie a la Kubrick, which can be wonderful but adds Kubrick into a movie that's not supposed to have him as a character).\nNo synopsis, no spoiler.\n\nVIDEO :\nPicture quality should be better than the DVD to most eyes (short sample included).\nImportant ! almost every video you can find on the net, including some high bitrate HD releases should be played with ffdshow installed whenever possible. Reason is that by default ffdshow activates the deband filter which is the most universal useful post-processing video filter (deband). Without that you watch something much less nice, and regurlaly awful (especially dark scenes). A simple install of K-Lite Codec Pack will install everything you need in case you've listened to the bad advice often given on the net and you're still using VLC or worse.\nDuration : 1h 52mn\nFormat : AVC\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;125a7b757a525e263c23&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 1.851\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\n\nAUDIO :\nCodec ID : A_AAC\nChannel(s) : 1 channel\nChannel positions : Front: C\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nLanguage : English\n\nAudio #2\nID : 3\nCodec ID : A_AAC\nChannel(s) : 1 channel\nChannel positions : Front: C\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nTitle : Commentary\n\nSUBTITLES:\nBulgarian\nCroatian\nCzech\nDutch\nEnglish\nFinnish\nFrench\nGerman\nGreek\nHungarian\nItalian\nPersian\nPolish\nPortuguese\nRomanian\nSerbian\nSpanish\nTurkish ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47c6e7c65fec6916fc52d134d3adb69e2a097cd9","amp;dn":"Blow+Up-Antonioni-1966-x264_OPTIMIZED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47c6e7c65fec6916fc52d134d3adb69e2a097cd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,198,231,198,95,236,105,22,252,82,209,52,211,173,182,158,42,9,124,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
