Love Songs Collection songs Includes liner notes by Colin Escott.\n Love Songs Collection album If there's ever been a soul singer who deserves to be called on to provide mood music for romantic interludes, it's Al Green.\n With his ringing falsetto, impassioned phrasing, and killer arrangements by famed Hi Records producer Willie Mitchell, Green's LOVE SONGS COLLECTION merits a special place on your shelf.\n All the great songs are here: the simmering &quot;Call Me (Come Back Home),&quot; cool and loose &quot;Here I Am (Come and Take Me),&quot; yearning &quot;Let's Stay Together,&quot; and sassy &quot;Love And Happiness&quot;.\n Although most of these songs were either written or co-written by Green, there's also a number of notable covers including a restrained interpretation of Kris Kristofferson's &quot;For The Good Times&quot; and a version of the Bee Gees' &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot; that aches with hurt.\n Liner Note Author: Colin Escott. Personnel includes: Al Green, Ann Nesby (vocals).\n Compilation producers: Bryan Kelley, Shannon Ward. Rolling Stone (2/6/03, p. 65) - 4 stars out of 5 - &quot;... Green has plenty of greatest-hits collections, but this is as fine a place as any to start... &quot;\n\n===================================================================================\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a5234d660949d89069b5fcd4b620fb93bb3e8cd","amp;dn":"Al+Green+-+The+Love+Songs+Collection+%282013%29+MP3+%40+Compilation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a5234d660949d89069b5fcd4b620fb93bb3e8cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,82,52,214,96,148,157,137,6,155,95,205,75,98,15,185,59,179,232,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
