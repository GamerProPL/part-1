Soon after extracting a bullet from his brother's arm, Alex (Konstantin Lavroneko) relocates his family from the city to his father's old house in the countryside. As the family settles into their rustic existence, Alex's wife Vera (Maria Bonnevie) reveals that she is pregnant by another man. Enraged by his wife's announcement, Alex consults with his brother and demands that Vera terminate the pregnancy. When the forced abortion goes horribly awry and Alex's brother suffers a severe heart attack, a confrontation with the man Alex believes to have seduced his wife send events quickly spiraling out of control.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Izgnanie.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,958,488,064 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:30:40\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 704x296 (AR: 2.378)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1531 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.294 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0488905/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0488905/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRussian audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nMy rip of the Artificial Eye DVD\n\nAndrei Zvyagintsev - Izgnanie [The Banishment] (2007)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:775c5d2c98c777ce3fd26c75fc6479e3393643b3","amp;dn":"Andrei+Zvyagintsev+-+Izgnanie+%5BThe+Banishment%5D+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"775c5d2c98c777ce3fd26c75fc6479e3393643b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,92,93,44,152,199,119,206,63,210,108,117,252,100,121,227,57,54,67,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
