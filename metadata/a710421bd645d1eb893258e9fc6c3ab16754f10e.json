The purpose of this book is to show a range of examples where mathematics can be seen at work in everyday life. \r\n\r\nFrom money (APR, mortgage repayments, personal finance), simple first and second order ODEs, sport and games (tennis, rugby, athletics, darts, tournament design, soccer, snooker), business (stock control, linear programming, check digits, promotion policies, investment), the social sciences (voting methods, Simpsonâ€™s Paradox, drug testing, measurements of inequality) to TV game shows and even gambling (lotteries, roulette, poker, horse racing), the mathematics behind commonplace events is explored. Fully worked examples illustrate the ideas discussed and each chapter ends with a collection of exercises.\r\nEveryday Mathematics supports other first year modules by giving students extra practice in working with calculus, linear algebra, geometry, trigonometry and probability. Secondary/high school level mathematics is all that is required for students to understand the material. Those students whose degree course includes writing an extended mathematical essay will find many suitable topics here, with pointers to extend and develop the material","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a710421bd645d1eb893258e9fc6c3ab16754f10e","amp;dn":"Mathematics+in+Everyday+Life+-+1st+Edition+%282016%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a710421bd645d1eb893258e9fc6c3ab16754f10e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,16,66,27,214,69,209,235,137,50,88,233,252,108,58,177,103,84,241,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
