H. Freeman | December 2014 | ISBN-10: 1464111693 | PDF | 880 pages| 35.1 mb\r\n\r\nStephen Kokoskaâ€™s Introductory Statistics: A Problem-Solving Approach demonstrated that when presented in a precise step-by-step manner, with an understanding of what makes the material difficult, statistics can be made accessible, meaningful, and useful, even to the most skeptical students.\r\nIn this thoroughly updated new edition, Kokoska again combines a traditional, classic approach to teaching statistics with contemporary examples and pedagogical features, blending solid mathematics with lucid, often humorous writing and a distinctive stepped â€œSolution Trailâ€ problem-solving approach to help students understand the processes behind basic statistical arguments, statistical inference, and data-based decision making. The second edition is a fully integrated text/media package with its own dedicated version of LaunchPad, W.H. Freemanâ€™s breakthrough online course space.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author \nhttps://s33.postimg.org/3tmvg1c7j/kokoska.jpg\r\nSteve Kokoska received his undergraduate degree from Boston College, and his M.S and Ph.D. from the University of New Hampshire. He has published a number of research papers in mathematics journals. He has also presented results at national conferences, written several books, and been awarded grants from the National Science Foundation, the Center for Rural Pennsylvania, and the Ben Franklin Program.\r\nSteve is a long-time consultant for the College Board and conducted workshops in Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and China. He has been teaching at Bloomsburg University for 25years and recently served as Director of the Honors Program.\r\nSteve has been teaching introductory statistics classes throughout his academic career, and there is no doubt that this is his favorite course. This class (and text) provides students with basic, life-long, quantitative skills that they will use in almost any job and teaches them how to think and reason logically. Steve believes very strongly in data-driven decisions and conceptual understanding through problem solving.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nChapter 0 Why Study Statistics 1\r\nChapter 1 An Introduction to Statistics and Statistical Inference 9\r\nChapter 2 Tables and Graphs for Summarizing Data 27\r\nChapter 3 Numerical Summary Measures 73\r\nChapter 4 Probability 123\r\nChapter 5 Random Variables and Discrete Probability Distributions 187\r\nChapter 6 Continuous Probability Distributions 243\r\nChapter 7 Sampling Distributions 295\r\nChapter 8 Confidence Intervals Based on a Single Sample 333\r\nChapter 9 Hypothesis Tests Based on a Single Sample 391\r\nChapter 10 C onfidence Intervals and Hypothesis Tests Based on Two Samples or Treatments 461\r\nChapter 11 The Analysis of Variance 531\r\nChapter 12 Correlation and Linear Regression 573\r\nChapter 13 Categorical Data and Frequency Tables 651\r\nChapter 14 Nonparametric Statistics 681\r\n \nhttps://s33.postimg.org/6s631c6un/Introductory_Statistics_A_Problem_Solving_Appr.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e835115c96835446cee30be58cba94bf0649796c","amp;dn":"Introductory+Statistics+-+A+Problem+Solving+Approach+%282nd+Ed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e835115c96835446cee30be58cba94bf0649796c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,53,17,92,150,131,84,70,206,227,11,229,140,186,148,191,6,73,121,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
