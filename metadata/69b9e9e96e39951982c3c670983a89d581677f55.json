The band has gone through several phases; its strongest commercial success occurred between 1978 and 1987, after which it temporarily disbanded. During that period, the band released a series of hit songs, including 1981's &quot;Don't Stop Believin'&quot;, which became in 2009 the top-selling catalog track in iTunes history. Its parent studio album, Escape, the band's eighth and most successful, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and yielded another of their most popular singles, &quot;Open Arms&quot;. Its 1983 follow-up, Frontiers, was almost as successful in the United States, reaching No. 2 and spawning several successful singles; it broadened the band's appeal in the United Kingdom, where it reached No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart. Journey enjoyed a successful reunion in the mid-1990s, and later regrouped with a series of lead singers.\n\nSales have resulted in two gold albums, eight multi-platinum albums, and one diamond album (including seven consecutive multi-platinum albums between 1978 and 1987). They have had eighteen Top 40 singles in the US, six of which reached the Top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and two of which reached No. 1 on other Billboard charts, and a No. 6 hit on the UK Singles Chart in &quot;Don't Stop Believin'&quot;. Originally a progressive rock band, Journey was described by Allmusic as having cemented a reputation as &quot;one of America's most beloved (and sometimes hated) commercial rock/pop bands&quot; by 1978, when they redefined their sound by embracing traditional pop arrangements on their fourth album, Infinity. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Journey has sold 47 million albums in the US, making them the 28th best selling band. Their worldwide sales have reached over 80 million albums. A 2005 USA Today opinion poll named Journey the fifth best American rock band in history.[8][9] Their songs have become arena rock staples and are still played on rock radio stations across the world.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGreatest Hits is a compilation album by the American rock band Journey, released on November 15, 1988 by Columbia Records. It is the band's best-selling album to date, spending over 760 weeks on the Billboard pop album charts (more than any other compilation album in history) and selling over 25 million copies as of 2008. As of December 2008, it is the sixth highest certified greatest hits package in the United States according to the RIAA, behind only similar packages by The Eagles, Billy Joel, Elton John, and The Beatles' red and blue compilations.\n\nIt continues to be one of the most popular greatest hits packages, selling 500,000 to one million copies per year. The album has been reissued several times and was digitally remastered for compact disc by Legacy Recordings, issued on August 1, 2006, with a bonus track. In Japan, the album has been reissued as Open Arms: Greatest Hits with the song &quot;Open Arms&quot; appearing as the first song on the album. A second Journey compilation album, Greatest Hits 2, was released in November 2011.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69b9e9e96e39951982c3c670983a89d581677f55","amp;dn":"Journey+-+Greatest+Hits+%5B1988%5D%5B2011%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69b9e9e96e39951982c3c670983a89d581677f55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,185,233,233,110,57,149,25,130,195,198,112,152,58,137,213,129,103,127,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
