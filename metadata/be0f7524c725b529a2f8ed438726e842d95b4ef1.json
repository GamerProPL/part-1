It was a landmark LP for the so-called &amp;quot;black rock&amp;quot; movement, best-typified in the statement of purpose &amp;quot;Who Says a Funk Band Can't Play Rock?!&amp;quot;; more than that, though, the whole album is full of fuzzed-out, Hendrix-style guitar licks, even when the music is clearly meant for the dancefloor. This may not have been a new concept for Funkadelic, but it's executed here with the greatest clarity and accessibility in their catalog. Furthermore, out of George Clinton's many conceptual albums (serious and otherwise), One Nation Under a Groove is the pinnacle of his political consciousness. It's unified by a refusal to acknowledge boundaries Ã¢â‚¬â€ social, sexual, or musical Ã¢â‚¬â€ and, by extension, the uptight society that created them. The tone is positive, not militant Ã¢â‚¬â€ this funk is about community, freedom, and independence, and you can hear it in every cut (even the bizarre, outrageously scatological &amp;quot;P.E. Squad&amp;quot;). The title cut is one of funk's greatest anthems, and &amp;quot;Groovallegiance&amp;quot; and the terrific &amp;quot;Cholly&amp;quot; both dovetail nicely with its concerns. The aforementioned &amp;quot;Who Says a Funk Band Can't Play Rock?!&amp;quot; is a seamless hybrid that perfectly encapsulates the band's musical agenda, while &amp;quot;Into You&amp;quot; is one of their few truly successful slow numbers. The original LP included a three-song bonus EP featuring the heavy riff rock of &amp;quot;Lunchmeataphobia,&amp;quot; an unnecessary instrumental version of &amp;quot;P.E. Squad,&amp;quot; and a live &amp;quot;Maggot Brain&amp;quot;; these tracks were appended to the CD reissue. In any form, One Nation Under a Groove is the best realization of Funkadelic's ambitions, and one of the best funk albums ever released. \n\n- Steve Huey\n\n\nSongs/Tracks \n\n01 One Nation Under A Groove - 7:28 \n02 Groovallegiance - 7:00 \n03 Who Says A Funk Band Can't Play Rock?! - 6:18 \n04 Promentalshitbackwashpsychosis Enema Squad (The DooDoo Chasers) - 10:45 \n05 Into You - 5:41 \n06 Cholly (Funk Getting Ready To Roll!) - 4:27 \n07 Lunchmeataphobia (Think!
