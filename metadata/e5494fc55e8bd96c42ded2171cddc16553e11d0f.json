For Steve Earle, this third so-so effort from the then-rouÃƒÅ½Ã‹Å“-ish troubadour was a pretty glaring rehab-ahead warning light. The sloppiness was beginning to show: half the disc bogs down in throwaways, cheap echoes of Guitar Town and Exit 0's country-rock acumen. The rest, fortunately, is prime, focused Earle: the Vietnam-vet title track, the Wild West-themed &quot;Snake Oil,&quot; and the oft-covered classic &quot;The Devil's Right Hand,&quot; in which the composer achieves that perfect\nbalance of city-slick pop and hillbilly twang. Earle would hit that one-two combo again, but not until he shook that party monkey a few albums later. --Tom Lanham\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Copperhead road                                      [04:30]\n02.Snake oil                                            [03:31]\n03.Back to the wall                                     [05:29]\n04.The devil's right hand                               [03:03]\n05.Johnny come lately                                   [04:10]\n06.Even when i'm blue                                   [04:14]\n07.You belong to me                                     [04:25]\n08.Waiting on you                                       [05:10]\n09.Once you love                                        [04:40]\n10.Nothing but A child                                  [04:23]\n____\n\n43:35 min\n 61,6 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5494fc55e8bd96c42ded2171cddc16553e11d0f","amp;dn":"Steve_Earle-Copperhead_Road-%28Retail%29-1998-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5494fc55e8bd96c42ded2171cddc16553e11d0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,73,79,197,94,139,217,108,66,222,210,23,28,221,193,101,83,225,29,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
