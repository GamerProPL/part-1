Deluxe hinged box with two individual paper cases holding CDs. The inner sleevs are reproductions of \r\nthe typical yellow BBC Transcription Series vinyl sleeves. Some very few box-sets were sold with TMOQ-style sleeves \r\nbecause not enough yellow BBC sleeves were made. This title has been released with two different covers. The &quot;Maxell \r\nis Pleased to Present&quot; version has black artwork from a famous promo only radio LP, while the &quot;Floating Pig Blimp&quot; \r\nversion has famous William Stout white artwork which has been used on many of previous LP and CD release. Also reissued\r\nas a standard jewel case with the same catalogue #. What we in the collectors' circle were mostly frustrated with the \r\nofficial &quot;BBC Sessions&quot; release in 1997 was its incompleteness. To our joy, however, Empress Valley has released a 4 CD \r\nset covering chronologically all of the BBC radio sessions that the band had in its history. The title says, the materials \r\nincluded in it are very complete, covering every tune played and every interview or chat, if any, recorded at the respective\r\nsessions. In addition, the quality of the audios allegedly made from Pre-FM Master Reels is also of excellent quality, \r\nalmost equal to that of the versions in the official release, except for the band's session for &quot;Rhythm And Blues&quot; recorded \r\non 16 March '69 which is said to be rather made from an Aircheck Master. Even the audio of the &quot;Rhythm And Blues&quot; session as \r\nfeatured in the new title is a slight upgrade over that of the past title &quot;Sunshine Woman&quot; on Flagge label. As especially \r\nnoticeable from the deeper echoes of Robert's voice in many songs of April 1, 1971 concert, the audio mix in the title is \r\nclearly different from the versions in the official release, which serves as an evidence that the title was not made by \r\nsimply copying the official versions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5de533f1bfc99e510462c81a29fb300edf670494","amp;dn":"led+zeppelin+1969-1971+the+complete+bbc+radio+sessions+flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5de533f1bfc99e510462c81a29fb300edf670494","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,229,51,241,191,201,158,81,4,98,200,26,41,251,48,14,223,103,4,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
