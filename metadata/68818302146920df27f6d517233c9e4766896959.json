Marisa Berenson plays Lady Lyndon, whom Barry has managed to seduce; and when her elderly husband dies, she marries Barry thus elevating his social and economic station in life. But Barry is rather clumsy at playing at peerage, and bit by bit manages to squander most of the Lyndon fortune until his stepson, Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali) grows old enough to do something about it.\n\n  Starring: Ryan O'Neal, Marisa Berenson, Patrick Magee, Hardy Kruger, Steven Berkoff.\n\n  Directed by: Stanley Kubrick.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 2hr. 57min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 688 x 432","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68818302146920df27f6d517233c9e4766896959","amp;dn":"Barry+Lyndon+%281975%29+%28Ryan+O%5C%27Neal%2C+Marisa+Berenson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68818302146920df27f6d517233c9e4766896959","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,129,131,2,20,105,32,223,39,246,213,23,35,60,158,71,102,137,105,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
