The game tells about the son of media mogul Cliff Kahlo, who went into quarantine (last paradise) island called Bana with the aim of shooting a documentary about the life of a zombie. Cliff - the spoiled son of a powerful media mogul, who stole a boat with his father's friends, for the filming of the documentary: Revealing the truth to the public about the outbreak of the zombie virus on the island of Bana. Their plan: to get into a top-secret quarantine island of the archipelago Narapela and shoot everything that happens there. Players as in previous installments of the series will be free to explore this large island, but this time we must act covertly as possible, to avoid encounters with the bloodthirsty zombies who can hear your every whisper and feel your scent. Escape Dead Island is different from other parts of the visual style, but it will also have to fight in melee with the zombies in the setting of a tropical island. You will have a set of new weapons.\n\n\n\nFeatures repack:\n- Do not cut | Do not recoded\n- Game Version 1.0.0\n- Installation time ~ 10 minutes\n- Repack by xatab","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56e3512dc426a2086bc0f6395b994e6b0edbbd98","amp;dn":"Escape+Dead+Island+%282014%29+PC+%7C+RePack+by+xatab","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56e3512dc426a2086bc0f6395b994e6b0edbbd98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,227,81,45,196,38,162,8,107,192,246,57,91,153,78,107,14,219,189,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
