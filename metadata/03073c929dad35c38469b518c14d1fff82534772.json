The non-linear story-line intertwines striking images depicting the devastation and human suffering resulting from the bomb with the passionate affair and past memories of the two lovers. This movie deals with historical and personal memory and how war affects the psyches of human beings. It is one of the most poetic and touching films ever made.\n\n\nDo you like really fucked-up, weird flicks? Cool! Do &quot;symbolic metaphors&quot; give you a \ntingle?
