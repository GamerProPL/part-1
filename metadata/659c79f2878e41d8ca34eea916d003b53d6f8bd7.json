As Negroni dissects what happened and why, she explores their common themes and, most important, what has been learned from them to make planes safer. Indeed, as Negroni shows, virtually every aspect of modern pilot training, airline operation, and airplane design has been shaped by lessons learned from disaster. Along the way, she also details some miraculous saves, when quick-thinking pilots averted catastrophe and kept hundreds of people alive.\r\n\r\nTying in aviation science, performance psychology, and extensive interviews with pilots, engineers, human factors specialists, crash survivors, and others involved in accidents all over the world, The Crash Detectives is an alternately terrifying and inspiring book that might just cure your fear of flying, and will definitely make you a more informed passenger","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:659c79f2878e41d8ca34eea916d003b53d6f8bd7","amp;dn":"The+Crash+Detectives+Most+Mysterious+Air+Disasters+%282016%29+%5BWWRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"659c79f2878e41d8ca34eea916d003b53d6f8bd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,156,121,242,135,142,65,216,202,52,238,169,22,208,3,181,61,111,139,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
