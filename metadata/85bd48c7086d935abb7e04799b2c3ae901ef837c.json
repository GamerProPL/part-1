Perhaps because of its age -- two of the trio were still in their teens when they recorded their debut single -- the band also brings in elements of decidedly unhip groups like Elton John, as well as classic rockers like David Bowie, the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones. With an exuberant, youthful enthusiasm, Supergrass tied all of their influences together in new surprising ways, where a Buzzcocks riff could slam into three-part harmonies out of &quot;Crocodile Rock,&quot; or have a galloping music hall rhythm stutter like the best moments of the Who.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Caught By The Fuzz\n02.Pumping On Your Stereo\n03.Alright\n04.Moving\n05.Richard III\n06.Grace\n07.Late In The Day\n08.Seen The Light\n09.Mansize Rooster\n10.Sun Hits The Sky\n11.Kiss Of Life\n12.Mary\n13.Going Out\n14.Lenny\n15.Bullet\n16.It's Not Me\n17.Rush Hour Soul\n18.Strange Ones\n19.Lose It\n20.Time\n21.Wait For The Sun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85bd48c7086d935abb7e04799b2c3ae901ef837c","amp;dn":"Supergrass+-+Supergrass+Is+10+Best+Of++94-2004+%282004%29+MP3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85bd48c7086d935abb7e04799b2c3ae901ef837c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,189,72,199,8,109,147,90,187,126,4,121,155,44,58,233,1,239,131,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
