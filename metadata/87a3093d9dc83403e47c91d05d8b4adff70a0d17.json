Throughout its existence, Rammstein's six-man lineup has been unchangedâ€”singer Till Lindemann, guitarists Richard Z. Kruspe and Paul H. Landers, bassist Oliver &quot;Ollie&quot; Riedel, drummer Christoph &quot;Doom&quot; Schneider and keyboardist Christian &quot;Flake&quot; Lorenz.\r\n\r\nThe majority of their songs are in German, but they have also performed songs entirely or partially in other languages including English, Spanish, French, and Russian. Rammstein's award-winning live shows are known for their pyrotechnic elements and both on and off-stage theatrics.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbums included:\r\n1995 - Herzeleid\r\n1997 - Sehnsucht\r\n2001 - Mutter\r\n2004 - Reise, Reise\r\n2005 - Rosenrot\r\n2009 - Liebe ist fÃ¼r alle da\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVogard7A forms discographies under the following standards:\r\n1. All studio songs must be present at 320kbps.\r\n2. Demos are not required, but if included they will be included as duplicates.\r\n3. Live albums are not required, but will be included if not difficult to find.\r\n4. If acoustic or instrumental versions are rare, then it is not necessary to include them.\r\n5. If some songs were never released in an LP or EP, i.e. from a soundtrack, then a &quot;Rare and Misc&quot; folder will include the overflow. Number is based on date they were created. If some songs were only ever included in Singles, they may or may not get a Single album, based on judgement.\r\n6. The goal is to be able to open a folder from your music player and have all of the songs available without duplicates. Because of this I will not include an identical song twice, with priority given to older album &gt; newer album &gt; EP &gt; Single.\r\n7. Metadata for all songs are edited by hand gathering information from sources like Wikipedia or Discogs.\r\n8. All Discographies are to be updated once a year in case of new albums, with the latest year in the title of the torrent.\r\n9. NEVER mention the name Vogard7A in any metadata or comments. I share music, I don't need to stamp my name on other peoples' great work.\r\n10. Include a playlist with my favorite songs from each band! You can delete this if it gets in the way.\r\n\r\nIf there are any errors (not subjective opinions about organization) drop a comment and I'll look at it before updating the Discography next year!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87a3093d9dc83403e47c91d05d8b4adff70a0d17","amp;dn":"Rammstein+Discography+%282016%29+%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87a3093d9dc83403e47c91d05d8b4adff70a0d17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,163,9,61,157,200,52,3,228,124,145,208,93,139,74,223,247,10,13,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
