Zikopoulos, Bruce Brown\nFormat: PDF\nYear: 2014\n\nDescription:In our own Hadoop learning activities, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re constantly struck by how little beginner-level content is available. For almost any topic, we see two things:\nhigh-level marketing blurbs with pretty pictures; and dense, low-level, narrowly\nfocused descriptions. What are missing are solid entry-level explanations\nthat add substance to the marketing fluff and help someone with little or no\nbackground knowledge bridge the gap to the more advanced material. Every\nchapter in this book was written with this goal in mind: to clearly explain the\nchapterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s concept, explain why itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s significant in the Hadoop universe, and\nshow how you can get started with it.\n\nNo matter how much (or how little) you know about Hadoop, getting started\nwith the technology is not exactly easy for a number of reasons. In addition\nto the lack of entry-level content, the rapid pace of change in the Hadoop ecosystem\nmakes it difficult to keep on top of standards. We find that most discussions\non Hadoop either cover the older interfaces, and are never updated;\nor they cover the newer interfaces with little insight into how to bridge the\ngap from the old technology. In this book, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve taken care to describe the\ncurrent interfaces, but we also discuss previous standards, which are still\ncommonly used in environments where some of the older interfaces are\nentrenched.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:321ee580388505b5bfbfa4ef06aa67aac9b0336e","amp;dn":"Hadoop+For+Dummies+%282014%29+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"321ee580388505b5bfbfa4ef06aa67aac9b0336e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,30,229,128,56,133,5,181,191,191,164,239,6,170,103,170,201,176,51,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
