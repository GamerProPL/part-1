In other words, everything you would have learned from your shop and home ec teachers, if youâ€™d had them.\r\n\r\nThe Useful Book features 138 practical projects and how-tos, with step-by-step instructions and illustrations, relevant charts, sidebars, lists, and handy toolboxes. Thereâ€™s a kitchen crash course, including the must-haves for a well-stocked pantry; how to boil an egg (and peel it frustration-free); how to grill, steam, sautÃ©, and roast vegetables. Thereâ€™s Sewing 101, plus how to fold a fitted sheet, tie a tie, mop a floor, make a bed, and set the table for a formal dinner.\r\n\r\nNext up: a 21st-century shop class. The tools that everyone should have, and dozens of cool projects that teach fundamental techniques. Practice measuring, cutting, and nailing by building a birdhouse. Make a bookshelf or a riveted metal picture frame. Plus: do-it-yourself plumbing; car repair basics; and home maintenance, from priming and painting to refinishing wood floors.\r\n\r\nThe Useful Book 2016-DiSTRiBUTiON\r\nJune 14, 2016 | English | 416 pages | PDF | 38.84 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:018e8f241a29a9171c0d7d39c463850b27cb1e2f","amp;dn":"David.Bowers-The.Useful.Book.2016.RETAiL.eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"018e8f241a29a9171c0d7d39c463850b27cb1e2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,142,143,36,26,41,169,23,28,13,125,57,196,99,133,11,39,203,30,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
