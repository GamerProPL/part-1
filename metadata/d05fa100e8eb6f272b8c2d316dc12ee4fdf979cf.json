The eponymous first (black) album was released on October 13, 2008. For the album, he enlisted the help of several friends from different bands such as Quidam, Indukti, and Riverside. In stark contrast to his main outfit, Lunatic Soul contains no electric guitars at all and can be best described as a mix of ambient and progressive elements - Duda himself calls the sound &quot;oriental-alternative.&quot;\n\n\nLunatic Soul At MySpac\n\n\n\n\n\n2014 Walking On A Flashlight Beam\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
