Ripped from CDs, one track per chapter.\n\nWhy I didn't upload Jim Dale's version?\nBecause he reads like a computer, he doesn't put heart into the characters. Yes, he may have created 176 different voices, but his voices are all raspy. He does use them, but he doesn't act, while Stephen Fry, who created less voices, reads ten times better: when a character screams, he will scream too, for example. \nIf you think I'm right, please post a comment. If you think I'm wrong, please post a comment xD . When anyone wants me to upload Jim Dale's version, just ask and I'll do it!\nPlease seed and enjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d295ace45300af3ef889f9001819783a277e8340","amp;dn":"Harry+Potter+1-7+Unabridged+Audiobooks+Narrated+By+Stephen+Fry+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d295ace45300af3ef889f9001819783a277e8340","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,149,172,228,83,0,175,62,248,137,249,0,24,25,120,58,39,126,131,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
