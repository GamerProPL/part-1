Oh wait....this isn't a remaster or crammed or at war. Hit the play button and prepare to be blown away. Go straight to Hotel California and listen to that finger work at the beginning. If that doesn't get your heart racing then you are a music zombie. Read the following review. It sums up this compilation very nicely.\n\n- Big Papi[/i]\n\n[quote]By Bruce Lee\n\n&quot;For the record, we never broke up...&quot; those seven words start out the concert portion of this album and from the music, it's almost believeable. One of the 1970's most famed rock groups, who broke up over disputes and promised not to reunite until Hell Froze Over, have come back together for their reunion concert and it's amazing. It's a stripped down, more intimate show than their first live album, but that's one thing that makes it so amazing. They have nothing but their instruments to make them sound good. And they sound awesome.\n\nThe standouts on the album include &quot;The Last Resort,&quot; which is possibly the best song, &quot;Life In the Fast Lane,&quot; and a chilling version of &quot;Desperado.&quot; But let's not forget the most famous song from the album...a stripped down and amazing version of &quot;Hotel California,&quot; which far surpasses the original.\n\nThe four songs at the beginning, which are new studio recordings(but are shown live on the video version) should be satisfying enough for anyone. They range from hard rocking to original Eagles country-rock.\n\nOverall, this is THE must have CD for any Eagles fan...heck, for ANY MUSIC fan.\n[/quote]\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Eagles - Hell Freezes Over (Geffen 24725)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Eagles\nAlbum................: Hell Freezes Over (Geffen 24725)\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1994 11 08\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 100 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
