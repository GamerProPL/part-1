Thinking the young man is dead, a curious fisherman\nwith a scalpel finds two bullets in his back and a miniature laser device in\nhis hip. The laser reveals a Swiss bank account number. But our wet hero\nisn't dead, and soon finds himself in Zurich. In the bank vault the young\nman discovers his name, Jason Bourne. In addition, he finds a baffling pile\nof different passports, all with his picture, and a huge pile of cash. In\nthe U.S. Embassy, Jason Bourne discovers his love interest and travel\npartner, Marie, along with the fact that someone wants to kill him. Armed\nwith a bag of money and mysterious martial arts skills, with Marie by his\nside, Bourne scours Paris for clues about his identity and past life and\nfinds himself in the middle of two assassination plots masterminded by\nthe CIA.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Matt Damon.\n=&gt;-Franka Potente.\n=&gt;-Chris Cooper.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Doug Liman.\n\nThe Bourne Supremacy.\nTwo years ago, Jason Bourne thought he had walked away from his past. But\nnow the past catches up to Jason Bourne when the CIA threatens to ruin his\nnew life. Bourne and Marie have maintained their anonymous, underground\nexistence at the cost of permanence. Fueled by splintered nightmares and\nhaunted by the past he cannot remember, Bourne moves Marie from city to\ncity, trying to remain one step ahead of the threat implicit in every\nunexplained stranger's glance, every wrong number phone call--that at any\nsecond, without any warning, he might get pulled back into the world he\nhopes he left behind.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Matt Damon.\n=&gt;-Franka Potente.\n=&gt;-Joan Allen.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Paul Greengrass.\n\nThe Bourne Ultimatum.\nBourne is once again brought out of hiding, Jason Bourne is now hunted by\nthe people who made him what he is--legendary assassin. Having lost his\nmemory and the one person he loved, he is undeterred by the barrage of\nbullets and a new generation of highly-trained killers. Bourne has only one\nobjective: to go back to the beginning and find out who he was.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Matt Damon.\n=&gt;-Edgar Ramirez.\n=&gt;-Joan Allen.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Paul Greengrass.\n\nThe Bourne Legacy.\nA reporter of The Guardian that is writing articles about the Operations\nTreadstone and Blackbriar is murdered and the American Senate Committee\ninvestigates the participation of the CIA directors and responsible for the\nprograms. CIA Director Ezra Kramer summons the retired USAF Colonel Eric Byer\nto clean the mess and he discovers a Youtube video with the responsible for\nthe Treadstone and Outcome Operations together in a public event. Eric Byer\ndecides to shutdown the Outcome Operation, a defense program that uses green\nand blue pills to enhance the physical and mental capabilities of the agents\nsince the Senate investigation would certainly discover the connection\nbetween the operations. Byer orders to kill the Outcome agents, including\nAaron Cross that is training in Alaska, using a drone to track a sensor\nimplanted in Aaron's leg, but he puts the device in a wolf that is destroyed.\nByer believes that Cross is dead and he uses Dr. Donald Foite to kill his\ncolleagues in the research center; however Dr. Marta Shearing flees from the\nattempt and survives. When Dr. Shearing is attacked by CIA killers in her\nhouse, Aaron Cross saves her expecting to get the pills. Soon Cross learns\nthat he does not need the green pills anymore, only the blue ones, and he\ntravels with Dr. Shearing to the Philippines, where the blue pills are\nmanufactured. When Byer finds that they are in the Philippines, he sends an\nassassin to hunt them down.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Jeremy Renner.\n=&gt;-Rachel Weisz.\n=&gt;-Edward Norton.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Tony Gilroy.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Action : Thriller : Mystery.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2002 : 2004 : 2007 : 2012.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.11 GiB : 1.01 GiB : 1.08 GiB : 1.26 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 339 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 58mn : 1h 48mn : 1h 55mn : 2h 14mn.\n=&gt;-The Bourne Identity........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258463/\n=&gt;-The Bourne Supremacy.......: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372183/\n=&gt;-The Bourne Ultimatum.......: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0440963/\n=&gt;-The Bourne Legacy..........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194173/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.35:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 544.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 222 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 143 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:115c778d4804d378aafe0947ecfb22cd25191353","amp;dn":"The+Bourne+Film+Series+1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4+-+Action+Mystery+2002-2012+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"115c778d4804d378aafe0947ecfb22cd25191353","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,92,119,141,72,4,211,120,170,254,9,71,236,251,34,205,37,25,19,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
