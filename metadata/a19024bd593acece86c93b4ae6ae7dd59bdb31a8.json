The novel was first published in December 1815. As in her other novels, Austen explores the concerns and difficulties of genteel women living in Georgian-Regency England; she also creates a lively 'comedy of manners' among her characters.\n\nBefore she began the novel, Austen wrote, &quot;I am going to take a heroine whom no-one but myself will much like.&quot; In the very first sentence she introduces the title character as &quot;Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich.&quot; Emma, however, is also rather spoiled; she greatly overestimates her own matchmaking abilities; and she is blind to the dangers of meddling in other people's lives and is often mistaken about the meanings of others' actions.\n\n\n\nThis version of Emma is a four-part BBC television drama serial adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Emma, first published in 1815. The episodes were written by Sandy Welch, acclaimed writer of previous BBC costume-dramas Jane Eyre and North and South.\n\nFilming began in April 2009 in the village of Chilham, Kent just outside of Canterbury. Episode one premiered on Sunday 4 October 2009.\n\n\n\n\nCast\n\n    * Emma Woodhouse ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Romola Garai\n    * Mr Knightley ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Jonny Lee Miller\n    * Mr Woodhouse ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Michael Gambon\n    * Harriet Smith ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Louise Dylan\n    * Miss Taylor / Mrs Weston ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Jodhi May\n    * Mr Weston ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Robert Bathurst\n    * Frank Churchill ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Rupert Evans\n    * Jane Fairfax ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Laura Pyper\n    * Miss Bates ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Tamsin Greig\n    * Mrs Bates ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Valerie Lilley\n    * Mr Elton ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Blake Ritson\n    * Mrs Elton ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Christina Cole\n    * John Knightley ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Dan Fredenburgh\n    * Isabella Knightley ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Poppy Miller\n    * Robert Martin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Jefferson Hall\n    * Mrs Goddard ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Veronica Roberts\n    * Mrs Cole ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Liza Sadovy\n    * Miss Martin 1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Eileen O'Higgins\n    * Miss Martin 2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Sarah Ovens\n    * Mrs Churchill ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Susie Trayling\n    * Mr Dixon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Frank Doody\n    * Miss Campbell / Mrs Dixon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Amy Loughton.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a19024bd593acece86c93b4ae6ae7dd59bdb31a8","amp;dn":"Jane+Austen+-+Emma++%28BBC+2009+-+Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a19024bd593acece86c93b4ae6ae7dd59bdb31a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,144,36,189,89,58,206,206,134,201,59,74,230,174,125,213,155,219,49,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
