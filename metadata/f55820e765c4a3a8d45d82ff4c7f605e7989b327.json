The band currently consists of Mike Ness (vocals, guitars), Jonny Wickersham (guitars), Brent Harding (bass) and Charlie Quintana (drums). They are often credited as one of the leading bands of the 1980s hardcore punk explosion.\n\nThe group briefly disbanded in 1985, due to frontman Ness' drug addiction, but reformed around 1986 and have continued being active today, even after the death of longtime guitarist Dennis Danell, who succumbed to a brain aneurysm in 2000. Since their inception the band lineup has been a virtual revolving-door of talent, with many members coming and going, Ness has been the only constant member. The band's classic line-up is Ness on guitar and vocals, Danell on guitar, John Maurer on bass and Chris Reece on drums.\n\nAmong mainstream audiences, Social Distortion are best known for their hit singles &quot;Ball and Chain&quot;, &quot;Story of My Life&quot;, &quot;I Was Wrong&quot; and &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot; as well as a cover of Johnny Cash's &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;.\n\n=================================================================\nArtist    -  Social D        \nAlbum     -  various                                          \nGenre     -  punk                                             \nLabel     -  13th Floor, Posh Boy, Restless, Epic, Time Bomb\nYear      -  1978-1985, 1986-present                                            \nTracks    -  n/a                                               \nPlaytime  -  n/a\nFile Type -  .mp3\nSize      -  673.03 MB\nkbps      -  VBR/256 AVG\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy.
