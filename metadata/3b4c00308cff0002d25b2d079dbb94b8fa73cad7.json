Jancos is a wide-eyed innocent who works as an occasional postal worker and as a caretaker for Mr. Ezster. An outsider and a visionary, he marvels at the miracles of creation, from the planets rotating in the heavens to the sundry animals on earth. One day, a circus featuring jars full of medical anomalies and a massive dead whale entombed in a corrugated metal trailer visits Jancos&amp;#039; economically depressed village. Another more sinister attraction is a shadowy figure dubbed &quot;The Prince,&quot; whose nihilist rants incite the town&amp;#039;s disaffected to riot. Not long afterwards, Mrs. Ezster cajoles her estranged husband to join a citizen&amp;#039;s action group against the circus, threatening to move back into his house if he doesn&amp;#039;t play along. Tension in the town builds until, after one of The Prince&amp;#039;s hate-filled speeches, throngs of angry men with blunt instruments ransack and brutalize a men&amp;#039;s hospital ward. When the dust clears, lives are irrevocably changed. This film was screened at the 2000 Toronto Film Festival.\n\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n&amp;#039;If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE&amp;#039;\n\n... simply search for &amp;#039;freakyflicks&amp;#039; \n*************************************** \n************** FREAKYFLICKS ************* \n***************************************\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b4c00308cff0002d25b2d079dbb94b8fa73cad7","amp;dn":"B%C3%A9la+Tarr+-+Werckmeister+harm%C3%B3ni%C3%A1k+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b4c00308cff0002d25b2d079dbb94b8fa73cad7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,76,0,48,140,255,0,2,210,91,45,7,157,187,148,184,250,115,202,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
