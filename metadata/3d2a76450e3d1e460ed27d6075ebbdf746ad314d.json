By not containing any selections recorded with the band&amp;#039;s original &amp;#039;60s lineup with vocalist Rod Evans (&quot;Hush,&quot; &quot;Kentucky Woman,&quot; etc.), and focusing only on the Ian Gillan and David Coverdale eras, Purple&amp;#039;s heaviest compositions are spotlighted.\n\nThroughout DEEPEST PURPLE, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore shows why many six-string enthusiasts consider him to be one of the kings of classic riffs, especially with his work on Purple&amp;#039;s two biggest hits, &quot;Smoke on the Water,&quot; and &quot;Black Night.&quot; Although the ferocious &quot;Speed King&quot; was from the early &amp;#039;70s, it easily holds its own against &amp;#039;80s/&amp;#039;90s thrash and speed metal. The extended compositions &quot;Strange Kind of Woman,&quot; &quot;Highway Star,&quot; &quot;Child in Time,&quot; and &quot;Woman from Tokyo&quot; include improvised sections. Also featured are the more succinct &quot;Burn,&quot; &quot;Stormbringer,&quot; and &quot;Fireball,&quot; plus the heavy metal road anthem &quot;Space Truckin&amp;#039;.&quot; At over an hour in length, DEEPEST PURPLE: THE VERY BEST OF DEEP PURPLE is the best single disc collection of Deep Purple hits you can find.\n\n\nDeepest Purple CD\nDeep Purple \n\nCategory Rock, Rock/Pop, Hard Rock \nLabel Deep Purple \nOrig Year 1980 \nDiscs 1 \nStreet Date Oct 25, 1990 \nStudio/Live Mixed \nMono/Stereo Stereo \n\nTrack Listing\n \n  1.
