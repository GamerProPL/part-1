The film is directed by Ridley Scott and stars Christian Bale, Aaron Paul, Joel Edgerton, Sigourney Weaver and John Turturro, Ben Kingsley, Indira Varma, Ben Mendelsohn and Maria Valverde. The movie is based on the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt as led by Moses and related in the Old Testament Book of Exodus. Steve Zaillian (SchindlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s List, Moneyball, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) has written the screenplay based on a screen story by Bill Collage &amp; Adam Cooper (Accepted). Scott is also producing the project with Peter Chernin (Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Oblivion, The Heat), Jenno Topping, Michael Schaefer and Mark Huffam. Scott has previously collaborated with such composers as Hans Zimmer (Gladiator, Black Hawk Down), Vangelis (The Blade Runner), Jerry Goldsmith (Alien), Marc Streitenfeld (Robin Hood, Prometheus), Harry Gregson-Williams (Kingdom of Heaven) and most recently, Daniel Pemberton (The Counselor). Exodus: Gods and Kings is set to be released on December 12, 2014 by 20th Century Fox.\n\nThe Spanish composer who has received three Academy Award nominations for his music for The Constant Gardener, The Kite Runner and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy also has the Spanish drama Ma ma coming up. The film is written and directed by Julio Medem and stars Penelope Cruz, Luis Tosar and Asier Exteandia. Alvaro Longoria (Che, The Monk) is executive producing the project.
