Utilizing minimal math, the contents are presented in a clear, objective manner, emphasizing and encouraging experimentation.\n\nThe book has been organized into two parts. Part I: Image Processing begins with an overview of the field, then introduces the fundamental concepts, notation, and terminology associated with image representation and basic image processing operations. Next, it discusses MATLABÃ‚Â® and its Image Processing Toolbox with the start of a series of chapters with hands-on activities and step-by-step tutorials. These chapters cover image acquisition and digitization; arithmetic, logic, and geometric operations; point-based, histogram-based, and neighborhood-based image enhancement techniques; the Fourier Transform and relevant frequency-domain image filtering techniques; image restoration; mathematical morphology; edge detection techniques; image segmentation; image compression and coding; and feature extraction and representation.\n\nPart II: Video Processing presents the main concepts and terminology associated with analog video signals and systems, as well as digital video formats and standards. It then describes the technically involved problem of standards conversion, discusses motion estimation and compensation techniques, shows how video sequences can be filtered, and concludes with an example of a solution to object detection and tracking in video sequences using MATLABÃ‚Â®.\n\nExtra features of this book include:\n\n    More than 30 MATLABÃ‚Â® tutorials, which consist of step-by-step guides to exploring image and video processing techniques using MATLABÃ‚Â®\n\n    Chapters supported by figures, examples, illustrative problems, and exercises\n\n    Useful websites and an extensive list of bibliographical references\n\nThis accessible text is ideal for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students in digital image and video processing courses, as well as for engineers, researchers, software developers, practitioners, and anyone who wishes to learn about these increasingly popular topics on their own.\n\n\n\nPublisher: Wiley-IEEE Press; 1 edition (September 21, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0470048158\nISBN-13: 978-0470048153","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24eb58b6905f3a9313d2b0e08f49bf4c9a38783e","amp;dn":"Practical+Image+and+Video+Processing+Using+MATLAB++%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24eb58b6905f3a9313d2b0e08f49bf4c9a38783e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,235,88,182,144,95,58,147,19,210,176,224,143,73,191,76,154,56,120,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
