He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969, &quot;for his writing, which -- in new forms for the novel and drama -- in the destitution of modern man acquires its elevation.&quot;\n\nStrongly influenced by fellow Irish writer, James Joyce, Beckett is sometimes considered the last of the Modernists, however, as his body of work influenced many subsequent writers, he is also considered one of the fathers of the Postmodernist movement.  Either way, he is unquestionably among the most influential writers of the 20th century and one of the key figures in what Martin Esslin called the &quot;Theatre of the Absurd&quot;.  His work is characterized by a bleak, tragicomic outlook on human nature, often coupled with black comedy and gallows humour.\n\n\nThe following books are a mix of PDF and/or ePUB formats.
