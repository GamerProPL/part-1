Through the exercises, we aim at introducing the appeal and interest of modern physics to high-school students. In particular, the problems for the second-round of competition are like long journey of physics, beginning with fundamental physics of junior-high-school level, and ending with the forefronts of updated physics and technology.\nReadership: High school students and high school teachers, as well as undergraduates.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e10ae4e04144b50ec64d2f7e84fa9bb6af6018a5","amp;dn":"Physics+Olympiad+-+Basic+to+Advanced+Exercises+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e10ae4e04144b50ec64d2f7e84fa9bb6af6018a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,10,228,224,65,68,181,14,198,77,47,126,132,250,155,182,175,96,24,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
