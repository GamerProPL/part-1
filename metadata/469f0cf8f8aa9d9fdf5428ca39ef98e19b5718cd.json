As the ultimate experiment in manufactured image, the Gorillaz are a virtual cartoon-character-based hip-hop band who bring together witty, silly lyrics and talented musicians. Infectious old-school hip-hop rhythms, rhymes, and effects courtesy of Deltron 3030's Kid Koala and Del Tha Funkee Homosapien (Russel) are combined with Albarn's passion for chugging lo-fi and edgy melodies to create a seemingly raw but ultimately slick blend of styles. This is nowhere more evident than on the hit single &amp;quot;Clint Eastwood,&amp;quot; which is carried along by the sound of 2-D's slurred voice and a bluesy harmonica melody interrupted by Russel's punching rhymes. But the surprises don't stop there: Ibrahim Ferrer's appearance on &amp;quot;Latin Simone&amp;quot; could have come straight from Buena Vista Social Club but for the obvious Blur-influenced piano style, while the spooky intro to &amp;quot;M1 A1&amp;quot; wouldn't sound out of place on Michael Jackson's Thriller. Backed by Jamie Hewlett's death-wish character on bass, Cibo Matto's Miho Hatori (Noodle) on guitar and occasional hyperactive vocals, and produced by Dan &amp;quot;the Automator&amp;quot; Nakamura, it's hardly surprising that Gorillaz is marked both by a sense of playfulness and a passion for experimentation.\n\nSize: 118MB\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 256k\nCovers: Front and back\nTracker: prq.to/announce","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:469f0cf8f8aa9d9fdf5428ca39ef98e19b5718cd","amp;dn":"Gorillaz+-+Gorillaz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"469f0cf8f8aa9d9fdf5428ca39ef98e19b5718cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,159,12,248,248,170,157,159,223,84,40,202,57,239,152,225,155,87,24,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
