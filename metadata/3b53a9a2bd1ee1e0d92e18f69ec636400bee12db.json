After a failed business deal he owes money to the much more successful gangster Dadan. Dadan has a sister, Afrodita, that he desperately wants to see get married so they strike a deal: Zare is to marry her. But none of the two care much for an arranged marriage: Zare is in love with Ida, Afrodita is waiting for the man of her dreams.\n\nSubtitles (muxed):\n\n- English\n- Dutch\n- Serbian\n- Romanian\n- Bulgarian","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b53a9a2bd1ee1e0d92e18f69ec636400bee12db","amp;dn":"Crna+macka%2C+beli+macor+%28Black+Cat%2C+White+Cat%29+%281998%29+MKV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b53a9a2bd1ee1e0d92e18f69ec636400bee12db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,83,169,162,189,30,225,224,217,46,24,246,158,198,54,64,11,238,18,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
