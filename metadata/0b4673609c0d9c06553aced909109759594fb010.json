Arkansas-born and Alabama-raised Jimi Westbrook, a friend of Fairchild's husband, joined them to make a trio, and the group was completed by the addition of Arkansan Phil Sweet in 1998. From the outset, Little Big Town devoted their sound to harmony and multiple lead vocals, a combination that made the band a hard sell at first. They finally landed a deal at Mercury Records, but it fell through due to disagreements about musical direction. In the wake of the success of the Dixie Chicks, however, Little Big Town suddenly seemed a more likely commercial proposition, and they were taken up by the Dixie Chicks' label, Monument Records, in 2000. \n\n\nGenre................: Country\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Capitol Nashville\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, auCDtect, Log, Cue\n\n\n\n01.Quit Breaking Up With Me\n02.Day Drinking\n03.Tumble And Fall\n04.Pain Killer\n05.Girl Crush\n06.Faster Gun\n07.Good People\n08.Stay All Night\n09.Save Your Sin\n10.Live Forever\n11.Things You Don't Think About\n12.Turn The Lights On\n13.Silver And Gold\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b4673609c0d9c06553aced909109759594fb010","amp;dn":"Little+Big+Town+-+Pain+Killer+%282014%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b4673609c0d9c06553aced909109759594fb010","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,70,115,96,156,13,156,6,85,58,206,217,9,16,151,89,89,79,176,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
