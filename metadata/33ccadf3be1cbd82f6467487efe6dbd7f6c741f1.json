He created some of the world's most memorable fictional characters and is generally regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian period. During his life, his works enjoyed unprecedented fame, and by the twentieth century his literary genius was broadly acknowledged by critics and scholars. His novels and short stories continue to be widely popular.\n\nBorn in Portsmouth, England, Dickens left school to work in a factory after his father was thrown into debtors' prison. Although he had little formal education, his early impoverishment drove him to succeed. Over his career he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, 5 novellas and hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms.\n\nDickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age. His creative genius has been praised by fellow writersÃ¢â‚¬â€from Leo Tolstoy to G. K. Chesterton and George OrwellÃ¢â‚¬â€for its realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and social criticism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33ccadf3be1cbd82f6467487efe6dbd7f6c741f1","amp;dn":"Charles+Dickens+E-Book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33ccadf3be1cbd82f6467487efe6dbd7f6c741f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,204,173,243,190,28,189,130,246,70,116,135,239,230,219,215,246,199,65,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
