Vividly bringing to life the latest scientific research in psychology, cognitive neuroscience, philosophy, and behavioral economics, Gilbert reveals what scientists have discovered about the uniquely human ability to imagine the future, and about our capacity to predict how much we will like it when we get there. With penetrating insight and sparkling prose, Gilbert explains why we seem to know so little about the hearts and minds of the people we are about to become.\nGenre: Non-Fiction, Psychology \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d753cdf4ece3ae3d9f8572daac16085aecb364f","amp;dn":"Stumbling+on+Happines+by+Daniel+Gilbert.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d753cdf4ece3ae3d9f8572daac16085aecb364f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,117,60,223,78,206,58,227,217,248,87,45,170,193,96,133,174,203,54,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
