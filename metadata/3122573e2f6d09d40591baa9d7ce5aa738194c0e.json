An extensive library of symbols is included, and you can create your own using the wizard.\r\n\r\nSimultaneous 2D and 3D Design\r\nAs you design your landscape, the 2D and 3D views are updated automatically. Freely switch between views as needed. Design houses, decks, and other objects in 2D, and then switch to 3D to set their elevation. Most tools can be used in either view.\r\n\r\nThe 2D view, called the Plan view, is used for creating artistic, stylized, CAD-like, or realistic top-down landscape plans. If an object is added to the Plan view it will appear in both the Plan and 3D views, but can be customized for each view if needed. This functionality allows landscape designers to create both detailed 2D plans and realistic 3D designs at the same time.\r\n\r\nChoose your Design Appearance\r\nMany different design types of plan designs are available in Realtime Landscaping Architect through large libraries of symbols, color washes, hatch patterns, gradients, and more. Create rich vibrant designs, or opt for a traditional black and white CAD appearance. Through the use of color washes, even hand-drawn or painted designs are possible.\r\n\r\nHigh Quality Plants\r\nDesign landscapes using a library of over 7,200 high resolution plants including shrubs, annuals, perennials, cacti, water garden and tropical. Plants are included from all climate zones, so you can choose the ones best suited to your clientâ€™s location. Most plants are high-resolution, professionally masked pictures of real plants, so they look realistic even close up. The library also includes 470 high-resolution 3D plant models which are ideal for movies and 3D walkthroughs, and nearly 500 additional standard-resolution 3D plant models.\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements:\r\n- Microsoft Windows (Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, or 10) with the latest Microsoft service packs\r\n- 1 GHz CPU (2 GHz or more recommended)\r\n- 4 GB System Memory (8 GB or more recommended)\r\n- 30 GB available hard disk space\r\n- DirectX 11-compatible Video Card with 512 MB Video Memory (1 GB or more recommended)\r\n- Keyboard\r\n- Mouse or other pointing device\r\n\r\nWhat's New in Realtime Landscaping Architect 2016 \nhttps://www.ideaspectrum.com/new-landscape-design-software/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3122573e2f6d09d40591baa9d7ce5aa738194c0e","amp;dn":"Realtime+Landscaping+Architect+2016+16.07+Incl+Patch+%5BSadeemPC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3122573e2f6d09d40591baa9d7ce5aa738194c0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,34,87,62,47,109,9,212,5,145,186,169,215,206,90,167,56,25,76,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
