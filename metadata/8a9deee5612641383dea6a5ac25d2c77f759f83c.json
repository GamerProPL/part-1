Master designer, Marwan Aridi, has taken the time to perfect the recreation of this ancient art form in digital format with precise attention to detail. This is why Aridi has become known around the world as the finest producer of historically accurate digital art. The reason for this recognition quickly becomes evident once you place an image in your drawing program.\n\nSince all the images are supplied in EPS vector format, any modification or color changes cam be easily done using a compatible illustration or graphics application. \n\nAridi apparently did some combining of various volumes after all 37 volumes were complete. Volume 34 was originally called Seamless Dreams (seamless web background images), but was later discontinued and added to volume 18 BACKGROUNDS II. Volume 18 BACKGROUNDS was discontinued and also combined with volume 18 BACKGROUNDS II (notice there is no BACKGROUNDS I, only II and III).\n\nIncluded are all 38 original volumes compressed into one 7-ZIP file and will expand to 38 subdirectories with 19,654 files and 2.7Gb in size.\n\nGo to aridi.com for thumbnails of all images.\n\n\nARIDI Vol.01 - Initial Caps I\nARIDI Vol.02 - Initial Caps II\nARIDI Vol.03 - Historical Ornaments Patterns and Frames\nARIDI Vol.04 - Arabesque Ornaments\nARIDI Vol.05 - Arabesque Borders\nARIDI Vol.06 - Olde World Borders I\nARIDI Vol.07 - Initial Caps III\nARIDI Vol.08 - Calligraphia\nARIDI Vol.09 - Olde World Ornaments\nARIDI Vol.10 - Ribbons Banners and Frames\nARIDI Vol.11 - Ornamental Backgrounds\nARIDI Vol.12 - Initial Caps IV\nARIDI Vol.13 - Certificates and Awards Borders\nARIDI Vol.14 - Crests Ribbons and Frames\nARIDI Vol.15 - Typography and Printers Ornaments\nARIDI Vol.16 - Aridi Fiesta\nARIDI Vol.17 - Business I\nARIDI Vol.18 - Backgrounds (Discontinued and combined with Backgrounds II)\nARIDI Vol.18 - Backgrounds II (formerly Vol.34 and Backgrounds I)\nARIDI Vol.19 - Arabesque Designs\nARIDI Vol.20 - Olde World Borders III\nARIDI Vol.21 - Backgrounds III\nARIDI Vol.22 - Olde World Ornaments II\nARIDI Vol.23 - Frames and Banners\nARIDI Vol.24 - Calligraphia II\nARIDI Vol.25 - Olde World Borders IV\nARIDI Vol.26 - Backgrounds IV\nARIDI Vol.27 - Calligraphia III\nARIDI Vol.28 - Arabesque Designs II\nARIDI Vol.29 - Arabesque Designs III\nARIDI Vol.30 - Olde World Borders\nARIDI Vol.31 - Arabesque Masterpieces\nARIDI Vol.32 - WebClips\nARIDI Vol.33 - Designer Fonts Collection\nARIDI Vol.34 - Seamless Dreams (Discontinued and combined with Vol.18)\nARIDI Vol.35 - Arabic Calligraphy Art\nARIDI Vol.36 - Arab Caps and Fonts\nARIDI Vol.37 - Arabic Greetings\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a9deee5612641383dea6a5ac25d2c77f759f83c","amp;dn":"Aridi+Vector+EPS+Clipart+Collection+all+38+Original+Volumes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a9deee5612641383dea6a5ac25d2c77f759f83c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,157,238,229,97,38,65,56,61,234,106,90,194,93,44,119,247,89,248,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
