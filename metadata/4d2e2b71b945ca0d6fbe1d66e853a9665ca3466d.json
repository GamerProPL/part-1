An outspoken critic of the occupation, Dr. Riyadh is equally passionate about building democracy in Iraq. Yet all around him, he sees only chaos, as him waiting room fills each day with patients suffering the physical and mental effects of ever-increasing violence. Dramatically interwoven into his personal journey is the landscape of U.S. military occupation, Australian private security contractors and the U.N. officials who orchestrated the elections. Luminously photographed and emotionally complex, My Country, My Country captures the downward spiral of one man caught in the tragic contradictions of the U.S. occupation of Iraq and its project to spread democracy in the Middle East","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d2e2b71b945ca0d6fbe1d66e853a9665ca3466d","amp;dn":"My+country%2C+my+country+%5BWith+Special+features%5D+Mkv+X264+2006+Poi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d2e2b71b945ca0d6fbe1d66e853a9665ca3466d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,46,43,113,185,69,202,13,111,190,29,102,232,83,169,102,92,163,70,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
