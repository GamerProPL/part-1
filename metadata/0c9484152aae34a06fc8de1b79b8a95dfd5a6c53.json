His best-known novels are MONEY (1984) and LONDON FIELDS (1989).  He received the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his memoir EXPERIENCE (2000) and has been listed for the Booker Prize twice to date (shortlisted in 1991 for TIME'S ARROW and longlisted in 2003 for YELLOW DOG).  The Times named him in 2008 as one of the 50 greatest British writers since 1945.\n\nAmis has been portrayed as a master of what the New York Times called &quot;the new unpleasantness&quot;.
