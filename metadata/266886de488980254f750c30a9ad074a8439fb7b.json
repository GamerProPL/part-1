Since their preview of the track during WMC this year in Miami, to their stellar performance at the Electric Daisy Carnival at the end of June, the funky fresh new groove from Duck Sauce (A-Trak + Armand Van Helden) has left many dj's in a frenzy to find the original track, with only remixes, bootlegs, edits and rips left to savour our audio appetites until it would finally surface. But behold, in all its 320 real glory, the true original mix.\n\nI've also included the &quot;Audiobot Edit&quot; &amp; &quot;O-God Remix&quot;.\n\n01 Barbara Streisand (Original Mix)  5:00\n02 Barbara Streisand (Audiobot Edit) 5:16\n03 Barbara Streisand (O-God Remix)   4:32\n\nTitle: Duck Sauce - Barbra Streisand (DJ Promo)\nGenre: House\nYear: 2010\nFormat: .mp3\nQuality: CBR 320kb/s\nAudio: 2ch stereo\nBitrate: 44.1khz\nMixed: No\nTags: Yes\nCovers: Front\nLength: 19:48\nSize: 34MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:266886de488980254f750c30a9ad074a8439fb7b","amp;dn":"Duck+Sauce+-+Barbara+Streisand+%28DJ+Promo%29+320kbps+%5BDeZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"266886de488980254f750c30a9ad074a8439fb7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,104,134,222,72,137,128,37,79,117,12,48,169,173,7,74,132,57,251,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
