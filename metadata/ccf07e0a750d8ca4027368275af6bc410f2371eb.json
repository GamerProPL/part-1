There are no other musicians closely related with project (excepting several session appearances), and all instruments and vocals sounding on Frozen Ocean records are played by Vaarwel. Project was formed at the end of 2005, never was over, and from birth to now is located in Moscow, Russia.\n\nFrozen Ocean does not support any political, social, religious or philosophic conceptions. According this, all music and art of project is devoted only to things related with authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thoughts, images, feelings and associations, and does not propagandize anything except Darkness and Death.\n\nFrozen Ocean is in opposition to modern fashion-like orthodox/religious devil-worshipping black metal trend owing to its absolute identity with abrahamic religions and their blindness, stupidity and external attribute oriented pathos.\n\nFrozen Ocean does not: give any interviews, play live sets, support any merch and any special editions of released albums (box-sets etc.), participate in compilations anymore.\n\nFrozen Ocean does: play good music, help listeners to obtain projectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s releases, make split releases, collaborate with designers for good artwork.\n\n\n1.

I said at the time that I did not expect it to be too long before I heard from Vaarwel the artist behind this Russian project again and sure enough Ã¢â‚¬Ëœa Perfect SolitudeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ recently landed. Of course, I again was not sure what to expect from this musically but at first my eyes were transfixed by the fantastic cover art and questions started buzzing round my head. The solitude is certainly served up by the illustration, it is bleak and bereft. So too however is the dread and I am reminded a bit of the somewhat grim and ghastly cover to 2004 album Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Black HouseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ by Krieg. What manner of monster dwells in this shack and what terrible crimes have they committed; my imagination was running wild. It is worth mentioning that if you check out the website linked below you will find some wallpaper to accompany this artwork too.\n\nApparently this is a very personal album and one that confronts the fear of being alone, not just in living but in dying too and it is one that I am sure we have all spent time reflecting on.\n\nWe enter this barren void through the Ã¢â‚¬ËœBroken WindowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ it is a window long since shattered and one that lies in disrepair if the maudlin sparse guitar tone is anything to go by. Wind and rain fill the gaps as the intro piece flows into Ã¢â‚¬ËœSomewhere Clouds Debark.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Lush sparkling keyboard sets up a structure and guitars bit in with quite a gothic sound that is not a million miles from Fields Of The Nephilim at their most ponderous. I was almost expecting this to be completely instrumental but somewhat despondent vocals mournfully join in. The vocals work well as far as the subject matter is concerned as they are so emotionless, they are there and monotone and it is a weird way of delivering them although I suspect purposeful. There is a bit of Tiamat behind it all and little in the way of hope. From here on in the next few tracks leave the vocals completely alone. Ã¢â‚¬ËœA Sunflower On The Prison BackyardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is gorgeous and epic at 13 minutes, prepare to be entranced. Ambiance builds as does the lush tinkle of what sounds like a xylophone being ever so gently tapped. There is a real spatial feel to this, lots of room to breathe and the music quietly sparkles. Fuzzy drone, doom etched guitars suddenly hammer in, still very slow but incredibly heavy and it brings with it a contrasting claustrophobia. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best to settle back and go with the flow. It all evolves as the next track Ã¢â‚¬ËœMare ImbriumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ follows. It is like the musical equivalent of star gazing and the glittery, winking keyboard sounds are like the stars glistening in the cold night frost. The actual track title refers to a large moon crater so we are perhaps looking towards earth from there, although it is doubtful it has hosted life for countless aeons. Still you cannot get a place that offers much more solitude than this. This follows on nicely from the space watching sounds of Ã¢â‚¬ËœOneiric In GeocentricismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and really is music that has a feel of an astronomer watching the skies.\n\nAfter this Ã¢â‚¬ËœUnavailing Steps on PerpetualÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ brings a sudden burst of melody and more vocals this time with more harmony about them. I am reminded a bit of a mix of Hawkwind and Falkenbach here it has a psychedelic galloping tinge about it and really stands out as a structured number compared to what has come before it. The fact it is quite joyous is a surprise too, perhaps the muse has become at one with their solitude. It is left for the strangely entitled Ã¢â‚¬ËœCleavage and EmissionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ another instrumental to finish the album. I hear sirens in it and quite every time think they are outside my window, a natural occurrence. Is this perhaps the return to normality and the urban sprawl, or is it the sounds of life flashing through your head before life is extinguished. The last sound you hear is a machine going flat line, so I think perhaps so. This again has been another fascinating journey into the mind of Vaarwel.\n\nIt looks like it will not be too long before we hear again either as Vannviddsanger the second part of his conceptual Norse trilogy is apparently next.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy and please SEED!\nGenre:\tBlack\nSubgenre:\tAtmospheric Black Metal / Ambient\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t100.93 MB \t\n7 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccf07e0a750d8ca4027368275af6bc410f2371eb","amp;dn":"Frozen+Ocean+-+A+Perfect+Solitude+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccf07e0a750d8ca4027368275af6bc410f2371eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,240,126,10,117,13,140,164,2,115,104,39,90,246,188,65,15,35,113,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
