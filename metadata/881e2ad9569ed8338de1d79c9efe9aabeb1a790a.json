This documentary follows the assault on the record by Steve Wiebe, an earnest teacher from Washington who took up the game while unemployed. The top scores are monitored by a cadre of players and fans associated with Walter Day, an Iowan who runs Funspot, an annual tournament. Wiebe breaks Mitchell's record in public at Funspot, and Mitchell promptly mails a video tape of himself setting a new record. So Wiebe travels to Florida hoping Mitchell will face him for the 2007 Guinness World Records. Will the mind-game-playing Mitchell engage; who will end up holding the record?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:881e2ad9569ed8338de1d79c9efe9aabeb1a790a","amp;dn":"The.King.of.Kong.2007.LIMITED.Documentary.DVDRip.XviD-SeRbOvItCh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"881e2ad9569ed8338de1d79c9efe9aabeb1a790a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,30,42,217,86,158,216,51,141,225,215,156,158,254,154,171,235,26,121,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
