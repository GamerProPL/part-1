February 15, 1999), better known by\n his stage name Big L, was an American rapper. Big L was born,     \n raised, lived, and fatally shot in the same New York City         \n neighborhood, Harlem, which frequently appeared in his rhymes. He \n is mostly remembered for his freestyling, storytelling,           \n punchlines, his critically acclaimed debut album Lifestylez Ov Da \n Poor &amp; Dangerous, and his murder at the age of 24. He is          \n remembered to some in Harlem as &quot;The 3rd King&quot; (Tupac and The     \n Notorious B.I.G. assumingly being the other two).                 \n===================================================================\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58ec1ef19d75538ff01b7218958f640de092ca97","amp;dn":"Big+L+-+The+Big+Picture+%282000%29+%5B320+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58ec1ef19d75538ff01b7218958f640de092ca97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,236,30,241,157,117,83,143,240,27,114,24,149,143,100,13,224,146,202,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
