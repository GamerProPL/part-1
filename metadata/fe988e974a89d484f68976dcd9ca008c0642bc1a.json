Born in Ottawa, Ontario, in 1941 to parents of Lebanese Christian descent who owned a local restaurant, Anka proved a child prodigy, beginning his show business life at the age of 12 as an impressionist. By the age of 14, he was stealing the family car to drive to amateur singing contests in nearby Hull, Quebec, and writing his own songs. His first single, &quot;I Confess,&quot; appeared on the Riviera subsidiary of Jules and Joe Bihari's RPM label. While on a trip to New York with a group of friends who sang as the Rover Boys, Anka gained an audition with ABC producer Don Costa, and sang his own composition, &quot;Diana,&quot; an ode to a former babysitter. Costa liked what he heard, recorded the teenager, and watched as the single hit number one on both sides of the Atlantic later in 1957, eventually selling a reported ten million copies worldwide. \n\n\nGenre................: Pop\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Rhino\nIncluded.............: Covers, Lossless Audiochecker, Accurip Log, Cue\n\n01.Diana\n02.You Are My Destiny\n03.Crazy Love\n04.Let The Bells Keep Ringing\n05.The Teen Commandments\n06.(All Of A Sudden) My Heart Sings\n07.Lonely Boy\n08.Put Your Head On My Shoulder\n09.It's Time To Cry\n10.Puppy Love\n11.My Home Town\n12.Summer's Gone\n13.Tonight My Love, Tonight\n14.Dance On Little Girl\n15.Love Me Warm And Tender\n16.Eso Beso (That Kiss!)\n17.Goodnight My Love\n18.Jubilation\n19.(You're) Having My Baby\n20.One Woman Man\n21.I Don't Like To Sleep Alone\n22.(I Believe) There's Nothing Stronger Than Our Love\n23.Times Of Your Life\n24.My Way\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe988e974a89d484f68976dcd9ca008c0642bc1a","amp;dn":"Paul+Anka+-+His+All+Time+Greatest+Hits+%281989%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe988e974a89d484f68976dcd9ca008c0642bc1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,152,142,151,74,137,212,132,246,137,118,220,217,202,0,140,6,66,188,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
