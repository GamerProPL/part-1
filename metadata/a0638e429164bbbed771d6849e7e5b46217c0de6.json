After Universal executives saw a test screening of Unfriended terrify a test audience, the studio acquired the thriller that was developed and conceived by visionary filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter). Directed by Levan Gabriadze, Unfriended is written by Nelson Greaves and produced by Bekmambetov and Greaves, as well as Jason Blum for Blumhouse Productions (Ouija and Paranormal Activity, The Purge and Insidious series).\n\nDirector: Levan Gabriadze\n\nWriters: Nelson Greaves\n\nActors: Shelly Hennig, Moses Jacob Storm, Renee Olstead, Will Peltz, Jacob Wysocki, Courtney Halverson, Heather Sossaman\n\nGenre: Thriller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0638e429164bbbed771d6849e7e5b46217c0de6","amp;dn":"Unfriended.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0638e429164bbbed771d6849e7e5b46217c0de6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,99,142,66,145,100,187,190,215,113,214,132,158,126,91,70,33,124,13,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
