What he lacked in charisma and photogenic looks, Orbison made up for in spades with his quavering operatic voice and melodramatic narratives of unrequited love and yearning. In the process, he established rock &amp; roll archetypes of the underdog and the hopelessly romantic loser. These were not only amplified by peers such as Del Shannon and Gene Pitney, but also influenced future generations of roots rockers such as Bruce Springsteen and Chris Isaak, as well as modern country stars the Mavericks.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Oh, Pretty Woman\n02.Only The Lonely (Know The Way I Feel)\n03.In Dreams\n04.Uptown\n05.Blue Angel\n06.Crying\n07.Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)\n08.Ooby Dooby\n09.Let The Good Times Roll\n10.Candy Man\n11.Blue Bayou\n12.Running Scared\n13.Mean Woman Blues\n14.Shahdaroba\n15.Leah\n16.Crawling Back\n17.It's Too Late\n18.Tryin' To Get To You\n19.A True Love Goodbye\n20.You're Gonna Cry\n21.Rock House\n22.You're My Baby\n23.Mean Little Mama\n24.Sweet And Easy To Love\n25.(I'd Be) A Legend In My Time\n26.Love Hurts\n27.Lana\n28.The Crowd\n29.The Actress\n30.Borne On The Wind\n31.All I Have To Do Is Dream\n32.Love Storm (Demo Recording)\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.You Got It\n02.California Blue\n03.In Dreams (1987 Version)\n04.Not Alone Any More\n05.Mama\n06.Unchained Melody\n07.Coming Home\n08.Waymore's Blues\n09.She's A Mystery To Me\n10.A Love So Beautiful\n11.Hound Dog Man\n12.Oh, Pretty Woman (Live Version)\n13.(All I Can Do Is) Dream You (Live Version)\n14.You're The One\n15.Crying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
