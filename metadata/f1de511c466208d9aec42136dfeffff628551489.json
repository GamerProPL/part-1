In between, they became one of the top-tier acts on a label with no shortage of talent, ranking with the Temptations and the Supremes as Motown's most consistent hitmakers. Where many other R&amp;B vocal groups spotlighted a tenor-range lead singer, the Four Tops were fronted by deep-voiced Levi Stubbs, who never cut a solo record outside of the group. Stubbs had all the grit of a pleading, wailing, gospel-trained soul belter, but at the same time, the Tops' creamy harmonies were smooth enough for Motown's radio-friendly pop-soul productions. From 1964-1967, the Four Tops recorded some of the Holland-Dozier-Holland team's greatest compositions, including &quot;Reach Out, I'll Be There,&quot; &quot;I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch),&quot; &quot;Standing in the Shadows of Love,&quot; &quot;Bernadette,&quot; and &quot;Baby I Need Your Loving.&quot; The group's fortunes took a downturn when their chief source of material left the label, but they enjoyed a renaissance in the early '70s, which saw them switching to the ABC-Dunhill imprint. Regardless of commercial fortunes, they kept on performing and touring, scoring the occasional comeback hit.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tSoul and R&amp;B\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n\n01.Reach Out I'll Be There (Original Version)\n02.I Can't Help Myself\n03.It's The Same Old Song\n04.7 Rooms Of Gloom\n05.Standing In The Shadows Of Love\n06.Walk Away Renee\n07.Yesterday's Dreams\n08.Bernadette\n09.I'm In A Different World\n10.Do What You Gotta Do\n11.It's All In The Game\n12.River Deep Mountain High\n13.Still Water (Love)\n14.You Keep Running Away\n15.If I Were A Carpenter\n16.Just Seven Numbers (Can Straighten Out My Life)\n17.Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever\n18.What Is A Man\n19.Simple Game\n20.Reach Out I'll Be There (PWL Remix)\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1de511c466208d9aec42136dfeffff628551489","amp;dn":"The+Four+Tops+-+Motown%5C%27s+Greatest+Hits+%281992%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1de511c466208d9aec42136dfeffff628551489","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,222,81,28,70,98,8,217,174,196,33,54,223,239,255,246,40,85,20,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
