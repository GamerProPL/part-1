Be more creative and\ndangerous in 1v1 opportunities.\n\n1st Touch Control - A new system transforms the way players control the\nball, eliminating near-perfect touch for every player, and creating more\nopportunities for defenders to capitalise on errant balls and poor touches\nto win back possession.\n\n1.
