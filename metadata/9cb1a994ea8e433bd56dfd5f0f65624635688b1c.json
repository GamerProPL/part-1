But the application has many more goodies under its hood.\nThe computer scanning process takes less than a minute, while fixing them might exceed 10 minutes, depending on the number of problems and their nature.\nAVG PC Tuneup can thus fix registry errors such as file associations, file extensions, help files, history lists, shortcuts and installed software, but also remove junk files and deal with fragmented files.\nOn the other hand, the 'System Advisor' tab comes with a bunch of useful advices on the way you could improve computer performance. For example, it recommended us during the test to disable administrative share and autorun, thus improving system security on two different fronts.\nThe resource usage section provides an overview over the way your computer resources are being used by the running processes, which means you can easily discover which of the apps need a bigger amount of CPU and memory.\nLast but not least, the advanced tools tab comes with several new tools such as disk cleanup and defrag, duplicate remover, system tweaks and service optimizer, file recovery and shredder, Internet booster and history eraser.\nAVG PC Tuneup works on a reasonable amount of computer resources, although it may eat up your CPU and RAM when trying to solve some of the detected problems.\n\nFeatures :\n\n\nDisk Cleaner:\nRemoves junk files slowing down your computer\nDisk Defrag:\nDefragments disk drives and optimizes system files placement\nRegistry Cleaner:\nRepairs thousands of registry errors to increase PC stability\nRegistry Defrag:\nCompacts the registry eliminating memory-consuming gaps\nDisk Doctor:\nFinds bad sectors, lost clusters and directory errors and fixes them\nInternet Optimizer:\nTailors the one-size-fits-all settings to your specific Internet connection\nTrack Eraser:\nRemoves the history of your computer and Internet usage\nDisk Wipe:\nWipes free space on disks to prevent the recovery of sensitive data\nFile Shredder:\nErases selected files beyond recovery on a disk or USB stick\nFile Recovery:\nRecovers accidentally deleted files from disks, USB sticks or cameras\nDuplicate File Finder:\nHelps to find and remove duplicate files that waste disk space\nServices Manager:\nDisables unnecessary services slowing down your computer\nStartup Manager:\nAllows to manage programs that start automatically on Windows boot\nUninstall Manager:\nCompletely uninstalls the software programs that you\nno longer need\nTweak Manager:\nAllows to tune hundreds of Windows settings to increase your PC speed\nTask Manager:\nLists all running processes, services and locked files\nDisk Explorer:\nShows which files take up the most space on your computer\nSystem Information:\nProvides detailed information about your hardware and software.\n\nSystem Requirements :\n\nWindows : XP/ XP Pro x64/ Vista /Vista x64 Edition /7 /7 x64 /8 x32 /8 x64\nLanguage : AVG PC TuneUp\nChinese (simplified) Czech Dutch English (US) French German Italian Japanese Korean Polish Portuguese (BR) Portuguese (EU) Russian Spanish (EU)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cb1a994ea8e433bd56dfd5f0f65624635688b1c","amp;dn":"AVG+PC+Tuneup+2015+15.0.1001.471+%2B+Keys+%2B+Keygen+-+AppzDam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cb1a994ea8e433bd56dfd5f0f65624635688b1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,177,169,148,234,142,67,59,213,109,253,95,15,101,98,70,53,104,139,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
