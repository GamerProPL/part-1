The series is a spin-off from Davies' 2005 revival of the long-running science fiction programme Doctor Who, which has a family audience. Torchwood, however, is aimed at a mature audience.\nIt follows the exploits of a small team of alien-hunters, who make up the Cardiff branch of the fictional Torchwood Institute, which deals mainly with incidents involving extraterrestrials. Its central character is Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), an immortal and ex-conman from the distant future who has lived on Earth since the 19th century.\nThe branch is initially a team of five operatives, led by Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), with Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) as the &quot;new girl&quot; who joins in the first episode and acts as an audience surrogate. Owen Harper (Burn Gorman) is the unit's medical officer and Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) is the resident computer specialist, while &quot;administrative&quot; duties are performed by Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd).\nIt's a fantastic show worth watching - especially if you like Doctor Who, because there are several cross-overs, which just complete the universal experience of the whole &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-universe! \n\n\n\nFormat :\tXviD\nFile size:  \t389 MiB avg. per episode\nDuration : \t49 min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t624 pixels\nHeight : \t352 pixels\nAspect ratio : \t16:9\nFrame rate : \t25 fps\nAudio: \t\tMP3\nNr. of Files:\t31 + 1 TitlePic + 1 manOtor'sKABLAM!!!-Trailer + 1 link.txt\n\n\nAll files properly named.\nThis pack wouldn't have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++VTV+++scenebalance+++TorrentDay+++eztv+++\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n\n######################  You like your show in one pack?  ########################\n##############################  Here you go!  ###################################\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3df201cb6d3fbd7f2e916ec80790ee129138148","amp;dn":"Torchwood+-+The+Complete+Season+1%2C2+and+3+%5BHDTV%5D%28Xvid%2FMP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3df201cb6d3fbd7f2e916ec80790ee129138148","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,223,32,28,182,211,251,215,242,233,22,236,128,121,14,225,41,19,129,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
