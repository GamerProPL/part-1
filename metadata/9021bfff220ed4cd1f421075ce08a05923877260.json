Now, once again, Daniel Goleman has written a groundbreaking synthesis of the latest findings in biology and brain science, revealing that we are Ã¢â‚¬Å“wired to connectÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the surprisingly deep impact of our relationships on every aspect of our lives.\n\nFar more than we are consciously aware, our daily encounters with parents, spouses, bosses, and even strangers shape our brains and affect cells throughout our bodiesÃ¢â‚¬â€down to the level of our genesÃ¢â‚¬â€for good or ill. In Social Intelligence, Daniel Goleman explores an emerging new science with startling implications for our interpersonal world. Its most fundamental discovery: we are designed for sociability, constantly engaged in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“neural balletÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that connects us brain to brain with those around us.\n\nOur reactions to others, and theirs to us, have a far-reaching biological impact, sending out cascades of hormones that regulate everything from our hearts to our immune systems, making good relationships act like vitaminsÃ¢â‚¬â€and bad relationships like poisons. We can Ã¢â‚¬Å“catchÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ other peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s emotions the way we catch a cold, and the consequences of isolation or relentless social stress can be life-shortening. Goleman explains the surprising accuracy of first impressions, the basis of charisma and emotional power, the complexity of sexual attraction, and how we detect lies. He describes the Ã¢â‚¬Å“dark sideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of social intelligence, from narcissism to Machiavellianism and psychopathy. He also reveals our astonishing capacity for Ã¢â‚¬Å“mindsight,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as well as the tragedy of those, like autistic children, whose mindsight is impaired.\n\nIs there a way to raise our children to be happy? What is the basis of a nourishing marriage? How can business leaders and teachers inspire the best in those they lead and teach? How can groups divided by prejudice and hatred come to live together in peace?\n\nThe answers to these questions may not be as elusive as we once thought. And Goleman delivers his most heartening news with powerful conviction: we humans have a built-in bias toward empathy, cooperation, and altruismÃ¢â‚¬â€œprovided we develop the social intelligence to nurture these capacities in ourselves and others.\n\nGenre: Non-fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9021bfff220ed4cd1f421075ce08a05923877260","amp;dn":"Social+Intelligence+-+Daniel+Goleman.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9021bfff220ed4cd1f421075ce08a05923877260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,33,191,255,34,14,212,205,31,66,16,117,206,8,160,89,35,135,114,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
