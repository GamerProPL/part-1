It's even rated T for Teen due to its comic violence. Nevertheless, with cute characters like Tom the tomcat and his mouse pal/archenemy, Jerry, the game's target audience definitely isn't the same as the one flocking to the latest iterations of Tekken or Virtua Fighter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:451678fa8224ef462620dab3a12aefc1e9baf309","amp;dn":"Tom+And+Jerry+In+War+Of+The+Whiskers+%5BPS2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"451678fa8224ef462620dab3a12aefc1e9baf309","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,22,120,250,130,36,239,70,38,32,218,179,161,42,239,193,233,186,243,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
