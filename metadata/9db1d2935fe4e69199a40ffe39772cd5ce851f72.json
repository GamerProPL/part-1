I saw that there was no decent attempt at completely covering both 'Court of Owls' and 'Night of the Owls' out there, so here it is.\n\nI didn't scan any of these myself, just rearranged a bunch of scans from a bunch of sources. All credit goes to the original scanners whose individual efforts I've left on each file [Except One Unknown]. As is always the case, if you like what you read, go out and support the comic book industry by buying it!\n\nAll of this is extensively in the 'Read Me' files with the pack but what the heck...\n\nIncluded Files:\n``````````````` \n~ All-Star Western #09 - #12\n~ Batgirl #09\n~ Batman #01 - #12 + #00\n~ Batman &amp; Robin #09\n~ Batman Annual #01\n~ Batman: The Dark Knight #09\n~ Batwing #09\n~ Birds of Prey #09\n~ Catwoman #09\n~ Detective Comics #09\n~ Justice League #08\n~ Nightwing #01 - #09\n~ Red Hood &amp; The Outlaws #09\n\n\nThe Reading Order:\n``````````````````\nFirst there's 'Court of Owls' which is a prelude to the cross over event 'Night of the Owls'. Night of the Owls is tricky in that it splits the story up in hours, so the more adventurous amongst you might want to read the event in complete chronological order by jumping between books. If that is something you fancy, or if that sounds like too much hassle, whatever, I've included two Reading Orders. A simple one with the books in a &quot;close as possible&quot; line up, and a more complex one that jumps between books, following the action in time chronological order.\n\nThe files for 'Night of the Owls' are sorted as listed in the Simple reading order, you'll have to do the issue jumping, if you choose to do so, yourself. I have tried to make it as easy as possible for you without cutting up the book's files.\n\nAny errors or suggested improvements in the reading order(s)? Let me know in the comments.\n\nHere they are ...\n\n\n01 Court of Owls (Prelude)\n\n01 - 06: Batman #01 - #06\n07 - 12: Nightwing #01 - #06 (Optional)\n13 - --: Justice League #08 (Optional)\n\n\n02a Night of the Owls (Simple Reading Order)\n\n01 - Nightwing #07\n02 - Batman #07\n03 - Batman #08\n04 - Red Hood &amp; the Outlaws #08\n05 - Batwing #09\n06 - Nightwing #08\n07 - Batman &amp; Robin #09\n08 - Batgirl #09\n09 - Batman #09\n10 - Red Hood &amp; the Outlaws #09\n11 - Nightwing #09 (You may enjoy it more if you read it back-to-back with #08)\n12 - Detective Comics #09\n13 - Batman: The Dark Knight #09\n14 - Birds of Prey #09\n15 - Batman Annual #01\n16 - Catwoman #09\n\n\n02b Night of the Owls (Complicated Reading Order)\n\nSo the coding goes: 'Reading Order' - 'File Name Number (i.e. Same as Simple Order's Number)' - 'Time in Book' - 'Book Title + Number' \n\n01 - 01 - N/A - Nightwing #07\n02 - 02 - N/A - Batman #07\n03 - 05 - 1630 - Batwing #09\n04 - 16 - 1724 - Catwoman #09\n05 - 05 - 1802 - Batwing #09\n06 - 08 - 1807 - Batgirl #09\n07 - 03 - 1901 - Batman #08\n08 - 16 - 1904 - Catwoman #09\n09 - 08 - 1904 - Batgirl #09\n10 - 03 - 1932 - Batman #08\n11 - 07 - 1938 - Batman &amp; Robin #09\n12 - 05 - 1940 - Batwing #09\n13 - 06 - 1940 - Nightwing #08\n14 - 04 - 1940 - Red Hood &amp; The Outlaws #08\n15 - 09 - 1951 - Batman #09\n16 - 10 - 2018 - Red Hood &amp; The Outlaws #09\n17 - 14 - 2020 - Birds of Prey #09\n18 - 11 - 2022 - Nightwing #09\n19 - 12 - 2026 - Detective Comics #09\n20 - 09 - 2036 - Batman #09\n21 - 12 - 2051 - Detective Comics #09\n22 - 10 - 2053 - Red Hood &amp; The Outlaws #09\n23 - 14 - 2103 - Birds of Prey #09\n24 - 12 - 2149 - Detective Comics #09\n25 - 13 - 2255 - Batman: The Dark Knight #09\n26 - 09 - 2302 - Batman #09\n27 - 13 - 0000 - Batman: The Dark Knight #09\n28 - 15 - 0002 - Batman Annual #01\n29 - 16 - 0203 - Catwoman #09\n\n\n03 Court of Owls Finale (Prologue)\n\n01 - Batman #10\n02 - Batman #11\n\n\n04 The War of Lords and Owls (Optional)\n\n01 - All-Star Western #09\n02 - All-Star Western #10\n03 - All-Star Western #11\n04 - All-Star Western #12\n\n\n05 Bridge to DotF (Optional)\n\n01 - Batman #12\n02 - Batman #00\n\n\nLastly, I've also thrown in Batman #12 and the Batman #00 zero issue so that anyone planning on reading this and then going straight into the 'Death of the Family' cross over afterwards can do just that. :)\n\nLastly, part two :/ ... Keep seeding it please folks. Let's get this thing some momentum so that more people can enjoy this kick ass story!\n\nLastly III, eeesh... I'm putting together a Before Watchmen pack that arranges all of the books in order of both release (and therefore back-up story) order, and in individual character title order at the same time. As soon as the eventual last book is released I'll get that finished and posted too. Enjoy.\n\n\n~ jon2d2\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9db1d2935fe4e69199a40ffe39772cd5ce851f72","amp;dn":"The+Complete+%27Court+of+Owls%27+and+%27Night+of+the+Owls%27+Batman+Cros","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9db1d2935fe4e69199a40ffe39772cd5ce851f72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,177,210,147,95,228,230,145,153,164,15,254,57,119,44,213,206,133,31,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
