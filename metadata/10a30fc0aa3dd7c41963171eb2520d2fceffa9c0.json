Despite many lineup changes, occasional splits within the group, and the ever-changing trends in popular music, the band have continued for more than 40 years and still retain a large following. They have sold over 30 million albums. The band's music blends symphonic and other classical structures with their own brand of rock music.\nAlthough the band's sole consistent member has been bass player Chris Squire, Yes are also generally noted for the distinctive high-register vocals of former lead singer Jon Anderson and the eclectic musical stylings of a succession of guitarists (Steve Howe, Peter Banks, Trevor Rabin, Billy Sherwood), keyboard players (Rick Wakeman, Tony Kaye, Patrick Moraz, Geoff Downes, Igor Khoroshev, Oliver Wakeman), and drummers (Alan White and Bill Bruford). Several band members became celebrated musicians and/or bandleaders in their own right, and a 1980 lineup of the band was briefly fronted by Trevor Horn (shortly before he became one of rock music's most celebrated record producers). The band's current lineup includes Squire, Howe, White, Oliver Wakeman (keyboards) and BenoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â®t David (lead vocals)\n\n.: Yes Group :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ondarock.it/images/monografie/yes1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ondarock.it/images/monografie/yes1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nSTUDIO\n1969 Yes (Remastered and Expanded) @320\n1970 Time And A Word (Remastered and Expanded) @320\n1971 Fragile (Remastered and Expanded) @320\n1971 The Yes Album (Remastered and Expanded) @320\n1972 Close To The Edge (Remastered and Expanded) @320\n1973 Tales From Topographic Oceans (Remastered and Expanded) (2 CD) @320\n1974 Relayer (Remastered and Expanded) @320\n1977 Going For The One (Remastered and Expanded) @320\n1978 Tormato (Remastered and Expanded) @320\n1980 Drama (Remastered and Expanded) @320\n1983 90125 (Remastered and Expanded) @320\n1987 Big Generator (Remastered and Expanded) @320\n1991 Union @320\n1994 Talk @320\n1997 Open Your Eyes @320\n1999 The Ladder @320\n2001 Magnification @320\n\nLIVE ALBUMS\n1973 YesSongs (2 CD) @320\n1980 YesShows (2 CD) @320\n1985 9012 Live The Solos @320\n1996 Keys To Ascension (2 CD) @320\n1997 Keys To Ascension 2 (2 CD) @320\n1998 Beyond And Before (The BBC Recordings 1969-1970) (2 CD) @320\n2000 House Of Yes - Live From House Of Blues (2 CD) @320\n\nCOMPILATION ALBUMS\n1974 Yesterdays @320\n1981 Classic Yes @320\n1987 The Best Of Yes (1970-1987) @320\n1991 YesYears (BoxSet) (4 CD) @320\n1998 Friends &amp; Relatives Vol 1 (2 CD) @320\n1998 Friends &amp; Relatives Vol 2 (2 CD) @320\n2001 Keystudio @320\n2004 The Ultimate Yes (35th Anniversary) (3 CD) @320\n\nREMIX\n2003 Remixes @320\n\nOTHER ALBUMS &amp; LIVE\n1971 Perpetual Change (Bootleg, Hiwatt) @320\n1985 Live The Solos ( Bootleg) @320\n1991 Union Tour (Live) @320\n1994 The Yes Solo Family Album (YES Members) @320\n2002 Konocti (Field Amphitheatre Kelseyville CA USA) (2 CD) @320\n2002 Symphonic Live @320\n2002 The Encore Collection Extended Versions (Live) @320\n2007 Live At Montreux 2003 (2 CD) @320\n2009 Live At Hammersmith Apollo (Nov 17th) (2 CD) @320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10a30fc0aa3dd7c41963171eb2520d2fceffa9c0","amp;dn":"YES+-+Discography+1969-2009+%5BMp3+320+kbps%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10a30fc0aa3dd7c41963171eb2520d2fceffa9c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,163,15,192,170,61,215,196,25,99,23,30,178,82,13,47,206,255,169,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
