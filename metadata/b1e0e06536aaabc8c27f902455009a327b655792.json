Tarantino accused agents for one of the three actors he had met with for parts Ã¢â‚¬â€ Bruce Dern, Tim Roth and Michael Madsen Ã¢â‚¬â€ though he seemed to suspect it was DernÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s team at CAA.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1e0e06536aaabc8c27f902455009a327b655792","amp;dn":"The+Hateful+Eight+Leaked+Script+-+Quentin+Tarantino.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1e0e06536aaabc8c27f902455009a327b655792","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,224,224,101,54,170,171,200,194,127,144,36,85,0,154,50,123,101,87,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
