Fired by Richard's passion for the rich history of the dazzling Byzantine Empire - centred around the legendary Constantinople - we are swept into some of the most extraordinary tales in history. The clash of civilizations, the fall of empires, the rise of Christianity, revenge, lust, murder. Turbulent stories from the past are brought vividly to life at the same time as a father navigates the unfolding changes in his relationship with his son.\r\n\r\nGHOST EMPIRE is a revelation: a beautifully written ode to a lost civilization, and a warmly observed father-son adventure far from home","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29d14600ebc3762d07916f86f76a21547f438208","amp;dn":"Ghost+Empire%3A+The+Story+of+Constantinople","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29d14600ebc3762d07916f86f76a21547f438208","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,209,70,0,235,195,118,45,7,145,111,134,247,106,33,84,127,67,130,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
