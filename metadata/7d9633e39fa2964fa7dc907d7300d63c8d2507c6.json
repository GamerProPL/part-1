Murphy may not be in the same style of performance as Anderson, but no one can deny that back in 1983 he galvanized an audience as few other comedians could. Occasionally there's a PG bit involving Eddie's family, but for the most part the humor is raunchy -- as evidenced by Murphy's routine about Ralph Kramden being &quot;serviced&quot; by Ed Norton. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 10 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d9633e39fa2964fa7dc907d7300d63c8d2507c6","amp;dn":"Eddie+Murphy%3ADelirious%281983%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d9633e39fa2964fa7dc907d7300d63c8d2507c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,150,51,227,159,162,150,79,167,220,144,125,115,0,214,60,141,37,7,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
