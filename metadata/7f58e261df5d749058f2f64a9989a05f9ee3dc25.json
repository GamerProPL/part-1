While the band has been through several personnel      \n changes, singer, guitarist, and songwriter Mikael Ãƒâ€¦kerfeldt has   \n remained Opeth&amp;#039;s driving force since joining shortly after its    \n inception.                                                        \n                                                                   \n While firmly rooted in Scandinavian death metal, Opeth            \n incorporates progressive metal, progressive rock, folk, blues and \n jazz into their usually lengthy songs. Many compositions include  \n acoustic guitars and strong dynamic shifts, as well as growling   \n and clean vocals. The band occasionaly played live to support the \n first four albums, though later conducted its first world tour    \n after the release of 2001&amp;#039;s Blackwater Park.                      \n                                                                   \n Opeth has released eight studio albums, two live albums, one box  \n set, and a DVD. The band released its debut album Orchid in 1995, \n after a year of delays, but did not experience commercial success \n until the 2003 release Damnation, which debuted at number 192 on  \n the Billboard 200. The band&amp;#039;s ninth studio album, Watershed, is   \n due for release on June 3, 2008.                                  \n===================================================================\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f58e261df5d749058f2f64a9989a05f9ee3dc25","amp;dn":"Opeth+-+Damnation+%282003%29+%5B320+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f58e261df5d749058f2f64a9989a05f9ee3dc25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,88,226,97,223,93,116,144,88,242,246,74,153,137,160,95,158,227,220,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
