A children's book that offered the first glimpse into Tolkien's sub-creation. The Annotated Hobbit edited by Douglas A. Anderson (out of print, but soon to be reissued) gives details of composition and of changes between editions. Note: the edition &quot;illustrated by David Wenzel&quot; is a graphic-novel adaptation, not an illustrated edition nor an abridgment, as the cover and publisher's catalog imply.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Lord of the Rings\nSometimes published in 3 volumes: \n1. The Fellowship of the Ring\n2. The Two Towers \n3. The Return of the King \nTolkien's masterwork. A sequel to The Hobbit, but much richer and deeper (and longer) than its predecessor. Bilbo's heir Frodo embarks on an epic quest to destroy the sinister Ring acquired on the earlier journey. Often named the greatest novel of the 20th century.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Silmarillion\nBest seen as the lore book of the Elves whom the hobbits meet on their journeys. In a high formal tone, it tells of the mythic creation of the world and the tragic wars of the Elves and the Valar against evil. This volume was compiled after Tolkien's death as a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the latest versions of legends he'd been working on all his life.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFarmer Giles of Ham\nA short humorous account of an enterprising farmer in Anglo-Saxon times and his dealings with giants, dragons, knights, and other mythical beings. A hardcover edition includes introduction and annotations by Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull, plus a fragmentary sequel by the author. Without the extra material, the story is in the paperback omnibus The Tolkien Reader. Both editions in print have the splendid original illustrations by Pauline Baynes.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Children of HÃƒÂºrin\nMore recently, in 2007, the collection was completed with the publication of The Children of HÃƒÂºrin by HarperCollins (in the UK and Canada) and Houghton Mifflin (in the US). The novel tells the story of TÃƒÂºrin Turambar and his sister Nienor, children of HÃƒÂºrin Thalion. The material was compiled by Christopher Tolkien from The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, The History of Middle-earth, and unpublished manuscripts.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Legend of Sigurd and GudrÃƒÂºn\nIn February 2009, Publishers Weekly announced that Houghton Mifflin Harcourt had acquired the American rights to Tolkien's unpublished work The Legend of Sigurd and GudrÃƒÂºn.[153] The work, which was released worldwide on 5 May 2009 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and HarperCollins, retells the legend of Sigurd and the fall of the Niflungs from Germanic mythology. It is a narrative poem composed in alliterative verse and is modelled after the Old Norse poetry of the Elder Edda. Christopher Tolkien supplied copious notes and commentary upon his father's work.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRoverandom\nA children's novel not much shorter nor less elaborate than The Hobbit, but only published recently. Recounts the adventures of a wayward toy dog on the Moon and beneath the Sea. Includes introduction and annotations by Hammond and Scull.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHopefully you enjoy it, as I have the countless terabytes I have acquired through PirateBay over the years. Remember everybody, this site and others like it are a full circle, and only work with cooperation between all parties involved. So please for every 1GB of material downloaded try to at minimum give back (upload) 0.5GB back, because without someone seeding that latest episode of your favorite show last week, you wouldn't have it either. \n\n               *******LET US ALL GET SEEDY TO HELP THE NEEDY*******\n\nA Lokii_187 [MaSSaCRiSiS] Production","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6233295ab5b7510aaa524f4ab4caf58b26fb2240","amp;dn":"J.R.R+Tolkien+-+Complete+Ebook+Collection+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6233295ab5b7510aaa524f4ab4caf58b26fb2240","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,51,41,90,181,183,81,10,170,82,79,74,180,202,245,139,38,251,34,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
