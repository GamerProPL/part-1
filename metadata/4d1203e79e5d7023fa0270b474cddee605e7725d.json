Everything in the text is computable in this format and thereby invites readers to Ã¢â‚¬Å“experiment and learnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as they read. The book focuses on the core, fundamental principles of signal processing. The code corresponding to this book uses the core functionality of the scientific Python toolchain that should remain unchanged into the foreseeable future. For those looking to migrate their signal processing codes to Python, this book illustrates the key signal and plotting modules that can ease this transition. For those already comfortable with the scientific Python toolchain, this book illustrates the fundamental concepts in signal processing and provides a gateway to further signal processing concepts.\n\n\nFrom the Back Cover\n\nThis book covers the fundamental concepts in signal processing illustrated with Python code and made available via IPython Notebooks, which are live, interactive, browser-based documents that allow one to change parameters, redraw plots, and tinker with the ideas presented in the text.
