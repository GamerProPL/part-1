ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a tribute to my hero: Kurt Cobain and the amazing band Nirvana. This is the most complete collection out there and its a huge file so please seed for other fans. \n\nThis is a collection of music that I have either downloaded from many sources around the internet or have ripped myself. I would like to give credit to the original posters of the content I downloaded but I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have their names so IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m just gonna say thanks to all you Nirvana music uploaders out there for providing us entertainment. I have tried to assemble the highest quality audio for your listening pleasure.\n\n I wanted to release this on 4/5 to coincide with the anniversary Kurts death but the tagging, organizing and finding cover art took longer than expected.
