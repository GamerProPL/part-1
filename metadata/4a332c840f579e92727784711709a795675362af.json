It is heavily implied that Mikhael is a closeted transgender boy. This film follows his experiences with his newfound friends, his potential love interest, Lisa, his younger sister and his parents. It focuses in on the significance of gender identity in social interaction from an early age, the difficulties of being transgender and young, and how Mikhael navigates these in the background of childhood play and love.\n\nGenre: Drama\nIMDB rating: 7.4/10 from 1,947 users\nDirected by: CÃƒÂ©line Sciamma\nStarring: ZoÃƒÂ© HÃƒÂ©ran, Malonn LÃƒÂ©vana and Jeanne Disson\n\nRelease Name: Tomboy.2011.BDRip.XviD-FiCO\nSize: 735MB\nVideo: XviD | 624Ãƒâ€”336 | 1189 kbit/s\nAudio: French | MP3 | 128 kbit/s\nRuntime: 84 mins\nSubtitles: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a332c840f579e92727784711709a795675362af","amp;dn":"Tomboy.2011.BDRip.XviD-FiCO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a332c840f579e92727784711709a795675362af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,51,44,132,15,87,158,146,114,119,132,113,23,9,167,149,103,83,98,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
