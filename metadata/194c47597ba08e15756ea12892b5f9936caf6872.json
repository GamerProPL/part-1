As America faces a second economic depression, Klein's analysis of our corporate and branded world is as timely and powerful as ever.\n \n \nEqual parts cultural analysis, political manifesto, mall-rat memoir, and journalistic exposÃƒÂ©, No Logo is the first book to put the new resistance into pop-historical and clear economic perspective.  Naomi Klein tells a story of rebellion and self-determination in the face of our new branded world.\n \n \n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:194c47597ba08e15756ea12892b5f9936caf6872","amp;dn":"No+Logo+-+Naomi+Klein+%28epub%29+%5BQwerty80%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"194c47597ba08e15756ea12892b5f9936caf6872","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,76,71,89,123,160,142,21,117,110,161,40,146,181,249,147,108,175,104,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
