First the Almighty HE, the highest of all the gods, sends Jupiter, Horus, and ChÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ib-Yu off into an extremely arduous competition simply on account of some occasional drinking sprees! Then the three gods are subjected to scorn and derision: Q'nqura, the goddess of the Amazons, lets the trio win in battle out of pure spite, and then their humiliation is complete!\n\nThe Settlers III: Ultimate Collection is a lavishly designed, strategy-filled civilization simulation where your industrious people construct buildings, produce goods, harvest crops, and conquer new lands in scintillating real-time battles! Will you heed the call of the gods and become their avatar?\n\nWhat's cool about it\n\n Settlers III: Ultimate Collection includes the original The Settlers III, The Settlers III: Quest of the Amazons expansion, and The Settlers III Mission CD.\n\n Includes a full-featured and easy-to-use editor that gives you the power to create your own missions and maps.\n\n Two exciting campaigns per faction filled with challenging goals!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3044e8a8accf9160898a32e26b291061623317f9","amp;dn":"Settlers+III%3A+Ultimate+Collection+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3044e8a8accf9160898a32e26b291061623317f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,68,232,168,172,207,145,96,137,138,50,226,107,41,16,97,98,51,23,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
