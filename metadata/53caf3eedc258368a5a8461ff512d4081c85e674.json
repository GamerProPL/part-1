Even in cases where a hand-finished look is desired, ArtCAM accelerates production. \n\nUsing ArtCAM and a machine tool or router to machine most of the job leaves you more time to concentrate on the original design and the fine details, which together help to differentiate products in today's competitive markets.\n\n\n                      How to install ArtCAM 2011\n\n\n1) Run ArtCAM_2011_Setup.exe \n   Please UNCHECK &quot;Sentinel driver&quot; - from now you DON'T need this,\n   and install software.\n   During installation will be installed Delcam Exchange 2011.\n   Uninstall it - i'm added a newer version.\n\n2) Run ArtCAM_2011_HotfixIE.exe and install hotfix.\n\n3) Go to the &quot;Crack&quot; folder and copy ArtCAMPro.exe \n   for 32 bit - C:Program FilesArtCAM 2011Exec\n   for 64 bit - C:Program FilesArtCAM 2011Exec64\n   and overwrite the original files.\n\n   Also copy Wizards.exe and overwrite original file at \n   C:Program FilesArtCAM 2011ExecWizardsExec\n   for both, 32 and 64 bit versions\n\n4) By default ArtCAM run as Jewelsmith. \n   If you need Pro version Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in properties of shortcut \n   add text at the end of string Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“ /licence=pro.iniÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n                                                       \n   Or, copy file ArtCAMstarter.exe at same folder as ArtCAMPro.exe \n   and run ArtCAM from shortcut of ArtCAMstarter.exe .\n\n5) Also, if you need, you can install Delcam Exchange \n   and Delcam PostProcessor.
