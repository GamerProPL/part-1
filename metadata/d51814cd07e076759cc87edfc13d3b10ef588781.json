One day he was a doctor treating the dying, the next he was a patient struggling to live.\r\nWhen Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithiâ€™s transformation from a medical student asking what makes a virtuous and meaningful life into a neurosurgeon working in the core of human identity â€“ the brain â€“ and finally into a patient and a new father.\r\nWhat makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when when life is catastrophically interrupted? What does it mean to have a child as your own life fades away?\r\nPaul Kalanithi died while working on this profoundly moving book, yet his words live on as a guide to us all. When Breath Becomes Air is a life-affirming reflection on facing our mortality and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a gifted writer who became both.\r\n \nhttp://ultraimg.com/images/28670512.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d51814cd07e076759cc87edfc13d3b10ef588781","amp;dn":"When+Breath+Becomes+Air+by+Paul+Kalanithi+%28ePUB+%2B+MOBI%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d51814cd07e076759cc87edfc13d3b10ef588781","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,24,20,205,7,224,118,117,156,200,126,223,193,61,59,16,239,88,135,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
