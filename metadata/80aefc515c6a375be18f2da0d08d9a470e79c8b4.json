It collects eleven Top 40 hit singles, and five album tracks, including four new tracks, taken from Wonder's &quot;classic period&quot; running from 1972 to 1980. It peaked at #4 on the Billboard 200, at #1 on the Top R&amp;B Albums chart in the US, and went to #8 in the UK. It has been certified gold by the RIAA.\nCONTENT:\nEleven previously released tracks were taken as singles from their respective albums, with &quot;Higher Ground&quot; and &quot;Master Blaster (Jammin')&quot; released before the LP. &quot;Isn't She Lovely&quot; was not released as a single from Songs in the Key of Life, while &quot;Superstition&quot;, &quot;You Are the Sunshine of My Life&quot;, &quot;You Haven't Done Nothin'&quot;, &quot;I Wish&quot;, and &quot;Sir Duke&quot; all topped the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;Living for the City&quot; and &quot;Boogie On Reggae Woman&quot; appear in slightly different versions to those on their albums, and &quot;You Are the Sunshine of My Life&quot; is the single mix with the horns added.\n\nThe album also included four completely new songs, each tagged on as the last track on each album side: &quot;Front Line&quot;, &quot;Ribbon in the Sky&quot;, &quot;That Girl&quot;, and &quot;Do I Do&quot;. The latter track features a solo by bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80aefc515c6a375be18f2da0d08d9a470e79c8b4","amp;dn":"Stevie+Wonder+-+Original+Musiquarium+-+All+His+Great+Hits%282CD%29%5BF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80aefc515c6a375be18f2da0d08d9a470e79c8b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,174,252,81,92,106,55,91,225,143,45,160,208,141,154,71,14,121,200,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
