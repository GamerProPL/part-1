Take the role of gritty Police Chief Jack Boyd, and come face to face with the ugly underbelly of Freeburg, a city spiraling the drain. Will Jack reach his retirement with a nice stack of bills, or will he end up broken ... or worse?\r\n\r\nManage your staff, respond to emergencies, and investigate crimes in a city on the brink of chaos. The mafia underworld maneuvers behind the scenes, sinking their claws ever deeper into the city, even as the mayor is ready to exploit every situation to his political advantage. \r\nChoose your approach to each situation as it unfolds. Sometimes youâ€™ll be responding to a developing crisis at a crime scene, or negotiating with Freeburgâ€™s crime bosses. Sometimes youâ€™ll find yourself dodging questions in the press room, or even the occasional cross-examination in the witness box. Can you keep this pressure cooker from exploding, at least for long enough to stash away a nice retirement nest egg?\r\n\r\nYour mission is clear: make $500,000 in 180 days, before Jack Boyd reaches retirement. How? Thatâ€™s up to you!\r\nDecisions, decisions! This Is the Police is all about a dark story and how you react to it. Whatever you decide, your choices will influence the game â€“ and the fate of Jack Boyd.\r\nThe Good, the Bad, and... the Ugly? The Chief of Freeburg's Police Department deals with all kind of people. It is up to you to find the bad guys, and decide how to deal with them.\r\nCarry out your duties. As head of Freeburg PD, Jack deals with all sorts of challenges every day: responding to emergencies, managing his officers, defending the department against City Hall and a corrupt mayor, and much more.\r\nSolve Investigations and gather evidence against the criminal gangs of Freeburg.\r\nDeal with the competing powers of the city. Everyone offers you favors, and each one comes at a price.\r\nRich and fully voiced story: Jack Boyd is portrayed by Jon St. John, the voice of Duke Nukem.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10\r\nProcessor: Dual Core CPU\r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: Geforce 7800, AMD HD 4600, Intel HD3000 or similiar \r\nDirectX: Version 9.0 \r\nStorage: 5 GB available space \r\nSound Card: DirectX compatible\r\n\r\nRecommended system requirements - Windows: 10 \r\nProcessor: Quad Core CPU \r\nMemory: 4 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: GeForce 560 or higher, AMD Radeon HD 5800 or higher \r\nDirectX: Version 11 \r\nStorage: 5 GB available space \r\nSound Card: DirectX compatible","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1c54eba97e4cd310ea47fd379714ecf5d1251c1","amp;dn":"This+Is+the+Police+%28v2.5.0.12%29+%5BGOG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1c54eba97e4cd310ea47fd379714ecf5d1251c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,197,78,186,151,228,205,49,14,164,127,211,121,113,78,207,93,18,81,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
