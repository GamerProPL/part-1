Artificially-intelligent robots. Self-driving cars. Neuro-technological brain enhancements. Genetic editing. The evidence of dramatic change is all around us and it's happening at exponential speed. Professor Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum, has been at the centre of global affairs for over four decades. He is convinced that the period of change we are living through is more significant, and the ramifications of the latest technological revolution more profound than any prior period of human history. He has dubbed this era the fourth industrial revolution. Crowdsourcing ideas, insights and wisdom from the World Economic Forum's global network of business, government, civil society and youth leaders, this book looks deeply at the future that is unfolding today and how we might take collective responsibility to ensure it is a positive one for all of us","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44c7a70b82ca460851779d8531d9dbd5b4bc8a23","amp;dn":"The+Fourth+Industrial+Revolution+%282016%29+%28Pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44c7a70b82ca460851779d8531d9dbd5b4bc8a23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,199,167,11,130,202,70,8,81,119,157,133,49,217,219,213,180,188,138,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
