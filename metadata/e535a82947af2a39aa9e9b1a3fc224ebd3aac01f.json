Adapting the novel Live Flesh by British mystery author Ruth Rendell, AlmodÃƒÂ³var has given the material a Spanish makeover with added political thrust. Beginning in 1970 in Franco&amp;#039;s Madrid, when a prostitute (Penelope Cruz) gives birth to a son, Victor, the story leaps forward to contemporary Madrid. Wealthy diplomat&amp;#039;s daughter Elena (Francesca Neri) is watching Luis BuÃƒÂ±uel&amp;#039;s The Criminal Life of Archibaldo de La Cruz (1955) while waiting for the arrival of her heroin dealer, and she accidentally buzzes pizza delivery man Victor (Liberto Rabal) into the building. In the confusion that follows, two cops, David (Javier Bardem) and Sancho (Jose Sancho) arrive, and a gun goes off. The story then makes another leap to four years later: Victor is in prison, while Elena, no longer on drugs, runs a disadvantaged children&amp;#039;s shelter and is married to wheelchair-bound David. After his release, Victor visits his mother&amp;#039;s grave and spots David and Elena at the cemetery -- where David meets philandering wife Clara (Angela Molina). Fate interweaves the tangled interrelationships of all into a complex tapestry of destiny and guilt. Shown at 1997 London and New York film festivals.\nBhob Stewart\n\nReview from AMG\n\nThe second film in the &quot;mature phase&quot; of Pedro Almodovar&amp;#039;s career, which began with La Flor de Mi Secreto two years earlier, Carne Tremula borrows chunks of its ornate plot from Ruth Rendell&amp;#039;s novel Live Flesh. The film&amp;#039;s political subtext and messy humanity, however, bear the distinctive stamp of its celebrated director. A deeply felt exploration of the tension between destiny and chance, human will and involuntary longing, Carne Tremula plays a delicate juggling act with competing subplots that slowly reveal their intimate connections. Unlike Paul Thomas Anderson&amp;#039;s similarly themed but deeply flawed Magnolia, Almodovar&amp;#039;s film zeroes in on its ideas subtly and precisely. The closest the director gets to his well-known affinity for garish excess and picturesque debilities is a few minutes of the haunted, haunting Francesca Neri in a fright wig, and several straight-faced scenes of stand-up guy Javier Bardem playing wheelchair basketball. Elsewhere, it&amp;#039;s all tightly coiled passion and darkly libidinous will-to-power -- an urgent directive to get on with life. American audiences might not grasp all the levels of Almodovar&amp;#039;s allegory about the legacy of Franco&amp;#039;s reign, but most everyone should recognize the contrary passions that propel his characters to desperate acts and unlikely redemptions. Flawlessly acted by Bardem, Neri, Liberto Rabal, and Angela Molina, Carne Tremula offers a darker counterpoint to the tragicomic shadings of 1999&amp;#039;s Todo Sobre Mi Madre.\nBrian J.
