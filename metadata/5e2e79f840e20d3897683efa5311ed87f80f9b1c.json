And now, in an updated compact size, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no job site this book canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t handle.\nWhat do you do when things break? If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re like most people, you have two options: call a repairman or pay for costly replacements. But if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever wished for a third choice, this is your book: a one-volume encyclopedia of do-it-yourself fixes that will save you money, time, and frustration as you become your own home handy-person.\n\nThe first three editions of The Complete Photo Guide to Home Repair sold more than 600,000 copies. At a price of $35, the 560-page hardcover version was a lot of book for the money. But for some, it was just too big to manage on the jobÃ¢â‚¬â€so we shrunk it. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve kept all the information and all the beautiful full-color photos, but adapted them to a 6.5-by-8.5-inch compact edition that can fit in most toolboxes and live happily on your favorite bookshelf. Initially, the compact edition was available only at large home centers, where it grew so popular that now, for the first time ever, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve decided to make it available to everyone at a reduced bargain price of $00.00 (LOL). Plumbing, wiring, windows and doors, flooring, furnaces, water heaters, wall coverings . . . if it can be found in or around your house, The Complete Photo Guide to Home Repair will teach you how to fix it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e2e79f840e20d3897683efa5311ed87f80f9b1c","amp;dn":"Black+%26amp%3B+Decker+The+Book+of+Home+How-To+-+The+Complete+Photo+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e2e79f840e20d3897683efa5311ed87f80f9b1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,46,121,248,64,226,13,56,151,104,62,250,83,17,237,135,248,15,155,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
