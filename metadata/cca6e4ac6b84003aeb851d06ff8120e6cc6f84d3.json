How the World Works\n\n\nAuthors...: Noam Chomsky, Arthur Naiman, and David Barsamian\nTitle.....: How the World Works (Real Story)\nPaperback.: 336 pages\nPublisher.: Soft Skull Press (September 20, 2011)\nLanguage..: English\nISBN-10...: 1593764278\nISBN-13...: 978-1593764272 \nFormats...: epub, mobi, and PDF (the latter is my conversion from the epub). \nTotal size: 4.03 MB\nInfo hash.: CCA6E4AC 6B84003A EB851D06 FF8120E6 CC6F84D3 \n \nAccording to The New York Times, Noam Chomsky is arguably the most important intellectual alive. But he isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t easy to read . . . or at least he wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t until these books came along. Made up of intensively edited speeches and interviews, they offer something not found anywhere else: pure Chomsky, with every dazzling idea and penetrating insight intact, delivered in clear, accessible, reader-friendly prose.\n\nPublished as four short books in the famous Real Story seriesÃ¢â‚¬â€What Uncle Sam Really Wants; The Prosperous Few and the Restless Many; Secrets, Lies and Democracy; and The Common GoodÃ¢â‚¬â€theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve collectively sold almost 600,000 copies.\n\nAnd they continue to sell year after year after year because ChomskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ideas become, if anything, more relevant as time goes by. For example, twenty years ago he pointed out that in 1970, about 90% of international capital was used for trade and long-term investmentÃ¢â‚¬â€more or less productive thingsÃ¢â‚¬â€and 10% for speculation. By 1990, those figures had reversed. As we know, speculation continued to increase exponentially. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re paying the price now for not heeding him them.\n \n\n.................................................\n\n\nMy upload blog at the forum: &lt;a href=&quot; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=31015&amp;page=18&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=31015&amp;page=18&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cca6e4ac6b84003aeb851d06ff8120e6cc6f84d3","amp;dn":"Noam+Chomsky+et+al.+%282011%29.+How+the+World+Works","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cca6e4ac6b84003aeb851d06ff8120e6cc6f84d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,166,228,172,107,132,0,58,235,133,29,6,255,129,32,230,204,111,132,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
