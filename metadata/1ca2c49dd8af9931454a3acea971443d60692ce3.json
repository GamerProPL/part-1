Ram Jam's only hit, &quot;Black Betty,&quot; created quite a stir when Epic Records released it. The recording session was the brainstorm of Barlett and bubblegum producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz. Two civil rights groups, the N.A.A.C.P. and C.O.R.E., called for a boycott of the song, claiming it insulted black women. Despite the controversy, it still reached the number 18 spot on Billboard's pop chart in September 1977. The Cincinnati band Starstruck had released a more driving, riveting version of &quot;Black Betty&quot; on the Truckstar label before Ram Jam's version. Starstruck's version received little airplay or recognition; ironically, future Ram Jam member Barlett had been a member of Starstruck when they recorded &quot;Black Betty.&quot; \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Black Betty\n02.Let It All Out\n03.Keep Your Hands On The Wheel\n04.Right On The Money\n05.All For The Love Of Rock 'N' Roll\n06.404\n07.High Steppin'\n08.Overloaded\n09.Hey Boogie Woman\n10.Too Bad On Your Birthday\n11.The Kid Next Door\n12.Turnpike\n13.Wanna Find Love\n14.Just Like Me\n15.Hurricane Ride\n16.Saturday Night\n17.Runway Runaway\n18.Please, Please, Please (Please Me)\n19.Gone Wild\n20.Pretty Poison\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ca2c49dd8af9931454a3acea971443d60692ce3","amp;dn":"Ram+Jam+-+The+Very+Best+Of+%281995%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ca2c49dd8af9931454a3acea971443d60692ce3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,162,196,157,216,175,153,49,69,74,58,206,169,113,68,61,96,105,44,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
