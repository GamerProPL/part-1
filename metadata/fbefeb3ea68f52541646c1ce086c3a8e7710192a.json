The band members, Pertti,\nKari, Toni and Sami, are mentally handicapped and they play their\nmusic with a lot of attitude and pride.\n\nWe follow these professional musicians on their journey from\nobscurity to popularity. We watch them fight, fall in love and\nexperience strong emotions. We witness long days in the recording\nstudio and on tour. They laugh, cry, drink and fight over who gets\nto sit in the front on the tour bus. Then it's time to make up and\ngo talk to people in the audience and tell them how great their\nband is.\n\nTheir songs are about the problems in society as well as about\nthings that they face in their everyday life: how going to the\npedicurist sucks and the misery of living in a group home. The\nguys give piece of their mind to both politicians and people\nwhose attitudes towards people with intellectual disabilities\nneed improvement.\n\nThe Punk Syndrome is a film about the essence of punk. Its a\nstory of handicapped people rebelling against the mainstream.\nThis time you're allowed to stare and wonder why they act the way\nthey do. And you'll fall in love with them as you watch how the\nmost kick-ass punk band in Finland conquers the world.\n\nOriginal title: Kovasikajuttu","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbefeb3ea68f52541646c1ce086c3a8e7710192a","amp;dn":"The.Punk.Syndrome.2012.DOCU.DVDRiP.XViD-FiRMAN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbefeb3ea68f52541646c1ce086c3a8e7710192a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,239,235,62,166,143,82,84,22,70,193,206,8,108,58,142,119,16,25,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
