Based on a short story written by lead singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala and sound manipulation artist Jeremy Michael Ward, the album is an hour-long tale of Cerpin Taxt, a man who tries to kill himself by overdosing on a mixture of morphine and rat poison. The attempt lands him in a week-long coma during which he experiences visions of humanity and his own psyche. Upon waking, he is dissatisfied with the real world and jumps to his death. The story of Cerpin Taxt is based on the death of El Paso, Texas artist - and Bixler-Zavala's friend - Julio Venegas.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee6084b204f774e2faf0fff2d695979d89e9e587","amp;dn":"The+Mars+Volta+-+De-loused+in+the+Comatorium","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee6084b204f774e2faf0fff2d695979d89e9e587","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,96,132,178,4,247,116,226,250,240,255,242,214,149,151,157,137,233,229,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
