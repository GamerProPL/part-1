He is most famous for his 1971 songs American Pie and Vincent.\n\nDon McLean was profoundly affected by the deaths of both Buddy Holly and John F. Kennedy. In his personal life, he endured the death of his father in 1961. McLean graduated from Iona Preparatory School in 1963 but dropped out of Villanova University before getting a degree. He later attended night school at Iona College and received a Bachelors degree in Business Administration in 1968.\n\nHe was a popular folk singer at campus events. With the help of a grant from the New York State Council on the Arts, he began reaching a wider public, with visits to towns up and down the Hudson River. He learned the art of performing from his friend and mentor Pete Seeger. McLean accompanied Seeger on his Clearwater boat up the Hudson River in 1969 to protest environmental pollution in the river. The Clearwater campaign was widely credited for improving water quality in the Hudson River.\n\nTitles on disc 1\n1.: American Pie\n2.: Castles In The Air\n3.: Dreidel\n4.: Winterwood\n5.: Everyday\n6.: Sister Fatima\n7.: Empty Chairs\n8.: Birthday Song\n9.: Wonderful Baby\n10.: La La I Love You\n11.: Vincent\n12.: Crossroads\n13.: And I Love You So\n14.: Fool&amp;#039;s Paradise\n15.: If We Try\n16.: Mountains Of Mourne\n17.: Grave\n18.: Respectable\n19.: Going For The Gold\n20.: Crying\n\nGenre: Rock &amp; Pop\nRelease Date: 03/04/2000\nLabel / Distributor: Liberty / EMI\nStudio / Live: Studio\n\nEnjoy! and please seed..\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a2bdc5df442f34d9ac8b46ca3d844c25b74422a","amp;dn":"Don+McLean+American+Pie+%28Greatest+Hits%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a2bdc5df442f34d9ac8b46ca3d844c25b74422a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,43,220,93,244,66,243,77,154,200,180,108,163,216,68,194,91,116,66,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
