That was also around the time he and his friends, already fans of Flying Lotus, discovered Low End Theory. Shlohmo has rocketed onto our radar screen in recent months with his lo-fi, psychedelic mix of abstract hip-hop, bouncy synth-funk, breezy trip-hop, and what sounds like lost MoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Wax gems from an alternate future.\n\nHis tracks swarm from dirty textures, strange sounds and obscured samples. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not hip-hop what you hear, but the echoes are clearly there.\n\nFrom http://www.last.fm/music/Shlohmo/+wiki\n\n-------------\n\nCamping EP [2010]\n\n1. Naps\n2. Birthday Beat\n3.
