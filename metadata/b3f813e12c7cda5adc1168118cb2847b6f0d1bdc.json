Concepts are smoothly introduced while thoroughly described with a great number of examples and figures. The author willfully takes the side of focusing on basic and short examples highlighting the features being described instead of long and wearing examples.\r\n\r\nTrickier and essential points are not fully conveyed in a single â€œdoseâ€ as it is generally done. Instead, they are described with different perspectives in different sections, each time adding new pieces of information in order to tame them step-by-step efficiently.\r\n\r\nThe book details the most important features of the C language and C libraries as specified by the standards C90 and C99. A dedicated chapter introducing C11 gives the most useful new features that can be exploited by beginners and intermediate programmers in C.\r\n\r\nC Programming: The Tutorial not only does it set the learning up a sound basis but goes beyond the description of the C language. If, in the first part of the book, it describes the C language, it provides valuable material in the last three chapters in which it explains, in Linux and UNIX systems, how to compile C program with gcc, manage compilations with make, improve programs with additional tools such as GDB, cope with the versions of programs with SCCS and RCS.\r\n\r\nC Programming: The Tutorial by Thomas Gabriel\r\nEnglish | 24 Aug 2016 | ASIN: B01L0EMXIG | 1341 Pages | PDF | 25.28 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3f813e12c7cda5adc1168118cb2847b6f0d1bdc","amp;dn":"C+Programming%3A+The+Tutorial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3f813e12c7cda5adc1168118cb2847b6f0d1bdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,248,19,225,44,124,218,90,220,17,104,17,140,178,132,123,111,13,27,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
