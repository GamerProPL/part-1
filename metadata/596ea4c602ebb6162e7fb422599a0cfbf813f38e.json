Growing up in the Deep South, where she was Ã¢â‚¬Å“home-schooled for hippie reasons,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she looked online to find her tribe. The internet was in its infancy and she became an early adopter at every stage of its growthÃ¢â‚¬â€finding joy and unlikely friendships in the emerging digital world. Her relative isolation meant that she could pursue passions like gaming, calculus, and 1930Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s detective novels without shame. Because she had no idea how Ã¢â‚¬Å“uncoolÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ she really was.\n\nBut if it hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been for her strange backgroundÃ¢â‚¬â€the awkwardness continued when she started college at sixteen, with Mom driving her to campus every dayÃ¢â‚¬â€she might never have had the naive confidence to forge her own path. Like when she graduated as valedictorian with a math degree and then headed to Hollywood to pursue a career in acting despite having zero contacts. Or when she tired of being typecast as the crazy cat-lady secretary and decided to create her own web series before people in show business understood that online video could be more than just cats chasing laser pointers.\n\nFeliciaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rags-to-riches rise to internet fame launched her career as one of the most influential creators in new media. Now FeliciaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world is filled with creativity, video games, and a dash of feminist activismÃ¢â‚¬â€just like her memoir.\n\nShowcasing FeliciaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hilarious and unique voice, YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Never Weird on the Internet (Almost) is proof that everyone should celebrate what makes them different and be brave enough to share it with the world, because anything is possible nowÃ¢â‚¬â€even for a digital misfit.\n\n\nRead by Felicia Day\nFormat: MP3\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:596ea4c602ebb6162e7fb422599a0cfbf813f38e","amp;dn":"Felicia+Day+-+You%27re+Never+Weird+on+the+Internet+%28Almost%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"596ea4c602ebb6162e7fb422599a0cfbf813f38e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,110,164,198,2,235,182,22,46,127,180,34,89,154,12,251,248,19,243,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
