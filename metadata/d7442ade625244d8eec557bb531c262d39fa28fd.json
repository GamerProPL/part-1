Good thing heÃ¢Â€â„¢s also brilliant, rich, and (some people might say) handsome, or heÃ¢Â€â„¢d probably be homeless. Riley Moon has just graduated from Harvard Business and Harvard Law. Her aggressive Texas spitfire attitude has helped her land her dream job as a junior analyst with mega-bank Blane-Grunwald. At least Riley Moon thought it was her dream job, until she is given her first assignment: babysitting Emerson Knight.\r\n\r\nWhat starts off as an inquiry about missing bank funds in the Knight account leads to inquiries about a missing man, missing gold, and a life-and-death race across the country. Through the streets of Washington, D.C., and down into the underground vault of the Federal Reserve in New York City, an evil plan is exposed. A plan so sinister that only a megalomaniac could think it up, and only the unlikely duo of the irrepressibly charming Emerson Knight and the tenacious Riley Moon can stop it.\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/shtihl22\r\n\r\n=======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7442ade625244d8eec557bb531c262d39fa28fd","amp;dn":"Curious+Minds+%28Knight+and+Moon+1%29+by+Janet+Evanovich+%282016%29+-+ep","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7442ade625244d8eec557bb531c262d39fa28fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,68,42,222,98,82,68,216,238,197,87,187,83,28,38,45,57,250,40,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
