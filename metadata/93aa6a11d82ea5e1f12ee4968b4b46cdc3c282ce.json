This instant classic is the story of an intransigent young architect, his violent battle against conventional standards, and his explosive love affair with a beautiful woman who struggles to defeat him. This edition contains a special afterword by RandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s literary executor, Leonard Peikoff, which includes excerpts from Ayn RandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own notes on the making of The Fountainhead. As fresh today as it was then, here is a novel about a heroÃ¢â‚¬â€and about those who try to destroy him.\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93aa6a11d82ea5e1f12ee4968b4b46cdc3c282ce","amp;dn":"The+Fountainhead+by+Ayn+Rand+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93aa6a11d82ea5e1f12ee4968b4b46cdc3c282ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,170,106,17,216,46,165,225,241,46,228,150,139,75,70,205,195,194,130,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
