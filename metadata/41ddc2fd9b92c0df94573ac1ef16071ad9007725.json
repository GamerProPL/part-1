Though originally released in short sections, I have seamlessly integrated the sections for each series into single MP4 files for convenience, since each webisode in a series continues directly from the prior webisode.\n\nThe first file is Torn Apart, featuring the webisodes released after the first season of The Walking Dead. This side-story ties in with the main story by showing the events leading up to the transformation of one of the more notable walkers Rick encounters in the first episode of season one, Days Gone Bye.\n\nThe second file is Cold Storage, featuring the webisodes released after the second season of The Walking Dead. This side-story also ties in with the main story of The Walking Dead, but I will leave it up to you to discover how.\n\nFinally, the third file is The Oath, featuring the webisodes released after the third season of The Walking Dead. The most familiar feature is an abandoned, pale green Hyundai Tuscan. Hm, I wonder what that is doing thereÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nRuntimes and Disk Space:\n\nTorn Apart runs for about 17 minutes and is 180 MB in size; Cold Storage runs for about 24 minutes and is 250 MB in size; and The Oath runs for about 25 minutes and is 550 MB in size. The files will play on PS3 and in VLC Media Player. Total disk space is just under 1 GB.\n\nIf you appreciate this torrent, please consider keeping it in your library and seeding it back to the community a few times over Ã¢â‚¬â€ help each other out. This file is just under 1 GB, so it does not take up much space on your hard drive. Whilst I will keep this torrent in my library and seed whenever possible, as a general rule, when there's 50 or more seeds, I will seed to a ratio of 2.0; when there's only around 20 seeds, I will seed to a ratio of 3 or 4; less than 10 seeds, I will seed indefinitely unless a torrent of similar quality rises in popularity and makes the current torrent redundant. These seed ratios are also increased when the number of peers exceeds 10.\n\nThank you for your time, and I hope you enjoy this torrent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41ddc2fd9b92c0df94573ac1ef16071ad9007725","amp;dn":"The+Walking+Dead+Webisodes+-+Series+1+%28Torn+Apart%29%2C+2+%28Cold+Stor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41ddc2fd9b92c0df94573ac1ef16071ad9007725","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,221,194,253,155,146,192,223,148,87,58,193,239,22,7,26,217,0,119,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
