Hopper stars as the \n\neponymous American, currently a middleman selling the work of American painter Derwatt (Nicholas Ray), who has feigned \n\nhis own death to increase the value of his paintings. While auctioning this work in Berlin, he meets art restorer Jonathan \n\nZimmerman (Bruno Ganz), who he learns is suffering from an incurable blood disease. When a shady friend (Gerard Blain) \n\nrequires Ripley to find a &quot;clean&quot; non-professional to do a contract hit in order to pay off a debt, even he is reluctant. But he \n\nquickly realizes that the physically vulnerable Jonathan would be perfect for the job, and tries to get him to accept by \n\nemploying various subterfuges to persuade him that his condition is even worse than it is. For his part, Blain guarantees the \n\nrestorer that his family will be financially secure for life, and a deal is struck. As usual, nothing works out quite as expected.\n\nIMDB: tt0075675\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Der.Amerikanische.Freund.(1978).DVDRip.XviD.AC3.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.46 GiB\n      PlayTime : 2h 30s\n      Bit rate : 1727 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 11.1 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 2h 30s\n      Bit rate : 1274 Kbps\n      Width : 672 pixels\n      Height : 368 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 16/9\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.205\n      StreamSize : 1.07 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 2h 30s\n      Bit rate : 446 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 6 channels\n      Channel positions : Front: L C R, Rear: L R, Subwoofer\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 385 MiB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1192924cbbcc76b79a60f815186aba0ccef3b81c","amp;dn":"The+American+Friend+-+Wim+Wenders+%5B1977%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1192924cbbcc76b79a60f815186aba0ccef3b81c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,146,146,76,187,204,118,183,154,96,248,21,24,106,186,12,206,243,184,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
