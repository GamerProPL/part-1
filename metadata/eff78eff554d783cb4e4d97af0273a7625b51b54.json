The features available in VMwareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vSphere 5.x suite of products simplify the management of resources, increase the availability of applications, and guarantee the performance of workloads deployed in the virtualized datacenters. &quot;VMware vSphere 5.x Design Cookbook&quot; covers the design process from creating the conceptual design, to determining the resource requirements for the logical design, and then on to creating the physical design.\n\n&quot;VMware vSphere 5.x Datacenter Design Cookbook&quot; begins with the process of identifying the design factors and applying them to the logical and physical design process in order to create a successful vSphere 5.x design. The key to a successful VMware vSphere 5.x design is the designÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to satisfy the design factors. This Cookbook walks you through the process of identifying the design factors which include the requirements the design must satisfy and the assumptions the architect makes to form the conceptual design.\n\nFrom the conceptual design, the logical design is created. The logical design process includes determining the architecture of and the resources required for the management, storage, network, and compute resources. This Cookbook includes recipes for calculating the resources required and determining the architecture and features to use while applying VMware recommended practices.\n\nThe physical design takes the logical design requirements and maps them to the physical infrastructure required to support the resources. &quot;VMware vSphere 5.x Datacenter Design Cookbook&quot; offers recipes to determine the physical resources and configuration required to support the logical design while satisfying the design factors. Finally, the book provides recipes for creating design documentation. Documenting the design, the implementation procedures, and the verification procedures are also covered towards the end of the book.\nApproach\n\nA practical guide packed with step-by-step recipes to design a virtual datacenter using VMware 5.x\nWho this book is for\n\nThis book is a guide for anyone interested in designing virtualized datacenters using VMware vSphere 5.x and the supporting components. Current administrators of VMware vSphere environments will find this book useful when interested in becoming a vSphere Architect or are interested in learning more about the virtual datacenter design process. Knowledge of vSphere installation, configuration, and administration is a prerequisite.\nAbout the Author\nHersey Cartwright\n\nHersey Cartwright has worked in the technology industry since 1996 in many roles from help desk support to IT management. He first started working with VMware technologies in 2006. He was the key sponsor of the virtualization initiative at ABNB Federal Credit Union and played a key role in the design, implementation, and management of ABNB's virtual infrastructure.\nIn his current role as the Senior Virtualization Engineer at ABS Technology Architects, he is responsible for the design and implementation of VMware environments, supporting a wide range of business applications. Most of the work he does is with small and medium environments with 3-10 hosts, but he has also been involved with several large multi-site deployments. He has experience with a wide variety of server and storage platforms.\nSince January 2011, he has been an instructor with the VMware IT Academy at Tidewater Community College where he teaches the VMware Install, Configure, and Manage vSphere 5 and the Optimize and Scale vSphere 5 courses. He has designed and implemented the lab environment used by students in the virtualization and security programs offered at the Chesapeake Campus of Tidewater Community College. He enjoys teaching and learns a lot from teaching others about the benefits of virtualization.\nAlong with VMware certifications, he also holds certifications from Citrix for XenApp and XenDesktop and the Information Storage Associate (EMCISA) certification from EMC.\nHe actively participates in the VMware community and has been awarded the vExpert title in both 2013 and 2012. He has presented multiple ProfessionalVMware.com vBrownBags on vSphere administration, vSphere design, and vSphere disaster recovery. He regularly blogs about virtualization and other technologies at http://www.vhersey.com/. \n\nPublisher: Packt Publishing (24 January 2014)\nSold by: Amazon Digital Services, Inc.\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B00I2ORN8S","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eff78eff554d783cb4e4d97af0273a7625b51b54","amp;dn":"%5BHersey+Cartwright%5DVMware+vSphere+5.x+Datacenter+Design+Cookbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eff78eff554d783cb4e4d97af0273a7625b51b54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,247,142,255,85,77,120,60,180,228,217,122,240,39,58,118,37,181,27,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
