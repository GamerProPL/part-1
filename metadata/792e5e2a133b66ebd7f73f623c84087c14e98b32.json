Among the amazing finds he uncovers are marine creatures with five eyes and a proboscis; filter-feeders shaped like tulips; worm-like scavengers covered in spikes but with no identifiable head or anus; and a metre-long predator resembling a giant shrimp.\r\n\r\n2)  Feathered Dinosaurs \r\nFortey travels to north eastern China to see a fossil site known as the 'Dinosaur Pompeii' - a place that has yielded spectacular remains of feathered dinosaurs and rewritten the story of the origins of birds. Among the amazing finds he investigates are the feathered cousin of T-rex, a feathered dinosaur with strong parallels to living pandas, and some of the most remarkable flying animals that have ever lived.\r\n\r\n3)  The Mammal Hothouse \r\nFortey investigates the remains of ancient volcanic lake in Germany where stunningly well-preserved fossils of early mammals, giant insects and even perhaps our oldest known ancestor have been found. Among the amazing finds are bats as advanced and sophisticated as anything living today, more than 50-million-years-later, dog-sized 'Dawn' horses, the ancestor of the modern horse and giant ants as large as a hummingbird.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a3/Fossil-Wonderlands-Nature-s-Hidden-Treasures-BBC-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6e/Fossil-Wonderlands-Nature-s-Hidden-Treasures-BBC-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/88/Fossil-Wonderlands-Nature-s-Hidden-Treasures-BBC-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7b/Fossil-Wonderlands-Nature-s-Hidden-Treasures-BBC-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8a/Fossil-Wonderlands-Nature-s-Hidden-Treasures-BBC-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/49/Fossil-Wonderlands-Nature-s-Hidden-Treasures-BBC-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/eb/Fossil-Wonderlands-Nature-s-Hidden-Treasures-BBC-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/23/Fossil-Wonderlands-Nature-s-Hidden-Treasures-BBC-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/07/Fossil-Wonderlands-Nature-s-Hidden-Treasures-BBC-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 22 (~3983Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 3\r\n * Part Size: 1.69 GB (average)\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03y6tg6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:792e5e2a133b66ebd7f73f623c84087c14e98b32","amp;dn":"BBC+Fossil+Wonderlands+Natures+Hidden+Treasures+1of3+Weird+Wonde","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"792e5e2a133b66ebd7f73f623c84087c14e98b32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,46,94,42,19,59,102,235,215,247,63,98,60,132,8,124,20,233,139,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
