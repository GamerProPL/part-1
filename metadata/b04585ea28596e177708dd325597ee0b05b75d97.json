Many people feel guilty after spending hours watching cat videos or clicking link after link after link. But Goldsmith sees that â€œwastedâ€ time differently. Unlike old media, the internet demands active engagementâ€”and itÃ¢Â€â„¢s actually making us more social, more creative, even more productive.\r\n\r\nWhen Goldsmith, a renowned conceptual artist and poet, introduced a class at the University of Pennsylvania called â€œWasting Time on the Internetâ€, he nearly broke the internet. The New Yorker, the Atlantic, the Washington Post, Slate, Vice, Time, CNN, the Telegraph, and many more, ran articles expressing their shock, dismay, and, ultimately, their curiosity. GoldsmithÃ¢Â€â„¢s ideas struck a nerve, because they are brilliantly subversiveâ€”and endlessly shareable.\r\n\r\nIn Wasting Time on the Internet, Goldsmith expands upon his provocative insights, contending that our digital lives are remaking human experience. When weÃ¢Â€â„¢re â€œwasting time,â€ weÃ¢Â€â„¢re actually creating a culture of collaboration. WeÃ¢Â€â„¢re reading and writing moreâ€”and quite differently. And weÃ¢Â€â„¢re turning concepts of authority and authenticity upside-down. The internet puts us in a state between deep focus and subconscious flow, a state that Goldsmith argues is ideal for creativity. Where that creativity takes us will be one of the stories of the twenty-first century.\r\n\r\nWide-ranging, counterintuitive, engrossing, unpredictableâ€”like the internet itselfâ€”Wasting Time on the Internet is the manifesto you didnÃ¢Â€â„¢t know you needed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b04585ea28596e177708dd325597ee0b05b75d97","amp;dn":"Wasting+Time+on+the+Internet+by+Kenneth+Goldsmith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b04585ea28596e177708dd325597ee0b05b75d97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,69,133,234,40,89,110,23,119,8,221,50,85,151,238,11,5,183,93,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
