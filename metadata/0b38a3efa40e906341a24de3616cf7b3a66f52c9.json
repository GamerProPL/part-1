The Lord Ruler Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the man who claimed to be god incarnate and brutally ruled the world for a thousand years Ã¢â‚¬â€œ has been vanquished. But Kelsier, the hero who masterminded that triumph, is dead too, and now the awesome task of building a new world has been left to his young protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©, Vin, the former street urchin who is now the most powerful Mistborn in the land, and to the idealistic young nobleman she loves.\n\nAs KelsierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ© and slayer of the Lord Ruler she is now venerated by a budding new religion, a distinction that makes her intensely uncomfortable. Even more worrying, the mists have begun behaving strangely since the Lord Ruler died, and seem to harbor a strange vaporous entity that haunts her.\n\nStopping assassins may keep VinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mistborn skills sharp, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the least of her problems. Luthadel, the largest city of the former empire, doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t run itself, and Vin and the other members of KelsierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crew, who lead the revolution, must learn a whole new set of practical and political skills to help. It certainly wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get easier with three armies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one of them composed of ferocious giants Ã¢â‚¬â€œ now vying to conquer the city, and no sign of the Lord RulerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hidden cache of atium, the rarest and most powerful allomantic metal.\n\nAs the siege of Luthadel tightens, an ancient legend seems to offer a glimmer of hope. But even if it really exists, no one knows where to find the Well of Ascension or what manner of power it bestows.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b38a3efa40e906341a24de3616cf7b3a66f52c9","amp;dn":"The+Well+of+Ascension%3A+Mistborn%2C+Book+2+%28Audiobook%29+%5BChapterized","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b38a3efa40e906341a24de3616cf7b3a66f52c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,56,163,239,164,14,144,99,65,162,77,227,97,108,247,179,166,111,82,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
