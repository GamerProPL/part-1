Known for their distinctive vocal harmony style, they became one of the leadinggroups of the era. They enjoyed considerable popularity in many countries, although they did not achieve major US chart success until 1966. Along with The Rolling Stones and The Searchers, they are one of the fewpop groups of the early 1960s that have never officially broken up and that continue to record and perform. The Hollies were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nFormed: 1962 Manchester, England\n\nMembers:\n\nTony Hicks\nBobby Elliott\nRay Stiles\nSteve Lauri\nIan Parker\nPeter Howarth\n\nPast Members:\n\nGraham Nash\nAllan Clarke\nDenis Haines\nTerry Sylvester\nEric Haydock\nAllen Coates\nVic Steele\nDon Rathbone\nBernie Calvert\nMikael Rickfors\nCarl Wayne\n\nOne of the best and most commercially successful pop/rock acts of theInvasion, when the Hollies began recording in 1963, they relied heavily upon the R&amp;B/early rock &amp; roll covers that provided the staple diet for countlessbands of the time. They quickly developed a more distinctive style of three-part harmonies (heavily influenced by the Everly Brothers), ringing guitars, and hook-happy material, penned by both outside writers (especially Graham Gouldman) and themselves, eventually composing most of their repertoire on their own. The best early Hollies records evoke an infectious, melodic cheer similar to that of the early Beatles, although the Hollies were neither their class (not an insult: nobody else was) nor demonstrated a similar capacity for artistic growth. They tried, though, easing into somewhat more sophisticated folk-rock and mildly psychedelic sounds as the decade wore on, especially on their albums (which contain quite a few overlooked highlights). \n\nCD 1\n\n1.

Even the sleeve notes dispense with the scantest of biographical detail to present a veritable almanac of impressive global chart statistics, including mentions of #1 singles in Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Holland, South Africa, Singapore, Ireland, and Switzerland, as well as the UK. Of course, the Hollies were nothing if not adaptable. The grinning beat pop and &quot;pap pap she waddy wops&quot; of &quot;Stay&quot; through to the folky overtures of &quot;I've Got a Way of My Own&quot; (like an estrogen-free version of the Mamas and the Papas) were obviously marvelous and yet entirely generic responses to the overriding cultural dominance of the Beatles and Bob Dylan. But much the same thing can be said for the majority of their peers.\n\nStill, the 1960s were a golden age for the Hollies and to hear the Graham Gouldman-penned &quot;Bus Stop&quot;, &quot;Carrie Anne&quot; (part Kinks, part Beach Boys, part calypso), or the sweet-shop bubblegum of &quot;Jennifer Eccles&quot; is to be reacquainted with a sunny lost world of short skirts, Mini Coopers, and policemen on bicycles. Even the knee-jerk cod-psychedelia of &quot;King Midas in Reverse&quot;--a full-on trumpets-blaring, cello-charging microcosm of Revolver and Sgt. Pepper-isms--deserves revisionist plaudits. There is one newly recorded track on the album (featuring Allan Clarke's replacement, the former Move vocalist Carl Wayne) called &quot;How Do I Survive&quot;. Regrettably, it's a disco-cum-AOR rock thing that sounds like the result of an unfortunate liaison between James Ingram and Foreigner. Still, when faced with the spine-tingling, classic gold timelessness of &quot;He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother&quot; and &quot;The Air That I Breathe,&quot; it would matter not one jot if the bonus track was a three-part harmony rendition of a page out of the telephone directory.\n\nCD 2\n\n1.
