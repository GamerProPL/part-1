SQ3R shows students the relationship between psychological theory and learning. It is the strongest and most comprehensive program for measuring progress and attaining successful outcomes in Introductory Psychology.\nMyPsychLab is an integral part of the Wood/Wood/Boyd program. Engaging activities and assessments provide a teaching and learning system that measures studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ success. With MyPsychLab, students can watch videos on psychological research and applications, participate in virtual classic experiments, and develop critical thinking skills through writing.\n\nAbout the Authors\nSamuel E.
