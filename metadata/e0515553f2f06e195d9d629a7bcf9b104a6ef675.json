As the story opens, a haunted Hercules (Johnson) travels Greece with his five loyal companions, capitalizing on his heroic reputation by selling his services for gold. When a malevolent warlord threatens to thrust the kingdom of Thrace into chaos, however, its desperate ruler and his daughter turn to Hercules to restore the peace. In order to succeed, Hercules must once again summon the strength and valor that once made him a myth among men. Joseph Fiennes, Ian McShane, and Rufus Sewell co-star. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0515553f2f06e195d9d629a7bcf9b104a6ef675","amp;dn":"Hercules+-+with+the+rock+2014.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0515553f2f06e195d9d629a7bcf9b104a6ef675","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,81,85,83,242,240,110,25,93,157,98,154,123,207,155,16,74,110,246,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
