Understanding Comics was a Harvey and Eisner winner, was praised in The New York Times, Publishers Weekly and Wired, and is in over 13 languages. A favorite of interface, game and Web designers despite the fact that it doesn't mention computers once!&quot;\n\n&quot;If you've ever felt bad about wasting your life reading comics, then check out Scott McCloud's classic book immediately. You might still feel you've wasted your life, but you'll know why, and you'll be proud.&quot;\n- Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons.\n\n&quot;In one lucid, well-designed chapter after another, [McCloud] guides us through the elements of comics style, and... how words combine with pictures to work their singular magic. When the 215-page journey is finally over, most readers will find it difficult to look at comics in quite the same way ever again.&quot;\n- New York Times Review of Books review by Garry Trudeau","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f68828ffad86098b92c1ee9009a6c42a066d4771","amp;dn":"Scott+McCloud+-+Understanding+Comics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f68828ffad86098b92c1ee9009a6c42a066d4771","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,136,40,255,173,134,9,139,146,193,238,144,9,166,196,42,6,109,71,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
