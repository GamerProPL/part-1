It has never been told in full until now.\r\n\r\nGeneral Alexander Orlov, Stalin's most loyal and trusted henchman during the Spanish Civil War, was also the Soviet handler controlling Kim Philby, the British spy, defector, and member of the notorious 'Cambridge Five'. Escaping Stalin's purges, Orlov fled to America in the late 1930s and lived underground. He only dared reveal his identity to the world after Stalin's death, in his 1953 best-seller The Secret History of Stalin's Crimes, after which he became perhaps the best known of all Soviet defectors, much written about, highly praised, and commemorated by the US Congress on his death in 1973","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f1e302fff1390098c909ffe26330461c0050bd0","amp;dn":"Stalin%27s+Agent%3A+The+Life+and+Death+of+Alexander+Orlov","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f1e302fff1390098c909ffe26330461c0050bd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,30,48,47,255,19,144,9,140,144,159,254,38,51,4,97,192,5,11,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
