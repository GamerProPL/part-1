And I noticed there where\nsome complains about the complete seasons/sets I could find. Mostly that it was poor\nquality, probably because it used the rather poor PAL transfer as it's sources.\nSo I ripped my own discs from the NTSC Limited Edition complete box set instead and\nfigured I would toss season 1 up here and see if there's any interest in it.\nIf there is I will consider posting the other seasons as well.\n\n------------------------------------------\n Season 1, Episode 1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Aired: 3/10/1997\nWelcome to the Hellmouth (1)\n\nBuffy Summers is the Slayer, but after being expelled from her old high school for burning down the gym (it was full of vampires) she just wants to forget about her destiny and be a normal sixteen-year-old girl.
