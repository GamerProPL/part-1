ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s is a feast of virtuoso performances, shifting moods and textures, and detailed background work by Charles MingusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ eleven-piece band. Mingus also clearly draws on experiences gleaned from his long-standing relationship with Duke Ellington, and even acknowledges the flamenco themes brought to prominence by Miles Davis and Gil EvansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sketches of Spain; haunting bluesiness, dancing vivacity, and moments of Andalusian heat. One of the high-water marks for avant-garde jazz in the '60s and arguably Mingus' most brilliant moment.\n\n\nCharles Mingus\n\nThe Black Saint and the Sinner Lady \n\n(From A Poem: &quot;Touch my beloved's thought while her world's affluence crumbles at my feet.&quot;)\n\n1963\n\n\n  CD / 1995 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist: \n\n1.
