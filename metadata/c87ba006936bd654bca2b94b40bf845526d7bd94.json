Without these drivers, the       \n  system will not be able to distinguish between a display card and a         \n  mouse. Most of these drivers are installed along with the operating         \n  system. However, with time, these existing drivers get outdated,            \n  resulting in poor system performance and limited hardware functionality.    \n  Therefore, it is very important to update the drivers on your system from   \n  time to time.                                                               \n                                                                              \n  To do so manually is a tedious task. You will first have to determine the   \n  model and make of the hardware device, go to the manufacturers website,     \n  then download and install the most recent and updated drivers for it.       \n  Most of the times, you will have problems finding the right driver for      \n  your computer, or the one you install may be incompatible. However, using   \n  Advanced Driver Updater, this can be done easily, quickly and efficiently.  \n                                                                              \n  Advanced Driver Updater has an extensive database which consists of the     \n  latest and most updated drivers in the market. It scans your system and     \n  displays a list of outdated drivers. All you need to do to update to the    \n  most recent ones is click a button. A backup of the old drivers is taken    \n  automatically and the newest drivers are installed. It is just that         \n  simple. If you do not like the latest driver or it is causing any           \n  problems, you can easily restore the backup.                                \n                                                                              \n  Having Advanced Driver Updater on your system makes sense, because having   \n  the most recent drivers do. They give you enhanced functionality,           \n  minimize erratic behavior and improve system performance.                   \n\n                                                                      \n          \n[  HOW TO INSTALL/RUN THIS RELEASE  ]\n                                                                             \n o1  Unpack the release into a directory of your choice.                    \n o2  Run the installer and install it.                                      \n o3  Copy the files from /crack into the installation directory.            \n o4  Have a go with this unlimited trial, but buy it if you will use it.    \n o5  As always, make sure to have a firewall to block outbound connections. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c87ba006936bd654bca2b94b40bf845526d7bd94","amp;dn":"SysTweak+Advanced+Driver+Updater+2.1.1086.15131","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c87ba006936bd654bca2b94b40bf845526d7bd94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,123,160,6,147,107,214,84,188,162,185,75,64,191,132,85,38,215,189,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
