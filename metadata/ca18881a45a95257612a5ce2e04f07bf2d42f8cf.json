Formed in 1967, the band cultivated a following during the 1970s and achieved significant commercial success throughout the 1980s. Hi Infidelity (1980) contained four US Top 40 hits and is the group's best-selling album, with over ten million copies sold.\n\nOver the course of its career, the band has sold more than 40 million records and has charted thirteen Top 40 hits, including the number ones &quot;Keep On Loving You&quot; and &quot;Can't Fight This Feeling&quot;. REO Speedwagon's mainstream popularity dissipated in the 1990s but the band remains a popular live act.\n\nThey named the band REO Speedwagon, from the REO Speed Wagon, a flatbed truck Doughty had studied in transportation history, and the initials are those of its founder Ransom E. Olds. Rather than pronouncing REO as a single word as the motor company did, they chose to spell out the name with the individual letters each pronounced.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca18881a45a95257612a5ce2e04f07bf2d42f8cf","amp;dn":"REO+Speedwagon+-+The+Hits+%5B1988%5D%5B2002%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca18881a45a95257612a5ce2e04f07bf2d42f8cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,24,136,26,69,169,82,87,97,42,92,226,224,79,7,191,45,66,248,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
