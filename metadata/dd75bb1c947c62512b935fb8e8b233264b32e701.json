Produced by Josh Wilbur, the album features 14 songs and comes in a deluxe softpak with artwork by longtime art director Ken Adams.\n\nResolution is a 100 percent trend-free and intelligently constructed album that could power a small country with its unstoppable energy and potent riffery. Guitarist Mark Morton says that &quot;unlike any other album before, this album was written over the course of a couple of years, at least with the guitars. Willie and I starting songwriting as soon as we started touring Wrath.&quot; As a result, Resolution boasts some of the most punk rock moments and some of the bluesiest moments of the band's recorded career, perhaps fostered along by the liveliness of the writing-on-the-road process. The album was recorded in various studios in Virginia and New York. \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                      Lamb Of God - Resolution\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Lamb Of God\nAlbum................: Resolution\nGenre................: Metal\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2012\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; \nCodec................: FhG\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v1.1, ID3 v2.3\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: Team BriBerY\n\n\nIncluded.............: M3U\nCovers...............: Front CD \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
