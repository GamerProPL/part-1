Conrad is regarded as one of the greatest novelists in English, though he did not speak the language fluently until he was in his twenties (and always with a marked accent).  He wrote stories and novels, often with a nautical setting, that depict trials of the human spirit in the midst of an indifferent universe.  He was a master prose stylist who brought a distinctly non-English tragic sensibility into English literature.\n\nWriting in the heyday of the British Empire, Conrad drew on his native Poland's national experiences and on his personal experiences in the French and British merchant navies, to create short stories and novels that reflect aspects of a European-dominated world, while plumbing the depths of the human soul.  Appreciated early on by literary cognoscenti, his fiction and nonfiction have gained an almost prophetic cachet in the light of subsequent national and international disasters of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\n\nWith one exception, the following files are all PDFs or retail ePUBs.
