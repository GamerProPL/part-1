Hanne Thomsen (Kirsten Olesen), the Copenhagen police officer assigned \r\nto work with her, appears not to like her, but denies that this is due to Saga's role in the \r\nincarceration of Martin Rohde, who is serving 10 years in prison for killing Jens. \r\nOn investigation it is discovered that Anker, a lesbian married to a Swedish woman, was the pioneer \r\nof Denmark's first gender-neutral preschool. \r\nHer work had been the target of numerous threats, including several vlog posts by right-wing lawyer \r\nLise Frise Andersen (Sonja Richter), whose husband owns the facility where Anker's body was discovered. \r\nWhile attempting to question Anker's son Morten (AsbjÃ¸rn Krogh Nissen), a mentally unstable veteran \r\nof the war in Afghanistan, Thomsen is wounded by a booby trap. Saga is then assigned a new Danish partner, \r\nHenrik Sabroe (Thure Lindhardt), whose private life seems murky. Henrik recognises Saga's neurological \r\ncondition almost immediately, and is more accommodating than Hanne. As the investigation progresses, \r\nSaga's bond with Henrik becomes deeper and more emotional.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical: (All episodes are encoded to the same settings)\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nComplete name                            : G:The Bridge S03The Bridge S03E01 x264 RB58.mp4\r\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\r\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\r\nCodec ID                                 : isom\r\nFile size                                : 637 MiB\r\nDuration                                 : 58mn 21s\r\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 525 Kbps\r\nWriting application                      : Lavf54.63.104\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nID                                       : 1\r\nFormat                                   : AVC\r\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile                           :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\r\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\r\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\r\nDuration                                 : 58mn 21s\r\nBit rate                                 : 1 400 Kbps\r\nWidth                                    : 832 pixels\r\nHeight                                   : 468 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\r\nFrame rate                               : 50.000 fps\r\nColor space                              : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\r\nScan type                                : Progressive\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.072\r\nStream size                              : 585 MiB (92%)\r\nWriting library                          : x264 core 123 r2189 35cf912\r\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nID                                       : 2\r\nFormat                                   : AAC\r\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\r\nFormat profile                           : LC\r\nCodec ID                                 : 40\r\nDuration                                 : 58mn 21s\r\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\r\nBit rate                                 : 112 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\r\nStream size                              : 46.7 MiB (7%)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fe968a776e3656b4933161ebb88b3d3210ee35e","amp;dn":"The+Bridge+%28Broen%2FBron%29+S03+x264+RB58","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fe968a776e3656b4933161ebb88b3d3210ee35e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,233,104,167,118,227,101,107,73,51,22,30,187,136,179,211,33,14,227,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
