They do things their way, creatively cutting their own path through it all. Unconcerned with the direction of other artists, their brand of gritty hardcore/punk is simply refreshing. Merging cryptic melody, dirty hardcore power, and intense dirge into their own uniquely inspired sound.\n\n&quot;I Am King&quot; is the new album from Code Orange (formerly Code Orange Kids), recorded at God City Studios by Kurt Ballou. Unpredictability is the law as Code Orange navigate through their distorted world. Title track &quot;I Am King&quot; shifts from &quot;heavy&quot; to &quot;hard to define&quot; through the use of unorthodox guitar work/percussion and chaotic structure. While songs &quot;Dreams in Inertia&quot;, &quot;Starve&quot;, and &quot;Bind You&quot; all wear an art-rock crown while claiming a metallic throne. It's not just melodious experimentation though, &quot;Unclean Spirit&quot;, &quot;My World&quot;, and &quot;Thinners of the Herd&quot; show Code Orange reimagining what aggressive music can be. Elevating and expanding what can be done within the confines of it without leaving it behind entirely. Proving that Code Orange are true artists and not just &quot;kids&quot; anymore.\n\n\n01 I Am King\n02 Slowburn\n03 Dreams in Inertia\n04 Unclean Spirit\n05 Alone in a Room\n06 My World\n07 Starve\n08 Your Body Is Ready...\n09 Thinners of the Herd\n10 Bind You\n11 Mercy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b63527da34da76bcf08b77c0bc0061d1fe6db3f9","amp;dn":"Code+Orange+-+I+Am++King++mp3++320k++++2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b63527da34da76bcf08b77c0bc0061d1fe6db3f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,53,39,218,52,218,118,188,240,139,119,192,188,0,97,209,254,109,179,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
