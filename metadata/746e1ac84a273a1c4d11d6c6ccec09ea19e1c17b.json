This is not your ordinary photo-to-painting effect! Instead of changing the pixels of the photo itself, DAP uses the input image only as a guide to paint the scene with many different brushes and guided by real-world artists inspired techniques.\r\n\r\nWhat's New in Dynamic Auto Painter Pro 5:\r\n\r\nNested Variations for presets \r\nEach preset can now have large number of nested variations and for this version we added a lot of them, in total more than 100 presets and variations. It seamlessly works with the Template editor where instead of creating new preset you can simply spawn a new variation.\r\n\r\nNew File management \r\nSaving or modifying presets is now done in user files and the new manager keeps track of what templates were modified and allows â€œrolling backâ€ to factory settings.\r\n\r\nBrand new Super-Layer system with huge number of effects \r\nThe new layer system allows you to apply infinite number of tweaks to the painted image, together with mixing various stages of painting together.\r\n\r\nLarge Pre-rendered previews for presets \r\nWith the numerous new variations it would be hard to judge the style from the tiny thumbnail so now each preset and variations shows pre-rendered large preview when you hover your mouse above the preset. You can easily set your own painted image as preview as well.\r\n\r\nBatch Processing \r\nSet it and let it run overnight! One of the most requested feature, now in two flavors:\r\nâ€¢ Single style can be applied to a folder full of images\r\nâ€¢ or you can process a single image with many different styles.\r\n\r\nReactor Effects now with more parameters \r\nYou can now access more reactor internal parameters dirrectly from DAP. There are about 150 prepared complex reactor effects to be used in your new painting styles and variations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:746e1ac84a273a1c4d11d6c6ccec09ea19e1c17b","amp;dn":"MediaChance+Dynamic+Auto+Painter+Pro+5.0.3+Incl+Key+%2B+Templetes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"746e1ac84a273a1c4d11d6c6ccec09ea19e1c17b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,110,26,200,74,39,58,28,77,17,214,198,204,236,9,234,25,225,193,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
