The most technologically advanced fighting force in the world relies on the best and most effective hand-to-hand fighting techniques ever developed. In H2H Combat, Soldiers Edition, the creator of SOCP (Special Operations Combatives Program), Greg Thompson, demonstrates the same combat and self-defense techniques he teaches to the Special Forces and Army troops. You will learn modern clinching, effective striking, basic weapon takeaway, knife defense, and grappling techniques that may someday save your life. This book is not only a must for the young recruit as well as the battle hardened expert, but also for anyone who is concerned about personal protection in this modern and aggressive world.\n\n=======================================\n\n\nHand-to-Hand Combat\n\nHeadquarters, Department of the US Army\n\nPublisher: Cosimo Reports\n1992\nEnglish\nISBN ..N/A\n228 Pages\nPDF\n9.48 MB\n\nOriginally published in 1954, the U.S. Army Hand-to-Hand Combat guide was the official field manual for soldiers.
