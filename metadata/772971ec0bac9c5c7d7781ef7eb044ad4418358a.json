HankÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contract ran out in 2010, and RamblinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Man is the third album Curb has released since Hank III moved on.\nWith only eight songs and a total running time of 27 minutes, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more like an EP than a full-length, and most of this material will sound pretty familiar to Hank III completists. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Okie from MuskogeeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the title cut both come from sessions with the Melvins that appeared on their 2000 album The Crybaby, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fearless BoogieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ comes from the 2002 ZZ Top tribute Sharp Dressed Men, Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m the OnlyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nHell (My Mamma Ever Raised)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ was previously released on the 2004 Johnny Paycheck tribute disc Touch My Heart, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Marijuana BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ popped up on the 2010 Peter La Farge tribute Rare Breed. Elsewhere, Ã¢â‚¬Å“On My OwnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a longer take of the same tune that appeared on Hank IIIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s RisinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Outlaw in 1999, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hang OnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was first released on the soundtrack to the 2001 Sylvester Stallone vehicle Driven. That leaves the previously bootleg-only Assjack track Ã¢â‚¬Å“RunninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and GunninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as the only Ã¢â‚¬Å“newÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ item to appear on RamblinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Man. While the mix of country and raw rock material on this collection certainly gives it more of the flavor of Hank IIIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s genre-bending style, RamblinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Man is best recommended for casual Hank III fans who havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t gotten caught up with many of the tracks heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cut for tribute albums and other collections; otherwise, this set feels short and not so sweet, despite the strength of a few genuinely strong tracks\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:772971ec0bac9c5c7d7781ef7eb044ad4418358a","amp;dn":"Hank+Williams+III+-+Ramblin%27+Man+%282014%29+MP3%40320kbps+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"772971ec0bac9c5c7d7781ef7eb044ad4418358a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,41,113,236,11,172,156,92,125,119,129,239,126,176,68,173,68,24,53,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
