Flaubert was inspired to turn Emma Bovary into â€œa knight in skirts.â€ Freud studied Quixoteâ€™s psyche. Mark Twain was fascinated by it, as were Kafka, Picasso, Nabokov, Borges, and Orson Welles. The novel has spawned ballets and operas, poems and plays, movies and video games, and even shapes the identities of entire nations. Spain uses it as a sort of constitution and travel guide; and the Americas were conquered, then sought their independence, with the knight as a role model.\r\n\r\nIn Quixote, Ilan Stavans, one of todayâ€™s preeminent cultural commentators, explores these many manifestations. Training his eye on the tumultuous struggle between logic and dreams, he reveals the ways in which a work of literature is a living thing that influences and is influenced by the world around it.\r\n\r\n8 pages of illustrations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c913ec6fa002f7e6b8ac49ae89435028bfc00b76","amp;dn":"Quixote%3A+The+Novel+and+the+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c913ec6fa002f7e6b8ac49ae89435028bfc00b76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,19,236,111,160,2,247,230,184,172,73,174,137,67,80,40,191,192,11,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
