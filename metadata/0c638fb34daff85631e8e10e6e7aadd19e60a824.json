It was conceived by vocalist Chris Cornell of Soundgarden as a tribute to his friend, the late Andrew Wood, lead singer of Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone. The line-up included Stone Gossard on rhythm guitar, Jeff Ament on bass guitar (both ex-members of Mother Love Bone), Mike McCready on lead guitar, Matt Cameron on drums, and Eddie Vedder providing some lead and backing vocals.\n\nThe band released its only album, the self-titled Temple of the Dog, in April 1991 through A&amp;M Records. Although earning praise from music critics at the time of its release, the album was not widely recognized until 1992, when Vedder, Ament, Gossard, and McCready had their breakthrough with Pearl Jam.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTemple of the Dog is the only studio album by the American rock band Temple of the Dog, released on April 16, 1991 through A&amp;M Records.
