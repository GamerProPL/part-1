Street gangs rule the day while fear and superstition rule the night. When warrior angels fly away with a helpless little girl, her seventeen-year-old sister Penryn will do anything to get her back.\n\nAnything, including making a deal with an enemy angel.\n\nRaffe is a warrior who lies broken and wingless on the street. After eons of fighting his own battles, he finds himself being rescued from a desperate situation by a half-starved teenage girl.\n\nTraveling through a dark and twisted Northern California, they have only each other to rely on for survival. Together, they journey toward the angelsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ stronghold in San Francisco where sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll risk everything to rescue her sister and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll put himself at the mercy of his greatest enemies for the chance to be made whole again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc9d6a059734fc524b1b6f0a650a637bd11a1bf0","amp;dn":"Angelfall+by+Susan+Ee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc9d6a059734fc524b1b6f0a650a637bd11a1bf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,157,106,5,151,52,252,82,75,27,111,10,101,10,99,123,209,26,27,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
