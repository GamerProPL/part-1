I have added covers, metadata and made sure all the chapters work within the TOC.\nTwo of the books I could not find decent covers so I made my own.. these are Sharpe's Christmas and Sharpe's Skirmish. I have made these available in the past, but I have added a couple of extra books and fixed a couple of small problems.\n\nI hope you enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96f2c9f641f07f5367ac4ae21ef3235f9b527816","amp;dn":"The+Bernard+Cornwell+Ebook+Collection++%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96f2c9f641f07f5367ac4ae21ef3235f9b527816","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,242,201,246,65,240,127,83,103,172,74,226,30,243,35,95,155,82,120,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
