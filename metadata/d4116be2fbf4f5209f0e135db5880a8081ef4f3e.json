The group consists of Black Francis (vocals, rhythm guitar), Joey Santiago (lead guitar), Kim Deal (bass guitar, vocals), and David Lovering (drums). While the Pixies found only modest success in their home country, they were significantly more successful in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe, although never achieving prolonged mainstream success with their studio albums. The group disbanded in 1993 in acrimonious circumstances but reunited in 2004.\n\nThe band's style of music contains elements including indie rock and surf rock. Francis is the Pixies' primary songwriter and singer who has been noted for his yowling delivery. He has typically written about offbeat subjects, such as extraterrestrials, surrealism and Biblical violence.\n\nThe group has been described as a big influence on the alternative rock boom of the 1990s, though they disbanded before reaping any of the benefits this might have brought them. Avowed fan Kurt Cobain's acknowledgement of the debt his band Nirvana owed to the Pixies, along with similar tributes by other alternative bands, helped the Pixies' legacy and popularity grow in the years following their break-up, leading to sold-out tours following their reunion in 2004.\n\n.: Pixies Group :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img122.imageshack.us/img122/3209/pixiesmv0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img122.imageshack.us/img122/3209/pixiesmv0.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nSurfer Rosa/Come On Pilgrim - 1988\nDoolittle - 1989\nBossanova - 1990\nTrompe Le Monde - 1991\nDeath To The Pixies 1987-1991 - 1997\nPixies At The BBC - 1998\nComplete 'B' Sides - 2001\nPixies - 2002\nWave Of Mutilation - Best Of Pixies - 2004\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4116be2fbf4f5209f0e135db5880a8081ef4f3e","amp;dn":"Pixies+-+Discography+1988+2004+%5BMp3+VBR%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4116be2fbf4f5209f0e135db5880a8081ef4f3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,17,107,226,251,244,245,32,159,14,19,93,181,136,10,128,129,239,79,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
