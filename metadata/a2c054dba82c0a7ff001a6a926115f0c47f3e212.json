A train robber by trade, Jericho spots an unusual target racing down the tracks under the light of the full moon and decides to pillage it as his final score before retiring. Jericho is shocked to discover that the unusually designed train is packed with rotting bodies with a humanoid look he cannot recognize. Cross soon finds himself in a battle for his life against a horde of vampires and other nasties.\n\n\nDo you missing a game?
