Law 1: Never Outshine the Master. Law 3: Conceal Your Intentions. Law 7: Get Others to Do the Work for You, but Always Take the Credit. Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally. Law 33: Discover Each Man&amp;#039;s Thumbscrew.\n\nThese are the laws of power in their unvarnished essence?the philosophies of Machiavelli (The Prince), Sun-tzu (The Art of War), Carl von Clausewitz, Talleyrand, the great seducer Casanova, con man Yellow Kid Weil, and other legendary thinkers and schemers. They teach prudence, stealth, mastery of one&amp;#039;s emotions, the art of deception, and the total absence of mercy. Like it or not, all have practical applications in real life.\n\nEach law is illustrated with examples of observance or transgression drawn from history and featuring such famous figures as Queen Elizabeth I, Henry Kissinger, Mao, Alfred Hitchcock, P.T. Barnum, Haile Selassie, Catherine the Great, and Socrates. Convincing, practical, sometimes shocking, this book will fascinate anyone interested in gaining, observing, or defending against ultimate control.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c0d1b7b852d7a1683beb4b183f9cfcb3e8c3398","amp;dn":"48+Laws+of+Power-+Audiobook%2C+Robert+Greene","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c0d1b7b852d7a1683beb4b183f9cfcb3e8c3398","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,13,27,123,133,45,122,22,131,190,180,177,131,249,207,203,62,140,51,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
