Kate McDermott has taught this and made pies with thousands of people across the country at her Pie Camps. Her confidence comes through in every recipe, and will inspire readers to don an apron, grab a rolling pin, and get cooking. (The stunning photographs in this book wonÃ¢Â€â„¢t hurt either.) Over the years, McDermott developed more than a dozen crusts, half of which are gluten-free, and in this book she gives detailed instructions for making, rolling, and baking crusts. A pie needs filling, too, and she does not neglect a single detail when describing her ingredients, methods, and tricks for making the filling and finishing off the pie. Recipes include:\r\n\r\nBlackberry Pie for Julia Child\r\nThe Best Peach Pie in the World\r\nOld-Fashioned Rhubarb Pie","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:012b39000e82832eeace8c747424fccf60ebe48d","amp;dn":"Art+of+the+Pie+Practical+Guide+to+Homemade+%282016%29+%5BWWRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"012b39000e82832eeace8c747424fccf60ebe48d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,43,57,0,14,130,131,46,234,206,140,116,116,36,252,207,96,235,228,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
