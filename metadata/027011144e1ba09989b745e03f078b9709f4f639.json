Having sold over one million records worldwide, the band completed a sell out Academy tour in 2008 and went on to smash the international festival circuit in summer 2009 with killer appearances at Glastonbury, Download, V and Global Gathering to name a few. Both Pendulum studio albums to date-In Silico and the band's debut Hold Your Colour-have gone Platinum.\n\nImmersion's lead single &quot;Watercolour&quot; heralds a glorious evolution in the Pendulum sound. Now utilising a richer sonic tapestry than ever before, Watercolour&quot; finds Rob Swire's vocals alternating between eerie distortion and full-blooded energy amidst flourishes of horns and an atmospheric, tension building breakdown. The track's progressive structure highlight's Pendulum's continuing development in constructing contrasting dynamics.\n\n01. Genesis (1:09)\n02. Salt In The Wounds (6:39)\n03. Watercolour (5:04)\n04.
