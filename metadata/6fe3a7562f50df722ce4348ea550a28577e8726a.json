Some try to fight back, like teens Ciro (Ciro Petrone) and Marco (Marco Macor), who decide to steal a Camorra weapons cache in a bid to take control themselves. Others try to hide, like Pasquale (Salvatore Cantalupo), a tailor trying to get around paying protection fees. But the realization sets in: The Camorra is too large, too deeply embedded in Italy to be fought.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe Series (2014) - &quot;Ciro disregards tradition in his attempt to become the next boss of his crime syndicate. The internal power struggle puts him and his entire family's life at risk. &quot;\r\n\r\n_____________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nName (Title): Gomorrah: 2008 Film + La Serie (Season 1 S01) - 720p HC Eng Subs\r\n\r\nCategory Type: TV Series\r\n\r\nLength (Duration): 45-60 Minutes per Episode\r\n\r\nYear(s): 2008 (Movie) and 2014 (Season 1 of Series).\r\n\r\nStarring: Marco D'Amore, Fortunato Cerlino, Salvatore Esposito, Maria Pia Calzone, Marco Palvetti\r\n\r\nGenre(s): Crime, Drama, Thriller, Action, Suspense\r\n\r\nResolution: 720p\r\n\r\nRip Type (Source): BrRip\r\n\r\nCodec Type: x264\r\n\r\nFormat of File(s): MP4(s)\r\n\r\nAudio Format &amp; Language(s): AC3 5.1 640 kbps (&quot;Neapolitan&quot; ITALIAN).\r\n\r\nSubtitles: Yes (HARDCODED -English- Subs throughout).\r\n\r\nChapters: YES (only for the 2008 Movie though).\r\n\r\nIMDB Link(s): \r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0929425/\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2049116/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fe3a7562f50df722ce4348ea550a28577e8726a","amp;dn":"Gomorrah%3A+2008+Film+%2B+La+Serie+%28Season+1+S01%29+-+720p+HC+Eng+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fe3a7562f50df722ce4348ea550a28577e8726a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,227,167,86,47,80,223,114,44,228,52,142,165,80,162,133,119,232,114,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
