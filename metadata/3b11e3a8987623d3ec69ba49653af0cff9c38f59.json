Its perimeter is protected by the villagers' charms, but beyond the legends and the magic, the gloomy forests and wailing wind, lies a chasm so deep and feared, it is known by the villagers only as The Abyss. No one knows what lies within, but when a strange visitor arrives in Ravenbrook just before a young bride is kidnapped, the villagers find justification for their superstitionsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n\nOn this night, a young woman returns home for her twin sister's wedding. They haven't seen each other in years. But the ceremony is interrupted by the intrusion of a gigantic bear Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a dark hero of local legend, who kidnaps the bride. Wasting no time, and accompanied by Edward Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the would-be husband of her sister - the Heroine follows the beast's trail deep into a world of legends and magic. The quest to find Lilly will lead her sister through a dangerous, mystical forest full of fairies and magical beings, as well as places that put an unspeakable terror into the hearts of simple folk. Each clue leading to her kidnapped sister will bring the heroine closer to the truth about her and her sister. The main protagonist will learn that words spoken in a world where ancient magic is part of the reality have a tremendous power.
