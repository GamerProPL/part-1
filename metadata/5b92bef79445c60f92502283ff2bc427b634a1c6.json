By lyrically exploring different topics, they have also avoided making an album that sounds the same as every other Aussie hip hop record Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a trap that many fall into.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b92bef79445c60f92502283ff2bc427b634a1c6","amp;dn":"Thundamentals+-+So+We+Can+Remember+2014+Album+MP3+320kbs+alexyjh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b92bef79445c60f92502283ff2bc427b634a1c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,146,190,247,148,69,198,15,146,80,34,131,255,43,196,39,182,52,161,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
