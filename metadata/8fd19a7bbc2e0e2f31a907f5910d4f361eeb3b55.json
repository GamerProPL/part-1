Celebrated in rarified literary and social circles, she was hailed, alongside Mark Lindquist, Bret Easton Ellis, and Jay McInerney, as one of the original â€œBrat Packâ€ writersâ€”a wave of young minimalist authors whose wry, urbane sensibility captured the zeitgeist of the time, propelling them to the forefront of American culture.\r\n\r\nIn Scream, her first memoir, Janowitz recalls the quirky literary world of young downtown New York in the go-go 1980s and reflects on her life today far away from the city indelible to her work. As in Slaves of New York and A Certain Age, Janowitz turns a critical eye towards life, this time her own, recounting the vagaries of fame and fortune as a writer devoted to her art. Here, too, is Tama as daughter, wife, and mother, wrestling with aging, loss, and angst, both adolescent (her daughter) and middle aged (her own) as she cares for a mother plagued by dementia, battles a brother who questions her choices, and endures the criticism of a surly teenager.\r\nFilled with a very real, very personal cast of characters, Scream is an intimate, scorching memoir rife with the humor, insight, and experience of a writer with a surgeonÃ¢Â€â„¢s eye for detail, and a skill for cutting straight to the strangest parts of life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fd19a7bbc2e0e2f31a907f5910d4f361eeb3b55","amp;dn":"Scream%3A+A+Memoir+of+Glamour+and+Dysfunction+%282016%29+Tama+Janowitz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fd19a7bbc2e0e2f31a907f5910d4f361eeb3b55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,209,154,123,188,46,14,47,49,169,7,245,145,13,79,54,30,235,59,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
