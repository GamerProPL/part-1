First broadcast on March 30, 2001 (the same day as The Fairly OddParents), the show&amp;#039;s strange animation, quirky humor, and dark, cynical style gave it a devoted cult following, with an audience of an older average age than those of most of Nickelodeon&amp;#039;s other cartoons. Because of this, ratings for Nickelodeon&amp;#039;s core demographic, 2-11 year olds, were fairly low. Disappointed with its low ratings and high production costs, Nickelodeon cancelled the show. One and a half seasons of Invader Zim were completed.\n\n640x480 XviD AC3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76d36a9ba09289a4f0e2f563c3634d816502454a","amp;dn":"Invader+Zim%2C+Complete+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76d36a9ba09289a4f0e2f563c3634d816502454a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,211,106,155,160,146,137,164,240,226,245,99,195,99,77,129,101,2,69,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
