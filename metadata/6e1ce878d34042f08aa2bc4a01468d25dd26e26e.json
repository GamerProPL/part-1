Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, including members of Dylan's live backing band, The Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final albumÃ¢â‚¬â€&quot;One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)&quot;. At producer Bob Johnston's suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist Al Kooper, and guitarist Robbie Robertson moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee. These sessions, augmented by some of Nashville's top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded.\n\nBlonde on Blonde completed the trilogy of rock albums that Dylan recorded in 1965 and 1966, starting with Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited. Critics often rank Blonde on Blonde as one of the greatest albums of all time. Combining the expertise of Nashville session musicians with a modernist literary sensibility, the album's songs have been described as operating on a grand scale musically, while featuring lyrics one critic called &quot;a unique blend of the visionary and the colloquial&quot;. It was one of the first double albums in rock music.\n\nTrack Listing 2013 Remaster [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:36\n    &quot;Pledging My Time&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:50\n    &quot;Visions of Johanna&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:33\n    &quot;One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:54\n    &quot;I Want You&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:07\n    &quot;Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:05\n    &quot;Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:58\n    &quot;Just Like a Woman&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:52\n    &quot;Most Likely You Go Your Way (And I'll Go Mine)&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:30\n    &quot;Temporary Like Achilles&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:02\n    &quot;Absolutely Sweet Marie&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:57\n    &quot;4th Time Around&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:35\n    &quot;Obviously 5 Believers&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:35\n    &quot;Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 11:23","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e1ce878d34042f08aa2bc4a01468d25dd26e26e","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Blonde+On+Blonde+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e1ce878d34042f08aa2bc4a01468d25dd26e26e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,28,232,120,211,64,66,240,138,162,188,74,1,70,141,37,221,38,226,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
