Alien Skin Software has released a steady stream of highly regarded tools for photographers and graphic designers.

This plug-ins bundle contains their all newly update graphic softwares, which are Blow Up, Bokeh, Exposure, Eye Candy, Snap Art, that are able to work on Windows platform.\r\n\r\nAlien Skin Exposure\r\nExposure helps you visually explore carefully designed looks, reducing the need to fiddle with techy controls. The redesigned user interface in Exposure 5 reduces distraction and provides new ways to quickly find your style. There is a much wider range of textures and new controls to subtly combine them. Exposure works everywhere you do, now with Aperture support and as a stand-alone application that provides easy batch processing.\r\n\r\nAlien Skin Blow Up\r\nBlow Up keeps photos crystal clear during enlargement. Especially in large prints hung on a wall, the difference between Blow Up and Photoshop is astounding. Version 3 makes pictures even sharper without computer artifacts. If you understand PhotoshopÃ¢Â€â„¢s resize command then you already know how to use Blow Up. Our large library of standard paper sizes makes it even easier. With Lightroom and CMYK support, Blow Up fits into a professional workflow.\r\n\r\nAlien Skin Snap Art\r\nSnap Art turns your photograph into a beautiful work of art that looks completely handmade. Improved realism in version 3 keeps your subject natural and recognizable. The result is a finished piece worthy of printing on canvas and hanging in a gallery. Using Snap Art just requires a creative idea, not hand-eye coordination or technical training. Simply choose from hundreds of styles such as oil paint, watercolor, pencil sketch, or the new crayon. If you need more control, the new detail mask letÃ¢Â€â„¢s you quickly mark areas where you want the subject to be clearer.\r\n\r\nAlien Skin Bokeh\r\nBokeh 2 provides a wide range of creative focus effects and accurate lens simulation in a simple interface. Photographers use Bokeh to draw attention to their subject by manipulating focus, vignette, and depth of field.
