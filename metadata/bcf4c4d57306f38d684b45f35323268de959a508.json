Prior to the album's recording, Mos Def had collaborated with rapper Talib Kweli for the duo's studio album, Mos Def &amp; Talib Kweli are Black Star (1998). Black on Both Sides received widespread critical praise upon its release. \nTalib Kweli (one-half of Black Star with Mos Def) and Busta Rhymes are the only main rappers to be featured on the album. Kweli raps the second and final verse of &quot;Know That&quot;, while Busta goes back and forth with Mos on &quot;Do It Now&quot;. Q-Tip helps sing the chorus on &quot;Mr. Nigga&quot; but doesn't deliver a verse. The lyrics Q-Tip recites are similar to his previously stated lyrics on A Tribe Called Quest's &quot;Sucka Nigga&quot;. Vinia Mojica (who is known for singing on Native Tongues songs) also sings a duet with Mos Def on the song &quot;Climb&quot;.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Fear Not Of Man\n[02] Hip Hop\n[03] Love\n[04] Ms. Fat Booty\n[05] Speed Law\n[06] Do It Now\n[07] Got\n[08] Umi Says\n[09] New World Water\n[10] Rock 'N' Roll\n[11] Know That\n[12] Climb\n[13] Brooklyn\n[14] Habitat\n[15] Mr. Nigga\n[16] Mathematics\n[17] May-December\n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 01h:11m:27s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 174mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.2.1.6 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic video Format \t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi 200dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Hip Hop Rap\n\nOriginally Released\t- 12 October 1999\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Rawkus\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.mosdef.com  \n\t\t\t- \n\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcf4c4d57306f38d684b45f35323268de959a508","amp;dn":"%5B1999%5D+Black+On+Both+Sides+-+Mos+Def+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcf4c4d57306f38d684b45f35323268de959a508","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,244,196,213,115,6,243,141,104,75,69,243,83,35,38,141,233,89,165,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
