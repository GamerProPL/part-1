She is left with only words. But the right words can be as deadly as any blade. She must conquer her fears and sharpen her wits to a lethal edge if she is to reclaim her birthright.\n\nOnly half a war is fought with swords\n\nThe deep-cunning Father Yarvi has walked a long road from crippled slave to kingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s minister. He has made allies of old foes and stitched together an uneasy peace. But now the ruthless Grandmother Wexen has raised the greatest army since the elves made war on God, and put Bright Yilling at its head Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a man who worships no god but Death.\n\nSometimes one must fight evil with evil\n\nSome Ã¢â‚¬â€œ like Thorn Bathu and the sword-bearer Raith Ã¢â‚¬â€œ are born to fight, perhaps to die. Others Ã¢â‚¬â€œ like Brand the smith and Koll the wood-carver Ã¢â‚¬â€œ would rather stand in the light. But when Mother War spreads her iron wings, she may cast the whole Shattered Sea into darkness","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a890ca33fda38f79ce637a030ad26225ed07b2dd","amp;dn":"Joe+Abercrombie+-+Half+a+War+%28Shattered+Sea+%233%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a890ca33fda38f79ce637a030ad26225ed07b2dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,144,202,51,253,163,143,121,206,99,122,3,10,210,98,37,237,7,178,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
