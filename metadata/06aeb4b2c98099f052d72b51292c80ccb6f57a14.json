Now, in an entertaining and accessible primer, he explains how the global economy actually works - in real-world terms.\nWriting with irreverent wit, a deep knowledge of history, and a disregard for conventional economic pieties, Chang offers insights that will never be found in the textbooks. Unlike many economists, who present only one view of their discipline, Chang introduces a wide range of economic theories, from classical to Keynesian, revealing how each has its strengths and weaknesses, and why there is no one way to explain economic behavior. By ignoring the received wisdom and exposing the myriad forces that shape our financial world, Chang gives us the tools we need to understand our increasingly global and interconnected world often driven by economics.\nFrom the future of the Euro, inequality in China, or the condition of the American manufacturing industry here in the United States - Economics: The UserÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guide is a concise and expertly crafted guide to economic fundamentals that offers a clear and accurate picture of the global economy and how and why it affects our daily lives","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06aeb4b2c98099f052d72b51292c80ccb6f57a14","amp;dn":"Economics%3A+The+User%27s+Guide+-+Ha-Joon+Chang+-+Audiobook+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06aeb4b2c98099f052d72b51292c80ccb6f57a14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,174,180,178,201,128,153,240,82,215,43,81,41,44,128,204,182,245,122,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
