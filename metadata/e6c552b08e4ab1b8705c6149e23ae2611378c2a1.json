The application installs itself as a virtual printer on the userâ€™s computer. Once the file to be converted is opened, the user only needs to choose the â€œUniversal Document Converterâ€ printer and â€œprintâ€ the file for the conversion to successfully take place.\r\n\r\nUniversal Document Converter is capable of converting a document from its current format into one of eight different output formats, including popular options like PDF, JPEG, DCX, BMP, PCX, GIF and even high quality TIFF and PNG image files.
