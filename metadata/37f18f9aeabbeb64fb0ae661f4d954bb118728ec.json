Those frustrations boil over into a raucous viral-videoed public confrontation against a restaurant critic who panned his cooking of food that his boss ordered him to make against his instincts. Now with his career ruined, Carl's ex-wife offers an unorthodox solution in Miami: refit an old food truck to offer quality cooking on his own terms. Now with his young son, Percy, and old colleague, Martin, helping, Carl takes a working trip across America with that truck to rediscover his gastronomic passion. With Percy's tech savvy and Martin's enthusiasm, Carl finds that he is creating a traveling sensation on the way home. In doing so, Carl discovers he is serving up more than simply food, but also a deeper connection with his life and his family that is truly delicious in its own way.\n\n\nGeneral\n\n       \nFormat.......: Matroska\nFile Size....: 3.31 GiB\nDuration.....: 1h 49mn\nBitrate......: 4 306 Kbps\nSubtitles....: English\nEncoder&quot;.......JYK\nSource.......: BluRay\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2883512/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2883512/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\nVideo Format......: AVC\nVideo Codec.......: x264 core 142 r2431 ac76440     \nBitrate...........: 3 550 Kbps\nFrame Rate........: 25.000 fps\nWidth.............: 1 920 pixels\nHeight............: 800 pixels\naspect ratio......: 2.40:1\n\n\n\nAudio\n\n\nFormat..........: DTS\nBitrate.........: 755 Kbps\nChannels........: 6 channels\nSampling Rate...: 48.0 KHz\nBit depth.......: 24 bits\nLanguage........: English\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/k7i6cfJ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/k7i6cfJ.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/rlqaEx0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/rlqaEx0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/OXusPrH.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/OXusPrH.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bWJjKDj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bWJjKDj.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/EAmIPmP.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/EAmIPmP.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37f18f9aeabbeb64fb0ae661f4d954bb118728ec","amp;dn":"Chef+2014+1080p+BRRip+x264+DTS-JYK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37f18f9aeabbeb64fb0ae661f4d954bb118728ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,241,143,154,234,187,235,100,251,10,230,97,244,217,84,187,17,135,40,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
