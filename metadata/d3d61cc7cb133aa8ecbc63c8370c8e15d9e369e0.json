This contains the game itself, two updates, the songs from the original Rocksmith and the DLCs released for the new one (as of 29th, October).\n\nIt is not my release, the base game is the 3DM release. I've collected the rest from around the internet. So, respect to the original uploaders!\n\n\nTo run the game, you simply need to copy the files from the folders of updates and DLCs to the game's folder and overwrite. Here's the order:\n\n1 Update 1\n2 Update 2\n3 Imports from the original Rocksmith\n4 DLCs for the new Rocksmith\n5 Crack\n\n\nThis is the order I used, and the game works perfectly for me. If it crashes for you, try deleting 'videodump.txt' from the root folder.\n\n\n\nEnjoy, and buy the game if you like it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3d61cc7cb133aa8ecbc63c8370c8e15d9e369e0","amp;dn":"Rocksmith+2014+%2B+All+updates+and+DLCs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3d61cc7cb133aa8ecbc63c8370c8e15d9e369e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,214,28,199,203,19,58,168,236,188,99,200,55,12,142,21,217,227,105,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
