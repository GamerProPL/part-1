He then joined the Cleveland-based hard rock trio the James Gang, appearing on their debut LP Yer' Album. The trio's 1970 album, The James Gang Rides Again, proved the group's commercial breakthrough, launching the FM radio favorite &quot;Funk #49&quot; and achieving gold status. While the follow-up, Thirds, was another success, yielding the classic &quot;Walk Away,&quot; Walsh found the James Gang's power-trio format too confining and left the group soon after.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Funk #49\n02.Tend My Garden\n03.The Bomber\n04.Walk Away\n05.Midnight Man\n06.Mother Says\n07.Turn To Stone\n08.Meadows\n09.Rocky Mountain Way\n10.Help Me Thru The Night\n11.Life's Been Good\n12.All Night Long\n13.The Confessor\n14.A Life Of Illusion\n15.Ordinary Average Guy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a130d4b625ffdf3f6c7e1319d77f7398849161d1","amp;dn":"Joe+Walsh+-+Greatest+Hits+%281997%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a130d4b625ffdf3f6c7e1319d77f7398849161d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,48,212,182,37,255,223,63,108,126,19,25,215,127,115,152,132,145,97,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
