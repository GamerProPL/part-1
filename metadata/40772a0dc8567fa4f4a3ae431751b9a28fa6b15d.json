Instead of creating patches the conventional way by turning dials and knobs, Synplant lets you explore a world of organic sounds by planting seeds that grow into synth patches.\n\nOnce you are ready to get your hands dirty and dig deeper into the anatomy of Synplant you will have the option to crack open your sound seeds and modify their underlying genetic code.\n\nGrow, Mutate, Create\n\nThe purÃ‚Â­pose of this product is to move foÃ‚Â­cus away from the someÃ‚Â­times inÃ‚Â­tricÃ‚Â­ate and difÃ‚Â­fiÃ‚Â­cult proÃ‚Â­cess of sound synÃ‚Â­thesÃ‚Â­is and inÃ‚Â­stead let you deÃ‚Â­velÃ‚Â­op sounds by simply usÃ‚Â­ing your ears. You will find that creÃ‚Â­atÃ‚Â­ing synth patches with SynÃ‚Â­plant will be as easy as listenÃ‚Â­ing and deÃ‚Â­cidÃ‚Â­ing what you like and then havÃ‚Â­ing the sounds evolve in the dirÃ‚Â­ecÃ‚Â­tions you deÃ‚Â­sire.\n\nOnce you are ready to get your hands dirty and dig deepÃ‚Â­er inÃ‚Â­to the anaÃ‚Â­tomy of SynÃ‚Â­plant you will have the opÃ‚Â­tion to crack open your sound seeds and modiÃ‚Â­fy their unÃ‚Â­derÃ‚Â­lyÃ‚Â­ing geÃ‚Â­netÃ‚Â­ic code.\n\nAlÃ‚Â­though SynÃ‚Â­plant is exÃ‚Â­ceedÃ‚Â­ingly easy to use, whatever you do, do not let its reÃ‚Â­lÃ‚Â­atÃ‚Â­ive simÃ‚Â­pliÃ‚Â­city fool you. BeÃ‚Â­neath its straightÃ‚Â­forÃ‚Â­ward and playÃ‚Â­ful inÃ‚Â­terÃ‚Â­face you will find a verÃ‚Â­satÃ‚Â­ile synÃ‚Â­thesÃ‚Â­izer of the utÃ‚Â­most qualÃ‚Â­ity with lots of charÃ‚Â­acÃ‚Â­ter. \nCode:\nRequirements\n\n\nThe minimum requirements for installing and running Synplant under Microsoft Windows\nare:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Microsoft Windows XP or later\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A host application that supports 32-/64-bit VST 2.4 plug-ins\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 2GHz Pentium IV or equivalent\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 30MB of free disk space\n\n\n\nInstall\n\n1.Uninstall previous versions.\n2.Install.\n3.Replace files with our cracked ones.\n4.Run the plugin and start registration.\n5.Input your (fake) name, (fake) email and any serials, then register.\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ That's it!
