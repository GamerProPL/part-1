Choose from the 100+ building parts you have at your disposal and create anything from crazy transforming vehicles to a house that moves. Youâ€™re even able to team up with your friends to create amazing things together: in Scrap Mechanic, youâ€™re the master creator of anything you can imagine!\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s the deal: youâ€™re a robot maintenance mechanic en route to your posting on a fully-automated agriculture planet. Your job is to take care of the worker robots as they work the land, sending the food they produce to the metropolitan planets. Thing is, close to touchdown your spacecraft loses control and crashes, but since youâ€™ve got luck on your side (ermâ€¦), you survive! Youâ€™re stranded though, and at first glance you find that not everythingâ€™s quite as it should be. The Farmbots working the fields have gone crazy, and now thereâ€™s only one way to stay alive: using your quick thinking, your creativity and your wily knack of turning your surroundings to your advantage. \r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n\r\nMinimum:\r\nOS: Microsoft Windows XP (latest SP)\r\nProcessor: 2.6 GHz Dual Core\r\nMemory: 4 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce 8800GT / ATI Radeon HD 3870 or better OpenGL 3.3 compatible\r\nNetwork: Broadband Internet connection\r\nStorage: 2 GB available space \r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\nAdded a new glass block \r\nAdded new window parts \r\nUpdated Totebot Head: Blip, Bass and Synth Voice so they can play long notes. \r\nAdded a volume slider to the Totebot Heads. \r\nFixed near clip plane issues.\r\n\r\n**INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:\r\n\r\nOpen Scrap Mechanic.exe , wait for a bit for the self extractor to open, specify the directory where u want to extract the game folder, open the extracted folder and play.....\r\nOR\r\nExtract it yourself using 'WinRAR'\r\n\r\nAlways open the game using run as administrator\r\n\r\nCheck my FB page for more :\r\nMr DJ repacks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef7b6c02f745385c609586651a872093c0c781bc","amp;dn":"Scrap+Mechanic+version+0.1.25+repack+Mr+DJ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef7b6c02f745385c609586651a872093c0c781bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,123,108,2,247,69,56,92,96,149,134,101,26,135,32,147,192,199,129,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
