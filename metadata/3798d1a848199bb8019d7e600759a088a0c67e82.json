Calling upon accounts of political intrigue and tales of life and death, author Simon Singh tells history's most fascinating story of deception and cunning: the science of cryptography--the encoding and decoding of private information.\nBased on The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography, this version has been abridged and slightly simplified for a younger audience. None of the appeal for curious problem-solving minds has been lost, though. From Julius Caesar to the 10th-century Arabs; from Mary Queen of Scots to &quot;Alice and Bob&quot;; from the Germans' Enigma machine to the Navajo code talkers in World War II, Singh traces the use of code to protect--and betray--secrecy. Moving right into the present, he describes how the Information Age has provided a whole new set of challenges for cryptographers. How private are your e-mail communications? How secure is sending your credit card information over the Internet? And how much secrecy will the government tolerate? Complex but highly accessible, The Code Book will make readers see the past--and the future--in a whole new light.\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3798d1a848199bb8019d7e600759a088a0c67e82","amp;dn":"The+Code+Book%3A+How+to+Make+It%2C+Break+It%2C+Hack+It%2C+Crack+It+-Mant","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3798d1a848199bb8019d7e600759a088a0c67e82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,152,209,168,72,25,155,184,1,157,126,96,7,89,160,136,160,198,126,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
