It was released on 10 September 2010. The song peaked at number one in Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland and Austria. It became a top ten hit in Australia, France, \nGermany, Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, and the UK.\n\n&quot;Barbra Streisand&quot; is named after the singer of the same name, and samples &quot;Gotta Go Home&quot; (1979) by German disco group Boney M., which in turn borrows content from &quot;Hallo Bimmelbahn&quot; (1973) performed by German band Nighttrain, as written by brothers Heinz and JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rgen Huth. The single's album artwork is modelled directly after Streisand's own 1980 album, Guilty, which features a picture of her and Barry Gibb on the sleeve. For the &quot;Barbra Streisand&quot; cover, Streisand and Gibb's faces are digitally removed and replaced with duck beaks. The song was first played at the 2010 Miami Winter Music Conference.\n\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbra_Streisand_(song)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:962a420a7c36583b697be9e72a3bae5944a1d717","amp;dn":"Duck+Sauce+-+Barbra+Streisand","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"962a420a7c36583b697be9e72a3bae5944a1d717","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,42,66,10,124,54,88,59,105,123,233,231,42,59,174,89,68,161,215,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
