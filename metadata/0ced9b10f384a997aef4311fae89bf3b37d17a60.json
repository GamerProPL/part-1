He was born a slave at Hierapolis, Phrygia, and lived in Rome until his banishment, when he went to Nicopolis in northwestern Greece for the rest of his life.  His teachings were written down and published by his pupil Arrian in his DISCOURSES.  Arrian also compiled a popular digest, entitled the &quot;Encheiridion&quot;, or HANDBOOK, a short manual of Stoic ethical advice and compilation of practical precepts.\n\nPhilosophy, Epictetus taught, is a way of life and not just a theoretical discipline.  To Epictetus, all external events are determined by fate, and are thus beyond our control; we should accept whatever happens calmly and dispassionately.  However, individuals are responsible for their own actions, which they can examine and control through rigorous self-discipline.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB and/or PDF format as noted:\n\n* DISCOURSES AND SELECTED WRITINGS (Penguin Classics, 2008).
