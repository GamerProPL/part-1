But no. Or at least, it's not only about the food. The cuisine of this teeming archipelago of 3000 islands is a living part of its culture.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, it's believed that food should be devoured with all five senses: not just smell, taste and sight, but also touch (the texture of the ingredients, the smooth warmth of bamboo chopsticks), and even sound (a high-end ryotei is oddly quiet, the better to appreciate the experience of eating).\r\n\r\nAny Japanese meal - from a simple home-cooked fare to the most structured, formal kaiseki - aims to blend each of these elements for balance and nutrition. Unsurprisingly, this provides myriad benefits for our health, as does the act of lingering over our food and cherishing each mouthful with all our senses - the latter has been proven to aid digestion and portion control. It's clear that meals taken the traditional Japanese way are good for us. That they are such a pleasure to consume, too? Well, that's just a happy coincidence.\r\n\r\nWith sumptuous, original photography and inside stories and tips from Japan's best local cooks of the history, legend, emotion, and process behind each recipe, From the Source - Japan represents global food at its most thrilling. The perfect book for foodies and travel enthusiasts alike!\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/shtihl22\r\n\r\n=======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9036d251ccf22d81a415aa9dda2ef4ad9567a3d","amp;dn":"From+the+Source%2C+Japan+-+Authentic+Recipes+from+the+People+that+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9036d251ccf22d81a415aa9dda2ef4ad9567a3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,3,109,37,28,207,34,216,26,65,90,169,221,162,239,74,217,86,122,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
