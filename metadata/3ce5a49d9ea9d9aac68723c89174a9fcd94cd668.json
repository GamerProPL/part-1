The triple-disc Chess box remained in print, but they added two single-disc collections that each covered a specific period in Waters' career at Chess. Then, in 2001, MCA/Chess released The Anthology, a double-disc set that essentially contained much of those two single-disc collections, with several extra tracks, remastering and new liner notes. This still didn't correct the lack of a concise, single-disc overview with all the hits -- something that Muddy, Chuck Berry, and Howlin' Wolf all desperately need -- but if you're going to be buying two discs to get the full Muddy Waters story, you should get this instead of two separate discs, since it's simply easier. Besides this, even if it does contain a bunch of familiar material, it also contains some of the greatest music of the 20th century, and if you're not going to get the box but still want a comprehensive Muddy set, this is it. \n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc7qx3dUdE1qeg7d6o1_cover.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc7qx3dUdE1qeg7d6o1_cover.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\nGypsy Woman\nI Can't Be Satisfied\nI Feel Like Going Home\nTrain Fare Home Blues\nMean Red Spider\nStandin' Here Tremblin'\nYou Gonna Need My Help\nLittle Geneva\nRollin' And Tumblin' Part 1\nRollin' Stone\nWalkin' Blues\nLouisiana Blues\nLong Distance Call\nHoney Bee\nCountry Boy\nShe Moves Me\nStill A Fool\nStuff You Gotta Watch\nWho's Gonna Be Your Sweet Man When I'm Gone?\nStandin' Around Cryin'\nBaby Please Don't Go\n(I'm Your) Hoochie Coochie Man\nI Just Want To Make Love To You\nI'm Ready\nYoung Fashioned Ways\nI Want To Be Loved\n\nDisco 2\n\nMy Eyes (Keep Me In Trouble)\nMannish Boy\nSugar Sweet\nTrouble No More\nForty Days And Forty Nights\nJust To Be With You\nDon't Go No Farther\nDiamonds At Your Feet\nI Love The Life I Live, I Live The Life I Love\nGot My Mojo Working\nRock Me\nLook What You've Done\nShe's Nineteen Years Old\nClose To You\nWalking Thru The Park\nTake The Bitter With The Sweet\nI Feel So Good (Live)\nYou Shook Me\nMy Home Is In The Delta\nGood Morning Little School Girl\nThe Same Thing\nYou Can't Lose What You Ain't Never Had\nAll Aboard (Fathers &amp; Sons)\nCan't Get No Grindin'","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ce5a49d9ea9d9aac68723c89174a9fcd94cd668","amp;dn":"Muddy+Waters+-+The+Anthology+1947-1972+%5BMp3+320+VBR%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ce5a49d9ea9d9aac68723c89174a9fcd94cd668","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,229,164,157,158,169,217,170,198,135,35,200,145,116,169,252,217,76,214,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
