If not this game, then at least SOMETHING by Capcom. Thanks.\nThis is my first torrent by the way.\nPLEASE SEED AS MUCH AS YOU DOWNLOAD!!!\nThe trackers included with this torrent is a collection that I have accumulated. Please feel free to copy and paste them into every torrent you download, as that will increase your chances of getting more seeds/peers, therefore increasing your download speed. ENJOY!!!\n===================================================================================\nDirectly from the retail box:\n\nDevil May Cry 4\n---------------\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nOS: Windows XP/Vista/7\nCPU: Intel Pentium 4 or higher\nRAM: 512MB for XP/ 1GB for Vista/7\nVideo:  VRAM 256MB or higher; GeForce 6600 or higher\n\nIncreased performance will be noticed on more powerful systems.\n\n===================================================================\n===================================================================\nNow what I have to say about it. F**K what the box's system requirements tell you.\nIn my honest opinion, this game would be COMPLETELY unplayayble on this type of\nsystem. I would recommend AT LEAST:\nOS: Vista/7\nCPU: Dual-Core, 2GHz\nRAM: 2GB DDR-2\nVideo: GeForce 8400 (NOT PCI, PCI-E highly recommended!!!!!!)\nSound: Creative Labs X-Fi\nController: Either a Playstation 2-type gamepad or XBOX 360 controller for PC. Though it is possible to play this with the mouse and keyboard, I highly recommend spending $25 for a decent gamepad.\n======================================================================================================================================\n======================================================================================================================================\n\nFor those of you wondering if a crack or serial or keygen or any of that is required, not at all.\nHowever, you DO need to have the disc in to play, so I would suggest either using Daemon Tools to\nmount it or burning this .iso onto a dual-layer DVD.\n======================================================================================================================================\n======================================================================================================================================\n\nI have included a 100% save file.\n\nIt goes into the following directory after you install the game:\n\nC:UsersYOUR ACCOUNT NAME HEREDocumentsCAPCOMDEVILMAYCRY4\n\nUpon a fresh installation, there should be no files there.\n\nI DID NOT CREATE THIS SAVE FILE. I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO OWNERSHIP OF THIS FILE. IT WAS GIVEN TO ME\nBY A FRIEND, WHO ALSO DID NOT CREATE THIS FILE. HE DOWNLOADED IT FROM GAMESPOT I THINK, SO WHOEVER\nSPENT THE TIME AND PUT FORTH THE AMAZING EFFORT TO UNLOCK EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME, MAD MAD PROPS!!!!\n=====================================================================================================================================================================================================\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n1) Use WinRAR to extract the .iso file to a directory of your choice.\n   OR\n   Mount the .iso using mounting program.\n   OR\n   Burn the .iso onto a dual-layer DVD.\n  (I have included a way to turn one dual-layer disk into 2 regualr DVD's.)\n  (I have included a No-DVD crack as well.)\n\n2) Install the game.\n\n3) Copy and Paste the 100% Save File into   C:UsersYOUR ACCOUNT NAME HEREDocumentsCAPCOMDEVILMAYCRY4\n\n4) Copy and Paste the No-DVD crack(s) into the main game folder, which is usually:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t32-bit OS = C:Program FilesCAPCOMDEVILMAYCRY4\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t64-bit OS = C:Program Files (x86)CAPCOMDEVILMAYCRY4\n\n5) Create a shortcut from the main game folder for DMC4Launcher.exe onto the Desktop.\n\n6) Double-click that shortcut and you should be good to go, with no DVD needed to play + 100% save file.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caa821db4206e8f570ddcabffc4551219b377759","amp;dn":"Devil+May+Cry+4+%2B+100+Save+%2B+No-DVD+Fix+%28No+Crack+Needed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caa821db4206e8f570ddcabffc4551219b377759","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,168,33,219,66,6,232,245,112,221,202,191,252,69,81,33,155,55,119,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
