The band is known for recording many concept albums. Although they were known mainly as a progressive metal band, their origins could be attributed to classic heavy metal and power metal, as expressed by their debut album, Sirens. The band has been inactive since the release of its last album in 2001, and have not performed live together since 2002, instead concentrating on their more commercially successful side-project, the Trans-Siberian Orchestra.\n\n\nAlbum List\n----------\n\n1983 - Sirens\n1984 - The Dungeons Are Calling\n1985 - Power of the Night\n1986 - Fight For The Rock\n1987 - Hal of the Mountain King\n1989 - Gutter Ballet\n1991 - &quot;Streets&quot; A Rock Opera\n1993 - Edge of Thorns\n1994 - Handful of Rain\n1995 - Dead Winter Dead\n1998 - Wake of Magellan\n2001 - Poets and Madmen","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1c589db691a36e8780fdce377b4fd32e9f40761","amp;dn":"Savatage+-+Complete+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1c589db691a36e8780fdce377b4fd32e9f40761","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,197,137,219,105,26,54,232,120,15,220,227,119,180,253,50,233,244,7,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
