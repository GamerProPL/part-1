Foster; Professor Toshio Kobayashi; Professor Nicholas Vaughan\n\nPublisher:Wiley\n\nProvides for the first time a large, unified knowledge base laying the foundation for advanced study and research in automotive engineering.\n\nThe Encyclopedia of Automotive Engineering provides for the first time a large, unified knowledge base laying the foundation for advanced study and in-depth research. Through extensive cross-referencing and search functionality it provides a gateway to detailed but scattered information on best industry practice, engendering a better understanding of interrelated concepts and techniques that cut across specialized areas of engineering. Beyond traditional automotive subjects the Encyclopedia addresses green technologies, the shift from mechanics to electronics, and the means to produce safer, more efficient vehicles within varying economic restraints worldwide.\n\nThe work comprises nine main parts: (1) Engines: Fundamentals (2) Engines: Design (3) Hybrid and Electric Powertrains (4) Transmission and Driveline (5) Chassis Systems (6) Electrical and Electronic Systems (7) Body Design (8) Materials and Manufacturing (9) Intelligent Transport Systems.\n\n    Authoritative coverage of the wide-ranging specialist topics encompassed by automotive engineering\n    An accessible point of reference for entry level engineers and students who require an understanding of the fundamentals of technologies outside of their own expertise or training\n    Invaluable guidance to more detailed texts and research findings in the technical literature\n    Developed in conjunction with FISITA, the umbrella organisation for the national automotive societies in 37 countries around the world and representing more than 185,000 automotive engineers\n    Available both as a fully searchable, updating online resource, and in a print edition (publishing January 2015) comprising six volumes and over 4000 pages \n\nAn essential resource for libraries and information centres in industry, research and training organizations, professional societies, government departments, and all relevant engineering departments in the academic sector. Readers/users will include: Professional engineers and technical staff in industry; senior undergraduate and postgraduate level students and researchers; educators and trainers; industry analysts and researchers.
