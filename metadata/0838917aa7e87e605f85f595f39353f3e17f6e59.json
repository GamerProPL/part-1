The Southern-flavored quartet from El Cerrito, Calif., turned out 17 hits in a 44-month stretch, nine of them in the Top 10, five of them in the Top 5. Fantasy Records is proud to present The Singles Collection, a two-CD, one-DVD box with a slip case, containing all of the band's U.S. singles -- 30 songs in all.\n\nTop 5 smashes like &quot;Bad Moon Rising,&quot; &quot;Green River,&quot; &quot;Down on the Corner,&quot; &quot;Travelin' Band,&quot; &quot;Who'll Stop the Rain,&quot; &quot;Run Through the Jungle,&quot; &quot;Up Around the Bend,&quot; &quot;Long As I Can See the Light&quot; and &quot;Lookin' Out My Back Door&quot; are joined by seldom-heard singles that never charted (&quot;Porterville&quot; and &quot;Call It Pretending&quot; on Fantasy's Scorpio subsidiary, and later singles &quot;Tearin' Up the Country&quot; and &quot;45 Revolutions Per Minute [Parts 1 &amp; 2].\n\nThe 30 songs, (which are presented in their original single mixes, many of them in mono --- are making their CD debut), housed on two CDs, will be joined by a DVD containing four never-before-available, long-pre-MTV music videos: &quot;I Heard it Through the Grapevine,&quot; &quot;Bootleg,&quot; &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; and &quot;Lookin' Out My Back Door.&quot; Also included in the package are a poster featuring the dozens of international single sleeves, and a 16-page booklet with liner notes by former Rolling Stone editor Ben Fong-Torres, who lived and wrote in the Bay Area during CCR's golden half-decade.\n\nCD1\n01.
