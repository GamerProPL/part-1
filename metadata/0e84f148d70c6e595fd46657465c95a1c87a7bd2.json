The group's history began in Birmingham, England with Ray Thomas (harmonica, vocals) and Mike Pinder (keyboards, vocals), who had played together in El Riot &amp; the Rebels and the Krew Cats. They began recruiting members of some of the best rival groups working in Birmingham, including Denny Laine (vocals, guitar), Graeme Edge (drums), and Clint Warwick (bass, vocals). The Moody Blues, as they came to be known, made their debut in Birmingham in May of 1964, and quickly earned the notice and later the services of manager Tony Secunda. A major tour was quickly booked, and the band landed an engagement at the Marquee Club, which resulted in a contract with England's Decca Records less than six months after their formation. The group's first single, &quot;Steal Your Heart Away,&quot; released in September of 1964, didn't touch thecharts. But their second single, &quot;Go Now,&quot; released in November of 1964 -- a cover of a nearly identical American single by R&amp;B singer Bessie Banks, heavily featuring Laine's mournful lead vocal -- fulfilled every expectation and more, reaching number one in England and earning them a berth in some of the nation's top performing venues (including the New Musical Express Poll Winners Concert, appearing with some of the top acts of the period); its number ten chart placement in America also earned them a place as a support act for the Beatles on one tour, and the release of a follow-up LP (Magnificent Moodies in England, Go Now in America) on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Go Now\n02.Tuesday Afternoon (Forever Afternoon)\n03.Nights In White Satin\n04.Ride My See Saw\n05.Voices In The Sky\n06.Question\n07.The Story In Your Eyes\n08.Isn't Life Strange\n09.I'm Just A Singer (In A Rock &amp; Roll Band)\n10.Blue Guitar\n11.Steppin' In A Slide Zone\n12.Forever Autumn\n13.The Voice\n14.Gemini Dream\n15.Blue World\n16.Your Wildest Dreams\n17.I Know You're Out There Somewhere\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e84f148d70c6e595fd46657465c95a1c87a7bd2","amp;dn":"The+Moody+Blues+-+The+Best+Of++%281997%29+Mp3+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e84f148d70c6e595fd46657465c95a1c87a7bd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,132,241,72,215,12,110,89,95,212,102,87,70,92,149,161,200,122,123,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
