Maverick craftsman Chris Gleason combines sound woodworking techniques with a hip designer's sensibility to unleash the limitless possibilities of the common skid. Inside you'll find inspired projects for rescuing and repurposing pallets. Some of his pieces celebrate the rough, edgy character of the material, while others are crafted as fine furniture. He shows how to construct both indoor and outdoor furniture in a variety of styles, along with other useful items such as a birdhouse, a toolbox, and even a ukulele.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/04EYKnm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/04EYKnm.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e66aada1acc8fa1be683b8bb220e8b0338b3441","amp;dn":"Wood+Pallet+Projects%3A+Cool+and+Easy-to-Make+Projects+for+the+Hom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e66aada1acc8fa1be683b8bb220e8b0338b3441","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,102,170,218,26,204,143,161,190,104,59,139,178,32,232,176,51,139,52,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
