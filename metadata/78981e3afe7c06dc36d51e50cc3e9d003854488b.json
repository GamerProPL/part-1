How many applications give you that kind of power in so little time?\n\nOmniPageÃ‚Â® DocuDirectÃ¢â€žÂ¢: Supports shared Microsoft Server environments\nOmniPage DocuDirect is the perfect low cost solution for occasional document scanning, conversion and document routing for small businesses or workgroups that share a scanning device. It allows you to get the most out of low volume scanning devices like some digital copiers, MFPs, and All-in-One devices that have limited document conversion and network document routing capability.\n\nOmniPage DocuDirect can be installed on a network server or shared computer that is connected to one of these devices and can automatically send converted files to a predefined destination, multiple destinations or on-demand to anyone, anywhere using barcode workflows created with the OmniPage Workflow Assistant.\n\nMost productive and accurate conversion to Searchable PDF\nPDF files are everywhere and can come from a variety of sources. They can include scanned pages, embedded images, and text based information. Some of these elements donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t include searchable text but it is not obvious to most people and therein lays the problem. Using a typical OCR process to create whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s known as a Searchable PDF is a solution but it only works on scanned PDF documents that have not been altered. Forcing an OCR process on text based PDF files will unintentionally destroy text elements in order to create a Searchable PDF format.\n\nTo solve the problem of creating Searchable PDFs from files on disk without damaging existing text elements we created the eDiscovery Assistant for searchable PDF in OmniPage.  This process intelligently analyzes PDF files of all kinds and determines only those PDF files, or pages in a PDF file that require an OCR process. We have migrated this very productive functionality into OmniPage DocuDirect so the process can be centrally located using a watched folder on a server and handled automatically.\n\nGo mobile and listen to documents with natural sounding speech\nOmniPage has been upgraded with NuanceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most sophisticated and naturally sounding speech so that you can comfortably listen to any document being read to you through your iPhone, iPad, Android or other mobile device that support MP3 audio files.\n\nRead your document on your favorite eBook reader \nOmniPage has been updated to support the popular ePub format that is compatible with popular eBook readers.  Now you can quickly convert documents and take them anywhere you go to be read with eBook applications on the Apple iPad, Android Tablets, Microsoft Surface, Nook Simple Touch, Nook Tablet, Sony Reader PRS-350/PRS-650/PRS-950, Kobo eReader, Kobo Touch and Kobo Arc.\n\nCreate reliable document archives with enhanced PDF/A support\nOmniPage is an ideal solution for creating searchable PDF documents for long term archival using the PDF/A format. OmniPage now offers new PDF/A output options such as PDF/A-2b and PDF/A-2u to support your document archival policies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78981e3afe7c06dc36d51e50cc3e9d003854488b","amp;dn":"OmniPage+Ultimate+19","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78981e3afe7c06dc36d51e50cc3e9d003854488b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,152,30,58,254,124,6,220,54,213,30,80,204,62,157,0,56,84,72,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
