To celebrate the 40th anniversary of Ya-YaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s!, ABKCO will release a remastered deluxe and super-deluxe edition of the live album, a three-disc/one-DVD box set complete with five unreleased songs from the MSG shows. Additionally, one disc in the set will be dedicated to the sets from the MSG showsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ two opening acts, B.B. King and Ike &amp; Tina Turner.\n\nGET YER YA-YA'S OUT! - recorded in 1969 over two nights at Madison Square Garden - is the last official live document of the Rolling Stones in their swaggering Sixties prime; it's also one of the greatest live albums of all time.\n\nThis three-disc remastered Ya-Ya's includes the original in all its gritty glory. Disc Two is a five-song EP from the same shows, with acoustic performances - Prodigal Son and You Gotta Move - from Richards (playing a resonator guitar) and Jagger. The third disc is an unexpected treat: blistering sets by openers B.B. King plus Ike and Tina Turner (doing an outrageously steamy take on Otis Redding's I've Been Loving You Too Long&quot;). And serious rock geeks will enjoy the final flourish.  \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDisc 1: Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!
