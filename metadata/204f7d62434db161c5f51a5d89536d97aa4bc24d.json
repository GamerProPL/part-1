It features new and revised end-of-chapter exercises, more engineering applications to help the reader learn this software tool in context, and a new section on object-oriented programming in MATLAB. MATLAB has become the standard software tool for solving scientific and engineering problems due to its powerful built-in functions and its ability to program.\r\n\r\nAssuming no knowledge of programming, this book guides the reader both programming and built-in functions to easily exploit MATLAB's extensive capabilities for tackling engineering problems. The book starts with programming concepts, such as variables, assignments, and selection statements, moves on to loops, and then solves problems using both the programming concept and the power of MATLAB. In-depth coverage is given to input/output, a topic fundamental to many engineering applications.\r\n\r\nPresents programming concepts and MATLAB built-in functions side-by-side\r\nOffers a systematic, step-by-step approach, building on concepts throughout the book and facilitating easier learning\r\nIncludes sections on common pitfalls and programming guidelines to direct students toward best practices\r\nCombines basic programming concepts, built-in functions, and advanced topics for problem solving with MATLAB to make this book uniquely suitable for a wide range of courses teaching or using MATLAB across the curriculum","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:204f7d62434db161c5f51a5d89536d97aa4bc24d","amp;dn":"Matlab+-+A+Practical+Introduction+to+Programming+and+Problem+Sol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"204f7d62434db161c5f51a5d89536d97aa4bc24d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,79,125,98,67,77,177,97,197,245,26,93,137,83,109,151,170,75,194,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
