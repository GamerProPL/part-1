The record is BeyoncÃ©'s second &quot;visual album&quot;, following her eponymous 2013 record. Unlike its predecessor, which featured individual music videos for each track, a one-hour film was aired on HBO to coincide with the release of Lemonade. The album encompasses genres including R&amp;B, pop, hip hop, blues, rock, soul, funk, and country. Streaming service Tidal described the Lemonade concept as &quot;every woman's journey of self-knowledge and healing.&quot;[5] It features guest vocals from James Blake, Kendrick Lamar, the Weeknd and Jack White.\r\n\r\nLemonade was made available for online streaming on April 23 through Tidal, which BeyoncÃ© co-owns, and released for paid purchase through the service the following day. It was later launched for purchase by track or album to Amazon Music and the iTunes Store on April 25 and at physical retailers May 6. The record was preceded by the release of the single &quot;Formation&quot; on February 6, 2016. On April 27, BeyoncÃ© embarked on the Formation World Tour to support the release.\r\n\r\nTracklisting:\r\n\r\n1. Pray You Catch Me\r\n2. Hold Up\r\n3. Don't Hurt Yourself (feat. Jack White)\r\n4.
