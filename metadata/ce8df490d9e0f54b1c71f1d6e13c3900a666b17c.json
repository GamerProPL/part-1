The 10,000 words in A Sentence Dictionary are therefore used in sentences skilfully written to make them interesting to students. A special feature is the use of a symbol to separate the meanings of a word, or its uses as different parts of speech. All words, including derivations, are listed alphabeti-cally, since not all users of a dictionary of this kind can be expected to know, for example, that to find the spelling of bought one has to look up buy.\nThe author is a teacher who has been dealing with pupils' written work in a variety of subjects for many years and has carried out a number of investigations into children's vocabularies and their spelling difficulties. Also he has observed how often children look up a word in their school dictionary and then have to ask the teacher what the explanation means.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s18.postimg.org/e7f8s5049/A_Sentence_Dictionary.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s18.postimg.org/e7f8s5049/A_Sentence_Dictionary.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce8df490d9e0f54b1c71f1d6e13c3900a666b17c","amp;dn":"A+Sentence+Dictionary+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce8df490d9e0f54b1c71f1d6e13c3900a666b17c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,141,244,144,217,224,245,75,28,113,241,214,225,60,57,0,166,102,177,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
