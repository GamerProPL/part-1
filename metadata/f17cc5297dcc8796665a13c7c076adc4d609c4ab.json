Another man\r\nhas confessed to the crime.\r\nAmos Decker, newly hired on an FBI special task force, takes an interest in Mars's case after\r\ndiscovering the striking similarities to his own life: Both men were talented football players with\r\npromising careers cut short by tragedy. Both men's families were brutally murdered. And in both\r\ncases, another suspect came forward, years after the killing, to confess to the crime. A suspect who\r\nmay or may not have been telling the truth.\r\nThe confession has the potential to make Melvin Mars--guilty or not--a free man. Who wants Mars\r\nout of prison? And why now?\r\nBut when a member of Decker's team disappears, it becomes clear that something much larger--and\r\nmore sinister--than just one convicted criminal's life hangs in the balance. Decker will need all of his\r\nextraordinary brainpower to stop an innocent man from being executed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f17cc5297dcc8796665a13c7c076adc4d609c4ab","amp;dn":"The+Last+Mile%2C+by+David+Baldacci","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f17cc5297dcc8796665a13c7c076adc4d609c4ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,124,197,41,125,204,135,150,102,90,19,199,192,118,173,196,214,9,196,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
