I went through a selection of 50 tracks taken from all different times of the band Bon Tracks And Brian. And I decided to make this and float it to you guys.\r\nI  know the original recording is not a sound board rip. I can hear the fans better than I want. But this is what it is if you want more from the source content tell me cause this is more than enough for me and the 50 was to much.\r\n\r\nTracklist \r\n\r\n01. Given  the Dog a Bone.mp3\r\n02.
