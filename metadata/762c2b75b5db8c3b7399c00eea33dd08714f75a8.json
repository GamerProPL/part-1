After starting his professional career as a music transcriptionist for Frank Zappa, Vai recorded and toured in Zappa's band for two years, from 1980 to 1982. The guitarist began a solo career in 1983 and has released 8 of his own solo albums since. Apart from his work with Frank Zappa, Vai has also recorded and toured with Public Image Ltd., Alcatrazz, David Lee Roth, and Whitesnake. Vai has been a regular touring member of the G3 Concert Tour which began in 1996. In 1999 Vai started his own record label, Favored Nations, intending to showcase, as Vai describes, &quot;...artists that have attained the highest performance level on their chosen instruments.&quot;\n\n.: Steve Vai :.\n\n[img]http://img821.imageshack.us/img821/9894/43906lg.jpg[/img]\n\n.: Albums :.\n\n1984 - Flex-Able\n1990 - Passion and Warfare\n1993 - Sex &amp; Religion\n1995 - Alien Love Secrets\n1996 - Fire Garden\n1998 - Flex-Able Leftovers\n1999 - The Ultra Zone\n2000 - The Seventh Song\n2001 - Alive in an Ultra World\n2001 - Live at the Astoria London\n2002 - The Elusive Light and Sound Vol. 1\n2005 - Real Illusions: Reflections","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:762c2b75b5db8c3b7399c00eea33dd08714f75a8","amp;dn":"Steve+Vai+-+Discography+1984-2005+%5BMp3+320+kbps%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"762c2b75b5db8c3b7399c00eea33dd08714f75a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,44,43,117,181,219,140,59,115,153,192,14,234,51,221,8,113,79,117,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
