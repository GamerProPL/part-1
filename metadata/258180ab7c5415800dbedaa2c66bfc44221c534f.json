Everitt\nChÃÂ°pmÃÂ°n &amp; HÃÂ°ll/ÃÂ¡RÃÂ¡ Press | 2004 | ISBN: 1584883693 9781584883692 | 339 pages | PDF \n\nThis Handbook clearly and concisely describes how to conduct univariate and multivariate statistical analyses using the latest release of SPSS. Each chapter addresses a different type of analytical procedure and applies it to real data sets, primarily, though not exclusively, from the social and behavioral sciences.\n\nThe authors briefly review the theoretical background of many of the techniques, but they set that material apart in boxes so that the presentation of the various analyses proceeds without interruption. Each chapter ends with exercises, some related to the data sets introduced in that chapter, others introducing additional data sets.\nResearchers and students alike will find this a convenient, self-contained route to using SPSS for effective data analysis.\n\nContents\nPreface\nDistributors\nChapter 1.
