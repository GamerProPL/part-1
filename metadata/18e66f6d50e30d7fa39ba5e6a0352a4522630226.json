His first album, We'll Build Them a Golden Bridge, was an electric folk record, setting the stage for the early Bowie comparisons that were certain to follow his particular vocal style. In 1998, Bejar added a rhythm section and took it into the studio for the first time. The resulting recording, City of Daughters, is a sparsely produced collection of catchy pop songs in which Bejar's increasingly obtuse lyrics really start to stand out.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nShape-shifting Canadian pop craftsman Daniel Bejar's ninth studio album under the Destroyer moniker added a whole lot of Bryan Ferry to a pot already boiling over with copious amounts of Bowie, Dylan, and T. Rex. Bejar's predilection for pairing Oscar Wilde-inspired, semi-apocalyptic witticisms with glam-kissed, minor-seventh retro pop remained intact, but where previous outings like This Night and Streethawk: A Seduction mined the '70s for inspiration, 2011's Kaputt utilizes '80s sophisti-pop, New Romantic, Northern soul, and straight-up adult contemporary to deliver a flawed but fascinating record. Like Goldfrapp's divisive, 2010 retro dance-pop tribute Head First, Kaputt is fully committed to its cause, wrapping everything up in a pristine, immaculately produced biosphere thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s filled to the brim with twinkling synths, soft rock drums, and enough wailing trumpets and saxophones to out-mellow Kenny G, David Sanborn, and Dave Koz combined. Ever the well-read, secretly pleased malcontent (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI write poetry for myselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), Bejar sounds more comfortable in this new disguise than he does on his more troubadour-oriented projects, as if producing the soundtrack for a discotheque with a capacity of one was his intention all along. His epic 11-minute, 2009 single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBay of Pigs,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which he described at the time as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œambient disco,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ could hardly serve as a more fitting conclusion to Kaputt, as it more than lives up to its creatorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s boast. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSuicide Demo for Kara Walker,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSong for America,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChinatown,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ all of which skillfully tread water between the urbane intellectualism of Donald Fagan and the quiet, technical nihilism of Talk Talk, differ very little from the remaining six cuts, which may cause fans of his more adventurous work some fits, but thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no denying their icy, coke-fueled 2:00 A.M. elegance. \n\n01.Chinatown\n02.Blue Eyes\n03.Savage Night At The Opera\n04.Suicide Demo For Kara Walker\n05.Poor In Love\n06.Kaputt\n07.Downtown\n08.Song For America\n09.Bay Of Pigs (Detail)\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18e66f6d50e30d7fa39ba5e6a0352a4522630226","amp;dn":"Destroyer+-+Kaputt+%282011%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18e66f6d50e30d7fa39ba5e6a0352a4522630226","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,230,111,109,80,227,13,127,163,155,165,230,160,53,42,69,34,99,2,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
