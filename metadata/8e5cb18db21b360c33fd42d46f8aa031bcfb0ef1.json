I also used 'Subtitle Edit 3.3.7' to create subs for episodes that were missing subtitles for signs/songs.\n\nThis includes both Seasons 1+2 of Fate Zero all 25 episodes, Dual Audio, 1920x1080 res., I also titled each episode properly and organized seasons 1+2 in seperate folders. I had to go ahead and create subs for signs/songs for a few episodes(Mine are the yellow/blue subs) but most episodes had subs(red subs are [UTW]'s).\n\nThis took alot of work and I am very happy I got this series finished it is a great series to watch. Before anybody asks: I will NOT be doing a 720p version or uploading just the english audio tracks, I know it is a large file to download, but this is the best video quality available(as well as the ONLY English Audio version out now). You have my full permission to take these files and do a 720p version yourself or upload all the English Audio files. Please be patient and try to seed at 1:1 and help keep this torrent alive, enjoy : )\n\nMy Future Releases on Nyaa:\n~Sword Art Online Part 4 1080p Dual Audio~whenever it is available\n~S.A.O Batch Torrent- with all episodes(making sure they all are titled, and have signs/songs sub files) all depends on how busy I am might not get to do this, but i'd like to.\n\nMy Future Releases on ADC:\n~One Piece : Movie 10 - Strong World DVD/Bluray Combo- Should be up 1st week in Nov.\n~One Piece Season 5 Voyage 4- Should be up near end of Nov.\n\nOther than those releases that is all I will be uploading for a while im sad to admit. I will be gone starting in December for 4-5months(Basic/Job Training for the U.S. Air Force) so during that time I will be very busy and not able to upload/download.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPS: Please seed and spread some love!\n\nregards,\n-jnx_r","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e5cb18db21b360c33fd42d46f8aa031bcfb0ef1","amp;dn":"Fate+Zero+Season+1%2B2+%5BDual+Audio%5D+%5BEng-Jap%5D+%5B1080p%5D+%5BChrisazter%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e5cb18db21b360c33fd42d46f8aa031bcfb0ef1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,92,177,141,178,27,54,12,51,253,66,212,111,138,160,49,188,251,14,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
