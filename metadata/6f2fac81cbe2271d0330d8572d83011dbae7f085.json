No problem, weâ€™ve got both covered. And Deep Freeze is also ready to protect your servers giving you 100% availability.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nâ€¢  Retain data across reboots by using the complementary Faronics Data Igloo, that allows you to redirect user profiles, folders, and registry keys to a Thawed drive.\r\nâ€¢  Easy deployment is available with two deployment options.
