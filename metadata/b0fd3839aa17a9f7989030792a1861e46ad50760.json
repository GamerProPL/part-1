The Chicago Tribune proclaimed that her work Ã¢â‚¬Å“draws you in and keeps you reading with the force of a pure but nasty addiction.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Gone GirlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s toxic mix of sharp-edged wit and deliciously chilling prose creates a nerve-fraying thriller that confounds you at every turn. \n   On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy DunneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when NickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the mediaÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as AmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fiercely doting parentsÃ¢â‚¬â€the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definitely bitterÃ¢â‚¬â€but is he really a killer? \n   As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet?\n   With her razor-sharp writing and trademark psychological insight, Gillian Flynn delivers a fast-paced, devilishly dark, and ingeniously plotted thriller that confirms her status as one of the hottest writers around.\n\nAudio CD\nPublisher: Random House Audio; Unabridged edition (July 24, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0385366752\nISBN-13: 978-0385366755\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
