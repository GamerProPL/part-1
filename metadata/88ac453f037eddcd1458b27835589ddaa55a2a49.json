In these essays, Chomsky redeems one of the most maligned ideologies, anarchism, and places it at the foundation of his political thinking. Chomsky's anarchism is distinctly optimistic and egalitarian. Moreover, it is a living, evolving tradition that is situated in a historical lineage; Chomsky's anarchism emphasizes the power of collective, rather than individualist, action.\n\nThe collection includes a revealing new introduction by journalist Nathan Schneider, who documented the Occupy movement for Harper's and The Nation, and who places Chomsky's ideas in the contemporary political moment. On Anarchism will be essential reading for a new generation of activists who are at the forefront of a resurgence of interest in anarchismÃ¢â‚¬â€and for anyone who struggles with what can be done to create a more just world.\nGenre: Non-Fiction, Ideologies\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88ac453f037eddcd1458b27835589ddaa55a2a49","amp;dn":"On+Anarchism+-+Chomsky%2C+Noam.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88ac453f037eddcd1458b27835589ddaa55a2a49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,172,69,63,3,126,221,205,20,88,178,120,53,88,157,218,165,90,42,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
