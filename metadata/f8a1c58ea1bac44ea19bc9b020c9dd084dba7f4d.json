Coming off like a jazzier extension of the Brand New Heavies' Heavy Rhyme Experience: Vol.1, Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1 brought together a diverse group of jazz cats both old-school and new, including Roy Ayers, Donald Byrd, Lonnie Liston Smith, Ronny Jordan, and Courtney Pine. \n\nGuru even enlisted the serene pipes of Carleen Anderson and N'Dea Davenport and acted as something of an international hip-hop ambassador when he flipped &quot;Le Bien, Le Mal&quot; with French mic pro MC Solaar. From the Blue Note-style cover art to the hepcat spoken-word intro, this package is pure hip-hop jazz music. \n\nAlthough retro by design (the packaging makes use of the classic Blue Note graphic style), and regressive in it's violation of hip-hop's &quot;maximum effect/minimum means&quot; law of production values, JAZZMATAZZ nonetheless opened up a space for a progressive interplay between hip-hop and jazz.\n\nJazz purists may wish to note that the grooves lean heavily toward the funkier 1970s era of jazz, and hardcore hip-hop heads my be turned off by the mellower musical stance. But then again, this is neither pure jazz nor hardcore hip-hop but rather an extension of the two. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack listing:\n\n   \n\n1. &quot;Introduction&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:20\n   \n2. &quot;Loungin'&quot; (with Donald Byrd on trumpet and piano) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:38\n   \n3. &quot;When You're Near&quot; (with N'Dea Davenport on vocals and Simon Law on keyboards) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02\n   \n4. &quot;Transit Ride&quot; (with Branford Marsalis on alto and soprano saxophone and Zachary Breaux on guitar) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n   \n5. &quot;No Time to Play&quot; (with Ronny Jordan on guitar and D.
