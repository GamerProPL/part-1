This is done through the following effort:\n\n\n1. Install a full version of Mac OS X 10.5\n(both Intel and PowerPC code)on a PowerPC based Mac\n \n2. Apply all updates available to Mac OS 10.5 as of released \n date of this package (MacOSX10.5.8)\n \n3. Stripping all Intel code from ALL libraries, binaries, etc\n(evenatthe Mach/BSDLayer)\n \n4. Resetting back to a core install \n (first time startup on next boot)\n \n5. Repackage contents into a compressed archive for distribution.\n \n \n \nThe end result is a faster, cleaner running Mac OS X 10.5.8 \nfor use on older PowerPC based Macintosh Systems that can be\nimaged over to any support PowerMac/Powerbook G4 or G5 system.\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a55e1ee8fb24b320410c116bebb2bb9abf87087e","amp;dn":"Mac+OS+X+10.5.8+PowerPC-ONLY+Restore+Image","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a55e1ee8fb24b320410c116bebb2bb9abf87087e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,94,30,232,251,36,179,32,65,12,17,107,235,178,187,154,191,135,8,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
