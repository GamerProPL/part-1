The rest of the movie is interspersed with Baker regularly telling Bulger that he's an idiot. This would be more problematic were it not for the fact that, with very few exceptions, Baker seems tirelessly hostile to everyone. No wonder his closest associates Ã¢â‚¬â€œ friends, family, band members Ã¢â‚¬â€œ struggle to find anything nice to say about him, with Jack Bruce's assessment that &quot;he's the best Ginger Baker in the world&quot; coming as close as it gets to a personal endorsement.\n\nOnly on the subject of his drumming is there agreement that he's a genius, which is fitting, since the sole quality that Baker appears to admire in others is &quot;time&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ natural rhythm, of which he has plenty. Tracing his anger back to the lost father who told him that his best friends were his fists, this portrait of the artist grapples with the thorny question of whether you have to like someone to love their music, to which the answer seems to be a resounding &quot;no&quot;.\n\nPrimitive animations bring the young Ginger to life, while ample archive footage (from concerts to newsreels to clips from the pop movie oddity Gonks Go Beat) covers his rise to fame and travels around the world; recording in Lagos, working with Fela Kuti and refining his polo skills Ã¢â‚¬â€œ his other real (incongruous) love. As for that whack across the nose, it's a bloody gift to Bulger Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an act of on-camera aggression that speaks volumes about his combative relationship with the fearsome Mr Baker.\n\nVideo 720 x 400 / 23.976 fps / 1249 kbps / Xvid\n\nAudio 192 kbps, 48.0 KHz, MP3\n\nDuration 1:32\n\nSeed to the Max por favor. . .\n\nSno","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52e27a250f0d2285556171afeb2368c70b66bad7","amp;dn":"Beware+Of+Mr.+Baker+-+Sno","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52e27a250f0d2285556171afeb2368c70b66bad7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,226,122,37,15,13,34,133,85,97,113,175,235,35,104,199,11,102,186,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
