( http://thepiratebay.se/tags )\n\n - To use the subtitles, if necessary, simply extract the .SUB file from the .RAR archive into the same folder. A free app. that will extract .RAR archives is 7-Zip from http://www.7-zip.org/\n \n - I seed using &quot;Initial Seeding&quot; which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for up to several days until there are enough other seeds.\n\n - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) Small-scale torrents of hard-to-find large files such as rare movies are more vulnerable to dying if everyone doesn't seed to 100% or higher. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a22ace758073a61b7b023d2c9ad5c8cdcc821b99","amp;dn":"The+Killing+%281956+-+Stanley+Kubrick%29.DVDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a22ace758073a61b7b023d2c9ad5c8cdcc821b99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,42,206,117,128,115,166,27,123,2,61,44,154,213,200,205,204,130,27,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
