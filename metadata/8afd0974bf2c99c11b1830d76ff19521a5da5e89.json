And even if it has a pretty hefty price, it could be one of the best investments you've ever made.\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\n\nTested And Working...\nScanned (With Kaspersky) And 100% Clean.\n\n(If You Found Something &quot;Un-Clean&quot; In Any Of My Torrents, Consider That It May Be A False Positive(Alert) And If you Are Sure Please Report It To Me So I Would Remove It)\n\n[Please Leave A Comment Confirming This Pack]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8afd0974bf2c99c11b1830d76ff19521a5da5e89","amp;dn":"Uniblue+DriverScanner+2013+%2B+Serials+%5BChattChitto+RG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8afd0974bf2c99c11b1830d76ff19521a5da5e89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,253,9,116,191,44,153,193,27,24,48,215,111,241,149,33,165,218,94,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
