It's true to me, true to my brand, true to Avicii.&quot; On Sept. 17, the 21-year-old DJ-producer widely known for his mega-hit &quot;Levels&quot; will release the aptly-titled &quot;#TRUE,&quot; his hotly anticipated freshman album. Avicii debuted selections from the album at Ultra Music Festival this past March, performing live alongside several collaborators including Aloe Blacc, Joakim Berg, and Audra Mae. The list of other supporting acts includes Nile Rodgers, Mac Davis, and Incubus' Mike Einziger -- not typical 'EDM' artists.\n\n \n\nTracklist:\n\n\n01. Avicii - Wake Me Up (Feat.
