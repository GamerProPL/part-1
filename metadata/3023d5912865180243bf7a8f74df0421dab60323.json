But Winfield's pleas went unheeded. Left on his own and with threats to his life, Private Winfield was himself drawn into the moral abyss, forced to make a split-second decision that would change his life forever.\n\nDirector: Dan Krauss\nStars: Adam Winfield, Christopher Winfield, Emma Winfield\nGenres: Documentary\nCountry: USA\nLanguage: English\n\n\nThe.Kill.Team.2013.DVDRip.x264-WiDE: \nREL.
