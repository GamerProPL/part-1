There are other words we can use (optimization, performance, speed), but it's all about making existing code run faster. Whether for desktop, mobile, or web apps, in this course you'll see how to identify pain points and measure them accurately, as well as view multiple approaches to improve the performance. Author Simon Allardice covers everything from &quot;quick fixes&quot; to more complex (but more accurate) algorithms.\n\nLearn to choose the right data types, understand the pitfalls of using high-level languages, and decide where to spend your time. Plus, see how the underlying memory management model may have more of an impact than you realize, and what performance issues you can expect working with databases and web services.\n\nTopics include:\n\nIdentifying problems in the code\nEmbracing constraints\nUsing code analysis tools to measure performance\nManaging memory\nManaging disk-based and network resources","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62860c87ed6cf74b06ee58ffeae41aca8bb549fc","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+Foundations+of+Programming%3A+Code+Efficiency","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62860c87ed6cf74b06ee58ffeae41aca8bb549fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,134,12,135,237,108,247,75,6,238,88,255,234,228,26,202,139,181,73,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
