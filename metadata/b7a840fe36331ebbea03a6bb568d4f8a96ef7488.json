The same goes for fantasy writers. Fantasy doesn't need to be all blood and whirling blades, but if a fantasy writer straps a broadsword to a character's side, it had better be drawn in anger, at some point.\nAbercrombie's accounts of fighting are incredibly well-done, fast paced and capturing the fear and confusion, along with the rage and bloody-minded delight of mastering an opponent. Yet, the violence in this book takes an emotional toll on those involved. Also, his accounts of magic are very good, not flashy but weird and disturbing.\n \nOne of the very first things Good Reads recommended me to was this book. Well this and Gardens of the Moon. I ignored both books until convinced otherwise by friends of mine. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/series/82425-the-first-law-world&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/series/82425-the-first-law-world&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\ngoogle sam2085 kickass to find my other torrents\n\nTo quicky convert between formats like MOBI, EPUB, AZW3, TXT or PDF\nuse http://calibre-ebook.com/download or http://www.online-convert.com/\n\nComment if you cannot find seeds!
