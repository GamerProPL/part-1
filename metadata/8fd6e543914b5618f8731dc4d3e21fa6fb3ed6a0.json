However, if you delete the .srt files, there will be no Subtitles at all.  Also, the audio in Episode 10 is a little off because it was off in the source I downloaded from.  This can be fixed by simply tapping the Ã¢â‚¬Å“JÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ key in VLC 3 or 4 times creating an audio delay of -150ms or -200 ms.  \n\n2nd NOTE: My Internet has been on and off as of late, and I do not have that great of upload speeds, so please be patient when downloading.  If there are no seeders, I should be back soon.\n\nMediainfo:\nGeneral\nComplete name                            :Hell.on.Wheels.S01E08.720p.HDTV.x264.MIKY\nFormat                                   : Matroska (mkv)\nFile size                                : 486 MiB (505MiB avg for the season)\nDuration                                 : 43mn 21s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 568 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nDuration                                 : 43mn 21s\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\n\nAudio\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nDuration                                 : 43mn 21s\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy, please seed, and comment!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fd6e543914b5618f8731dc4d3e21fa6fb3ed6a0","amp;dn":"Hell.on.Wheels.S01.Season.1.720p.HDTV.x264.MIKY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fd6e543914b5618f8731dc4d3e21fa6fb3ed6a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,214,229,67,145,75,86,24,248,115,29,196,211,226,31,166,251,62,214,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
