Starting with the eighth issue, the title received a back up feature. Under Snyder and Capullo, the series quickly became acclaimed among critics and fans alike, and was regularly amongst the top selling, if not, the top selling monthly title from month to month. The title would be considered the lynchpin of the Batman titles, spawning crossover events such as The Night of the Owls, Death of the Family and Zero Year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks goes to theProletariat for this release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf6f2616fde0d0c44c00244026353c65b675abb9","amp;dn":"Batman+%28New+52%29+00-33+%2B+Event+Tie-ins+%28theProletariat-Novus%29+%5BNV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf6f2616fde0d0c44c00244026353c65b675abb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,111,38,22,253,224,208,196,76,0,36,64,38,53,60,101,182,117,171,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
