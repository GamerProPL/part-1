Comprised of singer/guitarist Noddy Holder (born Neville Holder, June 15, 1946 in Walsall, West Midlands, England), guitarist Dave Hill (born April 4, 1946, in Fleet Castle, Devon, England), bassist Jimmy Lea (born June 14, 1949, Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England), and drummer Don Powell (born September 10, 1946, Bilston, West Midlands, England), the group originally formed in the spring of 1966 under the name the In-Be-Tweens, playing out regularly with a mixture of soul and rock tracks. But besides a lone obscure single, &quot;You Better Run&quot; (penned by future Runaways svengali Kim Fowley), the band never issued any other recordings. By the end of '60s, the group had changed their name to Ambrose Slade and signed on with the Fontana label. Soon after, the quartet hooked up with Animals bass player-turned-manager Chas Chandler (who had discovered Jimi Hendrix a few years prior), who promptly suggested the group shorten the name to just Slade and assume a &quot;skinhead&quot; look (Dr. Martin boots, shaved heads) as a gimmick.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Get Down &amp; Get With It\n02.Coz I Luv You\n03.Look Wot You Dun\n04.Take Me Bak 'Ome\n05.Mama Weer All Crazee Now\n06.Gudbuy T'Jane\n07.I Won't Let It 'Appen Agen\n08.Cum On Feel The Noize\n09.Skweeze Me Pleeze Me\n10.My Friend Stan\n11.Merry Xmas Everybody\n12.Everyday\n13.The Bangin' Man\n14.Far Far Away\n15.How Does It Feel\n16.Thanks For The Memory\n17.In For A Penny\n18.Let's Call It Quits\n19.Nobody's Fool\n20.L.A.
