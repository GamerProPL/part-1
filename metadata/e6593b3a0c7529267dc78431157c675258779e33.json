When they are not 'at work' they are living in a real life Dollhouse which gives the show the name. One of those mind-wiped humans, a young woman named Echo, is slowly starting to become aware of herself and what's going on - all the while somebody on the outside is trying to bring the Dollhouse down while getting closer to Echo - possibly not aware that she is one of the Dolls he is after.

And, I'm VERY happy that I did. The pilot left me looking forward to Friday all week long. And when the second episode did arrive, I'm not sure I took more than 5 breaths all hour. I was too busy taking in every little bit I could. And when it was over, I watched it again. \n\nIt does make me wonder why Fox would put it in a slot where it might get as many viewers as it could. But, I have no faith that if people just turn on their TV's they'll be hooked. I can't seem to turn it off. \n\nMy only complaint? It's not on 5 nights a week!\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6593b3a0c7529267dc78431157c675258779e33","amp;dn":"Dollhouse+-+Season+1+%26amp%3B+2+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6593b3a0c7529267dc78431157c675258779e33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,89,59,58,12,117,41,38,125,199,132,49,21,124,103,82,88,119,158,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
