Former backing vocalist Durga\nMcBroom said that the music came from a side project called &quot;The Big Spliff&quot;,\nrecorded at the Division Bell sessions, and added that Gilmour and Mason had done\nmore recent work. The music features Wright, but Waters is not involved\n\nGilmour described the record as follows: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Endless River has as its starting\npoint the music that came from the 1993 Division Bell sessions. We listened to\nover 20 hours of the three of us playing together and selected the music we\nwanted to work on for the new album. Over the last year weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve added new parts,\nre-recorded others and generally harnessed studio technology to make a 21st\ncentury Pink Floyd album. With Rick gone, and with him the chance of ever\ndoing it again, it feels right that these revisited and reworked tracks should\nbe made available as part of our repertoire.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nGilmour stated that The Endless River will be Pink Floyd's last album, saying:\n&quot;I think we have successfully commandeered the best of what there is ...\nIt's a shame, but this is the end.\n\n\nTrack List\n\n01 - Side 1, pt. 1: Things Left Unsaid\n02 - Side 1, pt. 2: It's What We Do\n03 - Side 1, pt. 3: Ebb and Flow\n04 - Side 2, pt. 1: Sum\n05 - Side 2, pt. 2: Skins\n06 - Side 2, pt. 3: Unsung\n07 - Side 2, pt. 4: Anisina\n08 - Side 3, pt. 1: The Lost Art of Conversation\n09 - Side 3, pt. 2: On Noodle Street\n10 - Side 3, pt. 3: Night Light\n11 - Side 3, pt. 4: Allons-y [1]\n12 - Side 3, pt. 5: Autumn '68\n13 - Side 3, pt. 6: Allons-y [2]\n14 - Side 3, pt. 7: Talkin' Hawkin'\n15 - Side 4, pt. 1: Calling\n16 - Side 4, pt. 2: Eyes to Pearls\n17 - Side 4, pt. 3: Surfacing\n18 - Side 4, pt. 4: Louder Than Words\n\n___________________________________\n\n19 - TBS9\n20 - TBS14\n21 - Nervana\n\n___________________________________\n\n22 - Video - Anisina\n23 - Video - Untitled\n24 - Video - Evrika [A]\n25 - Video - Nervana\n26 - Video - Allons-y\n27 - Video - Evrika [B]\n\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\n\nArtist / Group: Pink Floyd\nGenre: Progressive rock\nAlbum Release Year: Blu-ray + CD 2014\nNumber of Tracks: 27\nIncluded Artwork: Scans @ 600dpi\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Format: FLAC Lossless\nCodec Version: libFLAC 1.2.1\nEncoding Bit Rate: 4382 kbps (Average Bit Rate)\nEncoding Bit Rate [MP3]: 320 kbps [Constant Bit Rate]\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 + 6\nAudio Quality: 24bit / 96000 KHz + 16bit / 44000\nVideos: 24bit / 96000 KHz\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Source: Original Blu-ray Release M2TS\nConverter: DVD Audio Extractor\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\nIncluded Artwork: (Embedded Artwork Within FLAC Files)\nTag / Artwork Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\nAdditional Files: MD5, FFP, foo_dr and M3U\nTotal File Size: 9.39 GB (10,090,460,968 bytes)\nRipped and Encoded By: oneanight\nVery Big Thanks to: &lt;BSW&gt;\n\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1029a32a7683ead0e4ba84c70d31da4f827993f2","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+The+Endless+River+%5BDeluxe%5D+%5B2014%5D+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1029a32a7683ead0e4ba84c70d31da4f827993f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,41,163,42,118,131,234,208,228,186,132,199,13,49,218,79,130,121,147,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
