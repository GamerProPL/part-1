Born in Spijkenisse in 1988, he began playing the piano at age five, but after getting his hands on a copy of music-sequencing program Fruity Loops, he started to play around with samples and create his own songs. After discovering the Rotterdam club scene, he began performing short DJ sets before traveling to Crete to hone his craft, playing at various clubs over a five-month period. Returning to his native Holland, he signed to the independent Digidance label and released his debut single, &quot;Afrojack: In Your Face,&quot; before forming his own record company, Wall Recordings, scoring club hits with &quot;Math&quot; and &quot;Do My Dance.&quot; Following performances at dance festivals Tomorrowland and Sensation, and a collaboration on David Guetta's One Love album (&quot;Toyfriend&quot;), he was invited to remix the likes of Madonna's &quot;Revolver&quot; and Lady Gaga's &quot;Alejandro.&quot; In 2010, he teamed up with electro-pop vocalist Eva Simons on his first U.K. Top 40 hit, &quot;Take Over Control,&quot; and also released a rarities album, Lost and Found, featuring nine previously unreleased tracks, in the same year. In 2011 he collaborated with Miami rapper Pitbull for the hit single &quot;Give Me Everything&quot; and released his own hit track &quot;The Future.&quot; A 2012 tour of America was followed by the announcement that a new Afrojack album would be released in 2013.\n\n\nCodec................: LAME 3.98\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v1.1, ID3 v2.3\nCovers...............: Front\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
