Production-wise, the album is split evenly between booming, G-Funk nostalgia (prime cut Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Get LiftedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ features a slow, rolling, Warren G beat) and more contemporary, Wiz-friendly sounds (lead single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Young, Wild &amp; FreeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is polished, bright, sunshine material crafted by Bruno Mars and his crew, the Smeezingtons). Highly desirable names like Jake One, Drumma Boy, Exile, and Nottz fill the rest of the production credits, and while the material is light and redundant, anyone with a little hip-hop schooling should be prepared, and rightly assume, this is much more How High than Blackout! Snoop and Wiz offer a flashy, multi-generational alternative to Method and Red, and bouncing between their styles keeps this single-minded effort from being a bore. The target audience should think of it as a bag marked Ã¢â‚¬Å“regsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that comes with no organic flavor or transcendent buzz, but is easy to roll and surprisingly dank.\ntracks\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Smokin' On\n02.I Get Lifted\n03.You Can Put It In A Zag, I'mma Put It In A Blunt\n04.630\n05.Talent Show\n06.Let's Go Study\n07.Young, Wild &amp; Free\n08.OG\n09.French Inhale\n10.It Could Be Easy\n11.World Class\n12.That Good\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e312146b657c252a9ffc7050ea9486a10b34240","amp;dn":"Snoop+Dogg+%2B+Wiz+Khalifa+-+Mac+%2B+Devin+Go+To+High+School+%5B320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e312146b657c252a9ffc7050ea9486a10b34240","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,49,33,70,182,87,194,82,169,255,199,5,14,169,72,106,16,179,66,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
