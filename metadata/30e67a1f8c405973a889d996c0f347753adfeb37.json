The menacing Dr. Octopus has put NYC in crisis again, but the webslinger is older, wiser and more in command of his powers now. In keeping with the more in-control Spider-Man, the game's controls have been beefed up considerably to allow never-before-seen moves and amazing agility in a fully-explorable 3D world that takes the popular &quot;sandbox&quot; concept of games like Tony Hawk's Underground and GTA and allows Spidey to take on missions and challenges all across the city as he and his spider-senses see best. \n\n\nDo you missing a game? Write a comment with the game you want and I will try to upload that game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30e67a1f8c405973a889d996c0f347753adfeb37","amp;dn":"Spider-Man+2+%5BPS2%5D+%5BPAL%5D+%5BMULTI2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30e67a1f8c405973a889d996c0f347753adfeb37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,230,122,31,140,64,89,115,168,137,217,150,192,243,71,117,58,223,235,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
