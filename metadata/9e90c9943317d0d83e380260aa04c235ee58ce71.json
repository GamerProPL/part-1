From the first combat death to the fall of Saigon in 1975 -the voices of the fighting men are brought to the forefront through personal letters, diaries, tapes, and interviews. Pictures tell the story on another level. Hundreds of photographs fill these pages, including Pulitzer Prize winners and many photos never before published. Reproductions of pages from diaries and letters home, bring alive the human side of the war. Here is the Vietnam War as it happened, day by day. All the sights, sounds, and feelings of the soldiers, the medics, the pilots, the infantry, and the airborne troops. The bombings, the terror, the sleepless nights, the pulsing life of the streets, and the fleeting moments of peace","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e90c9943317d0d83e380260aa04c235ee58ce71","amp;dn":"The+Eyewitness+History+of+the+Vietnam+War%2C+1961-1975.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e90c9943317d0d83e380260aa04c235ee58ce71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,144,201,148,51,23,208,216,62,56,2,96,170,4,194,53,238,88,206,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
