Having covered vast musical ground with his previous albums, Follow The Sun is the familiar sound of Rudd's earlier work as an ambidextrous solo artist. His voice, his guitar and his message; carried along with gentle rhythms and musical textures.\n\nBeautifully organic and understated, Rudd's delivery of Follow The Sun is a reiteration of the song's theme that no matter what our religion or our blood lines are in this world, taking a moment or a breath, to respect and acknowledge the flow of energy around us, is vital nourishment for our own souls.\n\nFollow The Sun invites us to leave our own distractions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the congestion of thoughts that keep us locked in our minds every waking minute Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and to not let each day pass us by. To take notice and be thankful of the beauty of our great mother and our connection to her. That the most overlooked of things Ã¢â‚¬â€œ each day's sun and moon, the winds and the tides, the creatures that fill our skies and oceans... that these things are the truth. They are conduits of an ever-flowing energy that society teaches us as humans to disconnect from, when in fact they are the things we need to be connected to the most.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93b9057965edaa854c99eee7927942ef8ee23d4c","amp;dn":"Xavier+Rudd+-+Spirit+Bird+%5B2012%5D+%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93b9057965edaa854c99eee7927942ef8ee23d4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,185,5,121,101,237,170,133,76,153,238,231,146,121,66,239,142,226,61,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
