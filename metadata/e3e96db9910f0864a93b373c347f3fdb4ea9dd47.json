But I did add some extra trackers.\n\n\nTorrent Contents:\n==================\n\nKontakt Library\n\n\nInstallation:\n===============\n\nAdd the root folder of this torrent as a library to (cracked) Kontakt.\n\n\nProduct Info:\n==============\n\nVOXOS: Epic Virtual Choirs is a remarkable new virtual instrument containing a full epic choir, boys choir, soloists and individual choir legato sections.\n\n\nPowered by the industry-leading Kontakt Player engine, VOXOS contains world-renowned choirs and soloists with experience in recording for countless Hollywood films, trailers, video games and the concert stage. Recorded at the beautiful Bastyr Chapel, with its gorgeous acoustics, the choirs were captured with multiple microphone positions in 24bit/48k 5.1 surround. The result is a pristine tone that sounds great right out of the box. VOXOS contains over 35,000 samples, at an uncompressed size of 35GB.\n\nVOXOS is split up into three main sections:\n\nPhrase Builder\n\n- 30 Syllable Matrix Editor\n- Intuitive, performance-oriented scripting\n- Staccatos, Sustains, Shouts, Whispers\n- Dynamic morphing between dynamics\n- 4 Mic positions + Full Mix\n- Section contains over 16,000 samples\n\nLegato Sections\n\n- Sopranos (Ah, Oo, p to ff)\n- Altos (Ah, Oo, p to ff)\n- Tenors (Ah, Oo, p to ff)\n- Basses (Ah, Oo, p to ff)\n- Boys Choir (Ah, Oo, p to ff)\n- Solo Boy, Soprano and Alto\n- Real transition samples for all intervals\n- Innovative Voice Leading Engine (V.L.E.)\n- 4 Mic positions + Full Mix\n- Section alone contains 17,000 samples\n\nChoir FX\n\n- Trailer Risers\n- Shouts\n- Whispers\n- Grunts\n- Screams\n- Tonal Diatonic Clusters (pp to fff)\n- Atonal Clusters (pp to fff)\n- 1950?s Sandman Choir (bum bum)\n- Contains over 1,700 samples\n- 4 Mic positions + Full Mix\n\nPhrase Builder\n\nThe Phrase Builder is a powerful way of adding word syllables into a choir performance. VOXOS contains a 30 syllable selector matrix which allows you to quickly assemble multi-syllable phrases onto a grid. Each syllable will intelligently advance to the next syllable, based on your keyboard performance. If it's a sustain, the Phrase Builder can also connect one syllable over many notes, in a melismatic way.\n\nLegato Sections\n\nThe Legato Sections contains true legato performances of Sopranos, Altos, Tenors, Basses, Boys Choir, Solo Boy, Solo Soprano and Solo Alto. Cinesamples has methodically recorded the tens of thousands of intervalic leaps within the ranges of each section. Their custom Legato script instantly analyses the keyboard performance and plays the appropriate interval sample. The result is an instrument that allows you to play smooth and emotional legato lines.\n\nBuilt into Legato Sections is Cinesamples' innovative Voice Leading Engine (V.L.E.). The V.L.E. allows you to play a full keyboard patch of S, A, T, B choir with independently moving legato lines. The engine instantly analyses the chord structure and assigns each pitch to its own section of the choir. The result: a patch that is easy to play, with incredibly realistic results.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3e96db9910f0864a93b373c347f3fdb4ea9dd47","amp;dn":"Cinesamples+-+VOXOS+%5BKONTAKT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3e96db9910f0864a93b373c347f3fdb4ea9dd47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,233,109,185,145,15,8,100,169,59,55,60,52,127,63,219,78,169,221,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
