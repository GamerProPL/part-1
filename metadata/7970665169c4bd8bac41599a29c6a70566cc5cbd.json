They make bad choices about their marriages. They get divorced. And so many of them don't step out of their situation and really think about the consequences of what they're doing. This movie asks, 'Are you sure you want to do this?' It sends up a flag.&quot; (c) Lionsgate\n\n\nFull name: Temptation.Confession.Of.A.Marriage.Counselor.2013.720p.BDRip.SubRus-Tralisana.mkv\nFormat: Matroska\nFormat version: Version 2\nFile Size: 4.37 GB\nDuration: 1 hour 51 m\nOverall bit rate: 5620 kbit / s\nThe film's title: Temptation Confession Of A Marriage Counselor 2013\nEncoded date: UTC 2013-07-01 23:08:36\nWriting application: mkvmerge v5.5.0 ('Healer') built on Apr June 2012 21:43:24\nWriting library: libebml v1.2.3 + libmatroska v1.3.0\n\nvideo\nID 1\nFormat: AVC\nFormat / Info: Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;450d2c222d0509716b74&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nThe parameter format CABAC: Yes\nThe parameter format ReFrames: 5 frames\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration: 1 hour 51 m\nBitrate: 4110 kbit / s\nWidth: 1280 pixels\nHeight: 544 pixels\nAspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nFrame rate mode: Constant\nFrame rate: 23.976 frames / sec\nColor space: YUV\nSubsampling: 4:2:0\nBit Depth: 8 bits\nScan type: Progressive\nBits / (Pixel * Frame): 0.246\nStream size: 3.11 GB (71%)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7970665169c4bd8bac41599a29c6a70566cc5cbd","amp;dn":"Temptation%3A+Confession+Of+A+Marriage+Counselor+%28Tyler+Perry%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7970665169c4bd8bac41599a29c6a70566cc5cbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,112,102,81,105,196,189,139,172,65,89,154,41,198,167,5,102,204,92,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
