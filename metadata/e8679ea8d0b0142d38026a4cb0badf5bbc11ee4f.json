Here, Bryan Perrett gives an absorbing account of desert conflicts from the first century BC to more contemporary conflicts such as those in Iran and Iraq. As he demonstrates, acclimatization and familiarization with the day-to-day problems of desert life are vital not only to teach troops how to protect themselves and their equipment, but also to bring them to terms with the harsh environment. The desert does not compromise, and battles fought there result in total victory or total defeat, often at horrific cost. \r\n\r\nInitially released in 1988 by Patrick Stephens Limited, this re-issue marks a determination on the author's and the publisher's part to keep an esteemed publication in print","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8679ea8d0b0142d38026a4cb0badf5bbc11ee4f","amp;dn":"Desert+Warfare%3A+From+its+Roman+Origins+to+the+Gulf+Conflict","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8679ea8d0b0142d38026a4cb0badf5bbc11ee4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,103,158,168,208,176,20,45,56,2,106,76,176,186,223,91,188,17,238,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
