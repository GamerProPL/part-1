It's nearly empty: dry, with polluted water and poisoned soil. Dilapidated houses hold slackers and stoners. The town is virtually owned by Dirk, a heartless young meth dealer. In the midst of this lives Ray Tuckby, a naÃƒÂ¯f, unhappily married with a slothful son. The highlight of Ray's day is chatting with Nora, a clerk at the market. When Ray comes home early from work and finds his wife in bed with his brother, a few things start to change. Then he meets Merl, who's putting in a Chevron station, and Merl encourages Ray to dream. Can he? A recipe for meringue may hold one of the keys. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9dc6112099fabaf8f6fe8036c3a98c79a1aa5e4","amp;dn":"Just+Add+Water+%282008%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9dc6112099fabaf8f6fe8036c3a98c79a1aa5e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,220,97,18,9,159,171,175,143,111,232,3,108,58,152,199,154,26,165,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
