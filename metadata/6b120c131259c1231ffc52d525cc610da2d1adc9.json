The -400 series is the best selling model in the 747 family.The 747-400 is to be superseded by the Boeing 747-8 as the latest commercial model, which is scheduled to begin deliveries in 2010. The last 747-400 was delivered in December 2009.\n\nThe 747-400 was announced by Boeing Commercial Airplanes in October 1985. Compared to the 747-300 the 747-400 has 6 feet (1.8 m) wing tip extensions, 6 feet (1.8 m) winglets, and a glass cockpit, which dispensed with the need for a flight engineer. The 747-400 also improved on the -300 with an additional fuel tank in the horizontal stabilizer, engines with improved fuel efficiency and higher thrust, an all-new interior, revised fuselage/wing fairings and newer in-flight entertainment. Like the 747-300, the passenger version of the 747-400 has the stretched upper deck (SUD) as a standard feature. The SUD is almost twice as long as the original 747 upper deck. The SUD was previously offered as a retrofit and first appeared on two Japanese 747-100 SR models.[6] While the wingspan was increased, the overall weight of the wings was decreased due to the use of composites and aluminum alloys.\n\nThe first 747-400 was rolled out in January 1988 and flew for the first time on 29 April 1988. Certification was received on 10 January 1989 with Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 engines, 18 May 1989 with General Electric CF6-80C2s and 8 June 1989 with Rolls-Royce RB211-524Gs. The first 747-400 was delivered to Northwest Airlines on 26 January 1989, with service entry on 9 February.\n\nPMDG brings you the 747-400X for Microsoft Flight Simulator X!\n\nFly your favorite heavy airliner on the new Flight Sim Platform - the PMDG 747-400 / 747-400F Version X for FSX!\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nBuilt with technical input from Boeing and using the latest modeling techniques for FSX, the PMDG 747-400X -8i/F Product Model Extension adds the majestic new Boeing 747-8 variant to your existing PMDG 747-400X installation.\n\nThis high definition visual model raises the bar on large airliner modeling by showing the 747-8i and 747-8F in exquisite detail.
