Played out across more than      \n         20 missions, Men of War: Red Tide  allows  to  take      \n         command of the feared &quot;Black Coats,&quot;  the  nickname      \n         given to Soviet  Marines,  an  elite  combat  group      \n         specializing in engagements near the shoreline. The      \n         player  has  direct  control  of  new  game   units      \n         including the Black  Coats,  tanks,  self-propelled      \n         guns, armored trains, landing craft, artillery  and      \n         new enemy emplaced weapons to capture and use.
