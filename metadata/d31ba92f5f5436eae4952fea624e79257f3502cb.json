Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Bill Everett, with an unspecified amount of input from Jack Kirby,[1] the character first appeared in Daredevil #1 (April 1964).\n\nDaredevil is notable as being among the few superheroes with a disability, being blinded as a youth in a radioactive accident that also drastically heightened his remaining senses and gave him a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;radar-sense\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; allowing him to perceive his surroundings. His public identity is Matt Murdock, a successful attorney-at-law.\n\nAlthough Daredevil had been home to the work of many legendary comic-book artists ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ Everett, Kirby, Wally Wood, John Romita, Sr., and Gene Colan, among others ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ it is Frank Miller\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s influential tenure on the title in the late 1970s and early 1980s that is best remembered, cementing the character as a popular and individual part of the Marvel Universe.\n\nDaredevil is like the Batman of Marvel. Many may compare Batman with Captain America or even Iron Man, but I personally feel the dark genre of Daredevil comics resembles those of Batman. Perhaps darker then Batman. Maybe due to Frank Miller, who has worked on both first on Daredevil and later on Batman.\n\nDaredevil is here for you all to enjoy. Download it and also Seed it.Its a big torrent and I wont be seeding it for 24 hrs, but have patience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d31ba92f5f5436eae4952fea624e79257f3502cb","amp;dn":"Daredevil+v1+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d31ba92f5f5436eae4952fea624e79257f3502cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,27,169,47,95,84,54,234,228,149,47,234,98,78,121,37,127,53,2,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
