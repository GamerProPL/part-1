The current band line-up consists of Sonia Fernandez Velasco (vocals and clarinet), Arnaud Vial (guitar), Hugues Payen (violin), Camille ChapeliÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re (clarinet), Charles Delaporte (double bass) and Antoine Toustou (electronics and trombone). The group formed in 2005 after three of the band members were hired by a film production company to provide the soundtrack to silent pornographic movies.\n\nThe band's influences include Django Reinhardt, Vitalic, Lionel Hampton and Daft Punk. The band released their dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©but studio album, Caravan Palace, on the Wagram label in October 2008. The record charted in Switzerland, Belgium and France, where it reached a peak position of #11.\n\nI was surprised to find this was already not on TPB, but hopefully this will cross-seed with btjunkie and supply a number of ready seeds...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:584dd3bc5f0f7032231577d7b1251d1664c1fc04","amp;dn":"Caravan+Palace","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"584dd3bc5f0f7032231577d7b1251d1664c1fc04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,77,211,188,95,15,112,50,35,21,119,215,177,37,29,22,100,193,252,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
