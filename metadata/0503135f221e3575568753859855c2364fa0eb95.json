However, once dinner is over and the guests retire to the drawing room, they discover that the servants have gone away, and for some reason they cannot leave. There is no explanation why -- there are no locked doors or barred windows preventing them from going home - but the guests are convinced that they're stranded. Left to their own devices, they slowly but gradually degenerate into genteel savagery.\n\nThis film, constitutes the absolute surrealist masterpiece of all seasons. With unique virtuosity, Bunuel shows how easily a person makes his bonds and limits his freedom. Who are however these persons? They are those that made fortune without have worked never in their life or those, that with illegal ways acquired power and money. Naturally the one that puts unreal bonds in all the persons, with a view to check and dominate them, is the Church. The director accuse the high society and the Church and puts them to live as simple persons and they make things that they would never make. In this masterpiece Bunuel points out also the corruptness that exists in the society, which emanates from the Church and has expanded everywhere. It is not simply a film, it is a sociological approach of corrupted modern person.\n\nSee the Roger Ebert review for more\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i202.photobucket.com/albums/aa318/crasus_mulder_v2/1-19.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i202.photobucket.com/albums/aa318/crasus_mulder_v2/1-19.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i202.photobucket.com/albums/aa318/crasus_mulder_v2/4-18.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i202.photobucket.com/albums/aa318/crasus_mulder_v2/4-18.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i202.photobucket.com/albums/aa318/crasus_mulder_v2/6-18.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i202.photobucket.com/albums/aa318/crasus_mulder_v2/6-18.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i202.photobucket.com/albums/aa318/crasus_mulder_v2/7-18.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i202.photobucket.com/albums/aa318/crasus_mulder_v2/7-18.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i202.photobucket.com/albums/aa318/crasus_mulder_v2/9-18.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i202.photobucket.com/albums/aa318/crasus_mulder_v2/9-18.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i202.photobucket.com/albums/aa318/crasus_mulder_v2/10-17.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i202.photobucket.com/albums/aa318/crasus_mulder_v2/10-17.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----not my rip---------\n\n~~~~~~ El Angel Exterminador.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,563,252,736                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD 1.1.2 Final              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:33:18                \nFrame Count:....................................134208             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................640                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................480                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.333                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1840                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.250&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................384                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................1           \n\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
