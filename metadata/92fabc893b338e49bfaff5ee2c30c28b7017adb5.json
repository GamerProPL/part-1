You can allow or deny these connections, or define rules to handle future attempts automatically. Little Snitch reliably prevents your private data from being sent out to the Internet without your knowledge.\r\n\r\nWhat's new in version 3.6.1:\r\n- Fixed a bug which caused a kernel panic on some OS X El Capitan installations.\r\n- Fixed a bug related to iOS Simulator apps where tvOS apps in the simulator would not show connection alerts and would lead to a crash in Little Snitch Configuration and Network Monitor.\r\n- Fixed a bug which caused Until Quit rules to remain active after quitting the related application.\r\n\r\nMADE IN UKRAINE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92fabc893b338e49bfaff5ee2c30c28b7017adb5","amp;dn":"Little+Snitch+3.6.1+%5BMAC+OS+X%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92fabc893b338e49bfaff5ee2c30c28b7017adb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,250,188,137,59,51,142,73,191,175,245,238,44,48,194,139,112,23,173,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
