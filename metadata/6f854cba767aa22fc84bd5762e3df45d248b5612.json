The series is set in &quot;London Below&quot;, a magical realm coexisting with the more familiar London, referred to as &quot;London Above&quot;. \n\nRichard Mayhew leads an ordinary life in London when one day a girl named Door falls, injured, across his path. The next thing he knows, his life is gone and he's pulled into the fantastical world of London Below. Pursued by the murderous Messrs. Croup and Vandemar, Door and Richard with the help of Hunter and the Marquis de Carabas, attempt to find the Angel Islington, who knows the secret behind the murder of Door's family, and possibly a way for Richard to go home.\n\nThe visual look of the series has come in for some criticism. Although originally shot for film, the idea was abandoned for budget reasons. To some people, the series now looks old-fashioned, and perhaps unprofessional. Garish and unsubtle. Neil Gaiman however thought the loss of quality actually improved the appearance of London Below.\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : AVI\nFile size                        : 350 MiB\nDuration                         : 29mn 14s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1672 Kbps\nWriting application              : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode                      : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nBit rate                         : 1473 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 544 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.150\nStream size                      : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : AC-3\nMode extension                   : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID                         : 2000\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 40.1 MiB (11%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 80 ms (2.00 video frames)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 500 ms\n\n\n\nNB.
