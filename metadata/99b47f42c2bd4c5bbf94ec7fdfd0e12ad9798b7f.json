In this book, Matt Waters gives a detailed historical overview of the Achaemenid period while considering the manifold interpretive problems historians face in constructing and understanding its history.\r\n\r\nThis book offers a Persian perspective even when relying on Greek textual sources and archaeological evidence. Waters situates the story of the Achaemenid Persians in the context of their predecessors in the mid-first millennium BCE and through their successors after the Macedonian conquest, constructing a compelling narrative of how the empire retained its vitality for more than two hundred years (c. 550-330 BCE) and left a massive imprint on Middle Eastern as well as Greek and European history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99b47f42c2bd4c5bbf94ec7fdfd0e12ad9798b7f","amp;dn":"Ancient+Persia%3A+A+Concise+History+of+the+Achaemenid+Empire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99b47f42c2bd4c5bbf94ec7fdfd0e12ad9798b7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,180,127,66,194,189,76,91,191,148,236,127,223,208,225,42,217,121,139,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
