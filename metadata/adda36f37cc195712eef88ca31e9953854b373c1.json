You are a survivor from a space colonization effort gone awry, and you find yourself alone on the surface of a hostile alien planet. With nothing but the Raw Resources at your feet, the only hope for survival is to build your automated machines and factories from the ground up to produce the equipment and defenses needed for survival on this strange world. Apart from efficiently designing and maintaining your army of machines, you will need to protect your factory and yourself from the unfriendly alien hordes who seek to destroy your automatons and remove you from the planet. \r\n\r\n&lt;&lt;_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_&gt;&gt;\r\n\r\nRemember to Buy the Software you Like to Support the Developers.\r\nRemember to Seed the Torrents you Like to Support the Swarm.\r\n\r\n&lt;&lt;_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_~`~_&gt;&gt;\r\nRecent Changelog:\r\n\r\nVersion: 0.13.19\r\nDate: 26. 08. 2016\r\n  Bugfixes:\r\n    - Fixed that the Golem, Watch your step and doing it right didn't activate from steam cloud on new factorio installation.\r\n    - Fixed selection boxes of trains in specific situations.
