(Language can be changed in the third setup menu, read the .txt for further instructions)\nYou do not need a serial or crack for this one. \n\nThe Stetchkov Syndicate is NOT a hacked setup, but serial and cracks for both SWAT 4 v1.1. and TSS are included. Remember you need SWAT 4 installed to play!\n\nDue to the fact some people only need the original SWAT 4 v1.0. exe to patch to v1.1., I included it in this torrent, and can be downloaded seperately.\n\n\nFor clarification:\n\n*** I assume you all know how to use Daemon Tools or Alcohol or w/e, mount images with any version. ***\n\n\n1) Unrar and install Swat 4. (Don't forget to change language, serial included in txt file.)\n\n2) Do not start.\n\n3) Go to (By default) c:/program files/swat4/content and replace the swat4.exe crack with the original .exe found in the torrent. (The russian setup has a crack built in)\n\n4) Unrar expansion, mount and install. You need the original .exe in place to update to v1.1, in return needed to install expansion.\n\n5) Replace the original install file(s) with the crack(s) in the expansion/crack folder.\n\n6) If you haven't done so already, remove the temp folder where you unrar'd the images. The RAR files are slightly smaller in case you want to keep the game on your HD.\n\n7) Play!\n\n\n***In case you still get the Russian version, uninstall and try again. This bug has been reported before, but reinstallation usually works.***\n\n\n\nONLINE PLAY IS NOT SUPPORTED! However, you can go on LAN with your friends. If I'm not mistaken, you'll still need to have different CD-keys, so don't forget to pick diff ones. (Website: http://www.serials.ws)\n\nI very much regret reading that some users have CD-key issues. As of this moment, I can think of no other solution then searching the net for one that works for you.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nContents\n\n-------------------------------\n\nContents screenshot:   &lt;a href=&quot; http://bayimg.com/CaNJMaaBB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://bayimg.com/CaNJMaaBB&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n4 Files\n\n\nSize\n\nComplete torrent           :              1.24 GB         1.328.949.367 bytes\n\n\nFile 1             (SWAT 4):              677  MB           710.296.469 bytes\n\nFile 2          (Expansion):              588  MB           617.474.217 bytes\n\nFile 3  (Original EXE v1.0):              1.12 MB             1.177.850 bytes\n\nFile 4     (READ FIRST.txt):                 1 KB                   831 bytes\n\n\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\n[ Disclaimer ]\n\nI did not crack this game, and I'm not claiming I cracked it. \nI just removed all unwanted and obsolete materials from the original downloads,\nmade them work together, RAR'd, and put them into this torrent.\n\nMy torrents are ALWAYS ad/link, password, virus, trojan and worm-free.\nAll uploads are scanned by;\n\n- Norton 2009\n\n- Avast!
