It includes many new options to make it one of the most effective virus scanners on the market. It is still plagued by horrible slowdowns at times. Even things so simple as just typing an IM can be stopped for several seconds for some reason. If you can get passed the occasional slowdowns of your computer, the scanning functionality of AVG Anti-Virus 2015 is top of the line. With the rewrite of the scanning engine, AVG includes multi-processor support. Essential protection that wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get in your way!

It goes beyond simply detecting and removing viruses on your PC by blocking infected links as you browse, checking files before they're downloaded, and helping protect your personal data online and on your PC with enhanced privacy features. With 2015, we've improved our core engine and its accuracy, and included a new cloud-based detection method. And because we know that security is just as important as usability, AntiVirus 2015 features a revamped, easier-to-use design.\n\nWe've been hard at work optimizing our core engine to increase its detectionaccuracy. That includes better detection of screen-locker ransomware and improved scanning of all downloadable files to keep you safe from an exponentially expanding pool of threats.\n\nAnd when a new online threat breaks out and spreads, the key to keeping you protected is the speed with which we can react. Our new Outbreak Detection gives us the tools to act immediately and curtail their spread. With AntiVirus 2015, you don't have to wait until the next virus-definition package is ready to be protected: the moment we know a threat's there, you're covered.\n\nFinally, we believe security should be clean and simple to be effective, and we've put a lot of work in making sure AntiVirus 2015 is intuitive to use.
