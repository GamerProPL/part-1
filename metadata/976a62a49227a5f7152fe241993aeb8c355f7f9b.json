The movie was written by Paul Rudnick and directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, and many cast members from the original returned for the sequel, including Raul Julia, Anjelica Huston, Christopher Lloyd, and Christina Ricci. Compared to its predecessor, which retained something of the madcap approach of the 1960s sitcom, Values is played more for macabre laughs. As a result, the film was met with more critical praise, earning a 76% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, as opposed to its predecessor's 58%. This was Raul Julia's last movie to be released while he was still alive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:976a62a49227a5f7152fe241993aeb8c355f7f9b","amp;dn":"Addams+Family+Values+%281993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"976a62a49227a5f7152fe241993aeb8c355f7f9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,106,98,164,146,39,165,247,21,47,226,65,153,58,235,140,53,95,127,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
