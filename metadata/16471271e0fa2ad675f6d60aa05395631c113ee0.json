He'll be cycling from the Brecon Beacons to the summit of Snowdon; caving in the Ogof Ffynnon Ddu, the deepest cave system in the UK; and following the River Teifi, running and kayaking. \r\n\r\n1)  Extreme Cycling: Brecon Beacons to Snowdon \r\nRichard Parks has four grueling days of cycling from The Gap in the Brecon Beacons, to the summit of Snowdon as he attempts to create a new cycle route, the highest in Wales. Joining him for parts of his challenge are a Paralympian gold medalist, the &quot;Godmother of Mountain Biking&quot;, and the world downhill champion. Richard also gets up close to a creature he has long admired, the red kite (the national bird of Wales), as he powers his way to the summit of the largest mountain in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/96/Extreme-Wales-with-Parks-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d8/Extreme-Wales-with-Parks-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/85/Extreme-Wales-with-Parks-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fc/Extreme-Wales-with-Parks-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bb/Extreme-Wales-with-Parks-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/Extreme-Wales-with-Parks-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1c/Extreme-Wales-with-Parks-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/17/Extreme-Wales-with-Parks-Screen7.jpg\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video: Bitrate: CRF-22 (~2842 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 164 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 30 mins,\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 623 MB\r\n * Source: WebRip\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\nPart 3 Has No Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt5982906/episodes?ref_=tt_ov_epl","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16471271e0fa2ad675f6d60aa05395631c113ee0","amp;dn":"BBC+Extreme+Wales+with+Richard+Parks+1of3+Extreme+Cycling+720p+x","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16471271e0fa2ad675f6d60aa05395631c113ee0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,71,18,113,224,250,42,214,117,246,214,10,160,83,149,99,28,17,62,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
