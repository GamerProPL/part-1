In any case, there is a vindictive, accusatory tone to songs such as &quot;What Do You Want From Me&quot; and &quot;Poles Apart,&quot; and the overarching theme, from the album title to the graphics to the &quot;I-you&quot; pronouns in most of the lyrics, has to do with dichotomies and distinctions, with &quot;I&quot; always having the upper hand. Musically, Gilmour, Nick Mason, and Wright have largely turned the clock back to the pre-Dark Side of the Moon Floyd, with slow tempos, sustained keyboard chords, and guitar solos with a lot of echo.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:756a26271988c1adf388ce90ba4cbbd63901a7b4","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+The+Division+Bell+%282014%29+%5B24bit+FLAC%5D+5.1+Bluray","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"756a26271988c1adf388ce90ba4cbbd63901a7b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,106,38,39,25,136,193,173,243,136,206,144,186,76,187,214,57,1,167,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
