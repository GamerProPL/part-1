Keeping the new interns on their toes are: The fatherly chief of medicine, Dr. Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins); the abrasive, worldly Dr. Perry Cox (John McGinley), and the caring but slightly jaded nurse Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes). The hospital janitor (Neil Flynn) also never seems to miss an opportunity to harass his target.\n\nScrubs is filmed in a real-life hospital. It&amp;#039;s the North Hollywood Medical Center, which has gone under severe reconstruction to fit all the equipment and represent Sacred Heart Hospital. Interesting trivia: Sacred Heart was the name of the school that Christa Miller worked; in one episode Zach Braff accidentally calls the Janitor Neil Flynn, which is the actor&amp;#039;s real life name.\n\nThe Opening Theme Song:\n\n&quot;Superman&quot; performed by Lazlo Bane","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed79d5535c29668aea7a01d1b8c587e502379a66","amp;dn":"Scrubs+Season+5+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed79d5535c29668aea7a01d1b8c587e502379a66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,121,213,83,92,41,102,138,234,122,1,209,184,197,135,229,2,55,154,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
