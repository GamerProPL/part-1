The reasons for these questions are obvious. Karl is one of the best athletes to ever play the game of basketball, he is a perennial all star, one of the strongest athletes in professional sport, and he has, without a doubt, the best physique in the NBA. In addition to all these attributes his ability to control his 6'9&quot; 265lb body is legendary. Karl gives credit for much of his physical success to his solid work in the weight room, which consists of 70% dumbell training. It is the intent of this book to help you to reach your peak via the fastest, safest and most efficeint route - dumbell training. The benefits of, and best approaches to, dumbell training will be addressed in detail. In short, training with dumbells is an excellent route to good muscle balance and symmetry, thus a better physique, increases in muscle size and strength, and an improved overall body control.
