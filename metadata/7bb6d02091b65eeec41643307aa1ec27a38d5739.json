From groups whose awareness of genealogy spreads wide enough to openly acknowledge Gang of Four&amp;#039;s influence (Fugazi, Rage Against the Machine), to those not in touch with their ancestry enough to realize it (rap-metal, some indie rock) -- all have appropriated elements of their forefathers&amp;#039; trailblazing contribution. Its vaguely funky rhythmic twitch, its pungent, pointillistic guitar stoccados, and its spoken/shouted vocals have all been picked up by many. Lyrically, the album was apart from many of the day, and it still is. The band rants at revisionist history in &quot;Not Great Men&quot; (&quot;No weak men in the books at home&quot;), self-serving media and politicians in &quot;I Found That Essence Rare&quot; (&quot;The last thing they&amp;#039;ll ever do?/Act in your interest&quot;), and sexual politics in &quot;Damaged Goods&quot; (&quot;You said you&amp;#039;re cheap but you&amp;#039;re too much&quot;). Though the brilliance of the record thrives on the faster material -- especially the febrile first side -- a true highlight amongst highlights is the closing &quot;Anthrax,&quot; full of barely controlled feedback squalls and moans. It&amp;#039;s nearly psychedelic, something post-punk and new wave were never known for. With a slight death rattle and plodding bass rumble, Jon King equates love with disease and admits to feeling &quot;like a beetle on its back.&quot; In the background, Andy Gill speaks in monotone of why Gang of Four doesn&amp;#039;t do love songs. Subversive records of any ilk don&amp;#039;t get any stronger, influential, or exciting than this. (AMG).\n\n\n\n01. Ether                                                        \n02.
