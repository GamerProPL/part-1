Like Your Arsenal, the remastered CD of Vauxhall is packaged with a previously unreleased live concert performance.\nVauxhall and I was a very different animal than its predecessor. Since the release of Arsenal, the artist had suffered the loss of that albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s producer, Mick Ronson. He paired with producer Steve Lillywhite (U2, Big Country) for Vauxhall. Lillywhite crafted a spare, often acoustic aesthetic to match the dark, somber and introspective songs written by Morrissey with his collaborators Alain Whyte and Boz Boorer. Whyte and Boorer both contributed guitar to the LP and were joined byÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nonny Bridgwood on bass and Woodie Taylor on drums.  The result was a stripped-down, elegiac, less heavily guitar-oriented LP.\n\nParlophoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s press release describes it as follows: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Vauxhall and I signaled an acceptance of ageing amidst the tyranny of time, casting off the shackles of the past, with a will to embrace the future. Along the way the album visits a cast of characters, including, references to Brighton Rock Ã¢â‚¬â€œ gorgeous, exhilarating album opener Ã¢â‚¬ËœNow My Heart Is FullÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ those whom disregard all social conventions and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtake life at five times the average speedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Ã¢â‚¬ËœSpring-Heeled JimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) and rejected romantics (Ã¢â‚¬ËœBilly BuddÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ also a Herman Melville character). It also lays waste to ignorant and selfish tourist whom are Ã¢â‚¬Ëœjaded by stagnationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Lazy SunbathersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢), the unthinking and unquestioning (Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhy DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t You Find Out For YourselfÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ later covered by The Killers), and tackles the inevitable loss of innocence (Ã¢â‚¬ËœUsed To Be A Sweet BoyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢), amongst other inimitable themes.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nDespite the personal nature of the material, however, the artist scored an unexpected hit.  Lead single Ã¢â‚¬Å“The More You Ignore Me, the Closer I GetÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ became his only song Ã¢â‚¬â€œ either solo or with The Smiths Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S., where it reached No. 46.  It also reached No. 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. In his native United Kingdom, the track went all the way to No. 8, and was the artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only Top 10 of the decade.    The album itself was also a success.  In the U.S., it made the Top 20 of the Billboard 200; in the U.K., it became MorrisseyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second No. 1 album after his 1988 solo debut Viva Hate.\n\nThis twentieth-anniversary Definitive Master of Vauxhall and I has been freshly remastered by Bill Inglot.  The bonus CD presents Morrissey in concert circa on February 26, 1995 at LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.  The concertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fourteen tracks include five selections from Vauxhall, music from Your Arsenal, the non-LP single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Boxers,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a performance of the Henry Mancini/Johnny Mercer standard Ã¢â‚¬Å“Moon River.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba3b0ae13ae066de0e858e2f597ab528efdef44e","amp;dn":"Morrissey+%26ndash%3B+Vauxhall+and+I+%5B20th+Anniversary+Definitive+Ma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba3b0ae13ae066de0e858e2f597ab528efdef44e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,59,10,225,58,224,102,222,14,133,142,47,89,122,181,40,239,222,244,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
