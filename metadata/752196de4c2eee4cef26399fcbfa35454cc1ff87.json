Fundamental principles are covered, quantum theory presented, and special techniques developed for attacking realistic problems. The bookÃ‚Â¿s two-part coverage organizes topics under basic theory, and assembles an arsenal of approximation schemes with illustrative application.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:752196de4c2eee4cef26399fcbfa35454cc1ff87","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Quantum+Mechanics+%282nd+edition%29+by+David+J.Griff","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"752196de4c2eee4cef26399fcbfa35454cc1ff87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,33,150,222,76,46,238,76,239,38,57,159,203,250,53,69,76,193,255,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
