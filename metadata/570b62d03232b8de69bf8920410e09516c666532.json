Cracolice and Edward I. Peters\nCengage Learning | March 2009 | ISBN-10: 0495558478 | PDF | 816 pages | 32 mb\n\nIn INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY: AN ACTIVE LEARNING APPROACH, Cracolice and Peters use a question-and-answer format so readers can actively learn chemistry. This approach is reflected in three words of advice and encouragement that are repeated throughout the book: Learn It Now! Each chapter includes an Everyday Chemistry section that illustrates how chemistry is applied in daily life. The fourth edition integrates new features such as technological resources, coached problems, and enhanced art and photography, all of which dovetail with the authors' active learning approach.\n\nAbout the Authors\nMark S. Cracolice is professor of chemistry, department chair, and the director for the Center for Teaching Excellence at the University of Montana. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Oklahoma in 1994 under the supervision of Professor Michael R. Abraham. He also has served as an associate instructional specialist at the Chemistry Learning Center at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Dr. Cracolice specializes in chemical education and teaches freshman chemistry and graduate courses in chemical education.\nEd Peters received his B.S. from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1943 in Chemical Engineering and his M.S. from Northwestern University in 1947. He had a long and varied career. He worked as an engineer for the United States Navy and was employed as a chemistry teacher for various high schools and colleges in California. He retired in 1987. \n\nBRIEF CONTENTS\nContents Overview vii\n1 Introduction to Chemistry; Introduction to Active Learning 1\n2 Matter and Energy 19\n3 Measurement and Chemical Calculations 51\n4 Introduction to Gases 99\n5 Atomic Theory: The Nuclear Model of the Atom 123\n6 Chemical Nomenclature 145\n7 Chemical Formula Relationships 177\n8 Chemical Reactions 205\n9 Chemical Change 235\n10 Quantity Relationships in Chemical Reactions 271\n11 Atomic Theory: The Quantum Model of the Atom 309\n12 Chemical Bonding 343\n13 Structure and Shape 365\n14 The Ideal Gas Law and Its Applications 401\n15 Gases, Liquids, and Solids 429\n16 Solutions 469\n17 AcidÃ¢â‚¬â€œBase (ProtonÃ¢â‚¬â€œTransfer) Reactions 515\n18 Chemical Equilibrium 543\n19 OxidationÃ¢â‚¬â€œReduction (Redox) Reactions 583\n20 Nuclear Chemistry 609\n21 Organic Chemistry 637\n22 Biochemistry 683\nAppendix I Chemical Calculations 713\nAppendix II The SI System of Units 723\nAnswers 725\nGlossary 767\nIndex 779","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:570b62d03232b8de69bf8920410e09516c666532","amp;dn":"Introductory+Chemistry+-+An+Active+Learning+Approach+%284th+Ed%29%28gn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"570b62d03232b8de69bf8920410e09516c666532","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,11,98,208,50,50,184,222,105,191,137,32,65,14,9,81,108,102,101,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
