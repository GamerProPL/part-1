Nutrition for Elite Athletes provides a comprehensive overview of the latest research on the nutritional requirements of athletes at the top of their game.\r\n\r\nSince researchers, clinicians, and graduate students work with certain populations of athletes, such as endurance athletes, and not single nutrients or metabolic systems, this book arranges topics by 1) athletic population and 2) nutrition /exercise interactions that reach across athletic subâ€populations (such as recovery nutrition), instead of by nutrients or metabolic system.\r\n\r\nBringing together the contributions of well-known experts from around the world, the book identifies the nutritional needs of endurance athletes, strength power athletes, team sport athletes, and weight class/aesthetic sport athletes. In addition to coverage of recovery nutrition and energy balance, the book:\r\n\r\n* Reviews the foundations of energy metabolism\r\n* Considers dietary supplements, food safety, and drug/nutrient/exercise interactions\r\n* Examines hydration requirements for various types of athletes\r\n* Explores how vitamins and minerals impact performance\r\n\r\nThe book assumes an understanding of the terms discussed in introductory nutrition courses as well as an understanding of metabolic systems concepts taught in undergraduate nutrition and exercise physiology courses. By doing so, the authors are able to get right into detailing the nutritional needs of elite athletes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its appeal for dieticians, researchers, and clinicians working with elite athletes, this book is suitable for use as a textbook for upper-level exercise nutrition and metabolism courses","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b5583af8258552c825c3a46f8c68277afa72266","amp;dn":"Nutrition+for+Elite+Athletes+-+1st+Edition+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b5583af8258552c825c3a46f8c68277afa72266","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,85,131,175,130,88,85,44,130,92,58,70,248,198,130,119,175,167,34,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
