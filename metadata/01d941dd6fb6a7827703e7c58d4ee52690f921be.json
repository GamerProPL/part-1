Go here and see for yourself.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pixologic.com/zbrush/features/ZBrush4R6/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pixologic.com/zbrush/features/ZBrush4R6/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nZBrush 4R6 continues to improve and enhance ZBrush functionality by giving you access to an enriched toolset of new features which will increase your creativity and productivity. The new ZRemesher provides entirely rebuilt retopology system to give even better automated and user guided topology. There are also new brushes and functions to improve your workflow for both organic and hard surface sculpting.\n\nZRemesher\n\nZRemesher is the next evolution in our\nautomatic retopology solution. ZRemesher \u0003has\nbeen designed with an artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s point \u0003of view\nin mind. With a single click, \u0003ZRemesher\nproduces ideal new topology based on your\noriginal mesh.\n\nThe new functions in ZRemesher are smarter,\nable to analyze the curvature of your model\nwith the precision of a computer, but with\nthe subtlety of the human eye.\n\nAdd more polygons locally where needed,\nchanging their shape to create perfect\ntopology flow. As with most ZBrush tools,\n\u0003ZRemesher also lets you take control\nover the automatic process and give\nyour own guidance to the core\nalgorithms. It is easy to drive the flow\nof polygons with the help of curves. You\ncan also define where you wish to have\nmore or lower polygon density. You can\nperform local retopology to a specific\npart of your mesh while keeping a natural\nconnection with the support model.\n\nBy default, ZRemesher gives the Adaptive Size setting higher priority than the Target Polygon Count because of the Adaptive Density mode which is enabled by default.  But when this mode is disabeled, ZRemesher will adjust its topology calculations to give equal weight to your Target Polygon Count value. \n\nOther Additions\n\nThe new additions and improvements don't stop there! Here is a brief summary of other noteworthy new functions:\n\n    DynaMesh now preserves PolyGroups. This makes it so easy to do Panel or Group Looping on a DynaMesh after having used Mesh Insert or Mesh Fusion!\n    The Slice brushes now only operate on the curve position and won't propagate. What you see is now exactly what you get!\n    Group Front -- a new PolyGroup creation function -- detects all polygons which face the camera and assigns them to a single group. This tool will let you create special effects by using your point of view, such as deformation of only the parts of your model that are visible to the camera.\n\nNew Brushes\n \nZBrushÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful creative toolset is largely based on its brush system. With each release we add new brushes that can transform your way of working or simply make your daily sculpting easier. With ZBrush 4R6, we continue this long tradition.\n\nThe new Trim Curve brushes cut your models in a way that is very similar to the Clip brushes, but deletes the affected polygons rather than pushing them to the stroke line. And as you can imagine, these new brushes will be DynaMeshÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new best friends!\n\nCreating holes through a mesh has been possible since the introduction of DynaMesh and more recently enhanced with Mesh Fusion. Now ZBrush adds another option for this purpose with the Bridge Curve brush: select an opening, PolyGroup border or crease edge and connect it with another to generate a bridge of polygons. And because this new topology detection is so useful with the Frame Mesh feature, we went ahead and enabled it for all brushes that use curves. You will love it as much as we do!
