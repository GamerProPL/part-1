In 1999 producers Fredrik Thordendal of Meshuggah and Mattias Eklund of Toontrack Music decided to design a sample library for their own use. They called Tomas Haake drummer of Heavy Metal band Meshuggah to record the drum samples. The library was called Drumkit From Hell.\n\nLittle did they know that Drumkit From Hell was not only the first true multi sampled drum recording for use with a virtual instrument but that it would also be the start for Toontrack Music to become the worlds premier developer of software, audio and midi for virtual drum and percussion production, spawning groundbreaking products like dfh Superior, EZdrummer and Superior Drummer 2.0.\nIn the time since Toontrack recorded and released Drumkit From Hell our knowledge of sampling drums and designing software has improved vastly and weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve built a great following in all genres and with all kinds of users, but our core has always rested firmly on the foundation of those early recordings.\n\nIn order to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Drumkit From Hell we release The Metal Foundry SDX. The name has layers of meaning to us encompassing both the beginning, what has come from it and what lies in the future. The Foundry is a place where precious metals are forged and what was started back in 1999 with the Drumkit From Hell recording sessions turned out to be truly precious.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6347d6efb42f033d2aea90528dc90c8b3f7e0eb3","amp;dn":"Superior+Drummer+%2B+The+Metal+Foundry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6347d6efb42f033d2aea90528dc90c8b3f7e0eb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,71,214,239,180,47,3,61,42,234,144,82,141,201,12,139,63,126,14,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
