Poirot discovers that the diamond was bought for Arlena Marshall by Sir Horace Platt and Arlena is on her honeymoon with her husband and step-daughter on a tropical island hotel. He joins them on the island and finds that everybody else starts to hate Arlena for different reasons - refusing to do a stage show, stopping a book, and for having an open affair with Patrick Redfern, another guest, in full view of his shy wife. So it's only a matter of time before Arlena turns up dead, strangled and Poirot must find out who it is... \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ae65c27cd2074344c3f979a4cc8119004306da4","amp;dn":"Evil+Under+the+Sun+%281982%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ae65c27cd2074344c3f979a4cc8119004306da4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,230,92,39,205,32,116,52,76,63,151,154,76,200,17,144,4,48,109,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
