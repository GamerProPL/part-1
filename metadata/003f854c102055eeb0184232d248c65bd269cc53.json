Period. No other software product in the music industry even comes close to the selection, performance and overall sonic accuracy when it comes to creating guitar and bass tones with a computer. Now, that's a mighty big mouthful of brag, but a wise old country gentleman once told me, &quot;Hey, it ain't bragging if it's true.&quot; Here's how we back it up.\n\nNEW MODELS IN AMPLITUBE CUSTOM SHOP V3.9\n\n*The Orange OR50 head brings back those late '60s and early '70s beefy British rock crunch tones, yet cleans up nicely with a twist of your guitar's volume knob. It's a 50-watt all-tube model featuring a simple control layout: Preamp Gain, 3-band EQ, HF (high-frequency) Drive, and a Master Volume.\n\n*The Orange AD200 Bass Mark III offers straight up bass tone with simple controls and beautifully constructed bass response. The original amp was so good that for years it was the only bass amp Orange manufactured.\n\n*The Orange Dual Terror is a dual-channel amp features a &quot;Fat&quot; channel for ultra-warm rhythm and smooth-distorted lead tones, and the &quot;Tiny Terror&quot; channel, which dials in tones from clean to ear-crushing.\n\n*New Orange Bass Cabinets include the Orange OBC-410, the OBC-115 Single 15, and the OBC-810. Each cabinet model features a dual-mic section with blend controls and a room-ambience control with dual room mics for creating the perfect ultra-realistic recording space.\n\n*AmpliTube Custom Shop now includes the officially certified model of the versatile Carvin V3M guitar head, featuring 3-channel operation plus a global master control section. Channels 1 and 2 are identical lead channels, each with a 3-way drive switch, channel volume and 3-band EQ with an EQ &quot;X&quot; control for adjusting the mid-frequency point of the bass and treble controls. Channel 3 is the clean channel, with a 3-way drive control and the same EQ setup. The master section controls the overall volume, reverb and Boost levels. The IK model features a selectable power mode with 50W, 22W or 7W options.\n\n*Also new is the Carvin 2x12 V3M, the matching cabinet.\n\n================================================================================\nREQUIREMENTS\n================================================================================\nMac (32 and 64 bit)\nMinimum: 1.5 GHz Intel processor, 1 GB RAM, Mac OS X 10.5 or later\nNote: PPC CPU is no longer supported\n\n================================================================================\nINSTALLATION\n================================================================================\n1.
