Their most recent album, Vicious Delicious (2007; BNE), saw IM adding guitars into the mix. Vicious Delicious had an airy blend of Psychedelic rock, Heavy Metal, Trance and Electronica. Some songs such as Artillery even had Rap/Nu Metal influences.\n\nLegend Of The Black Shawarma is said to have a similiar sound, IM stating in a interview a few months back, that this album would be a combination of Progressive Metal and Psychedelic Trance.
