The album pays tribute to the late 1970s and early 1980s era of music in the United States, particularly the sound of Los Angeles recordings of the period. Daft Punk recorded the album largely using live instrumentation with session musicians, and limited the use of electronics to drum machines, a modular synthesizer and vintage vocoders. The album also features collaborations with Panda Bear, Julian Casablancas, Todd Edwards, DJ Falcon, Chilly Gonzales, Giorgio Moroder, Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams and Pharrell Williams. The album has received widespread critical acclaim.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - Give Life Back to Music\n02 - The Game of Love\n03 - Giorgio by Moroder\n04 - Within\n05 - Instant Crush (feat.
