This book, an improved edition of a Russian classic, teaches amateur chess players 45 extremely effective skills in a crystal-clear manner.\nQuite a few of the ideas presented here will surprise the reader, because they offer solutions for problems the club player is only subconsciously aware. How do you activate your rook pawn? How do you prevent your opponent from opening a file? How do you restrict the efficacy of your opponents pieces? Which rook belongs on the c-, d- or e-file? What is the best way to exchange a piece? How do you castle artificially?\nIn most cases the techniques are easy to understand and memorize. Bronznik and Terekhin do not burden the reader with deep analysis and only present those variations that are really necessary to get the point. There is a special training section at the end of the book where you can test your skills.\n\nAbout the Author\nUkrainian International Master Valeri Bronznik lives and works in Germany and has written a number of highly acclaimed books on chess, among which 1.d4-Beating the Guerillas.\n\nCONTENTS\nSymbols\nIntroduction\nChapter IÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Restricting the enemy pieces\nChapter IIÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Create breathing space for your pieces!\nChapter IIIÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â The clash between pawn formations\nChapter IVÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â The rook pawn Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an underrated fighter\nChapter VÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Techniques in the fight for an open file\nChapter VIÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Some aspects of piece exchanges\nChapter VIIÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Working with the king\nChapter VIIIÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Developing and activating pieces\nChapter IXÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Along the diagonals\nChapter XÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Other methods\nChapter XIÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Practical exercises\nSolutions to the exercises\nIndex of players\nIndex of Techniques\nOpenings and types of positions\nBibliography","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0cb4b9e2fe1ea6b78e58640636dc52fdba08a6e","amp;dn":"Techniques+of+Positional+Play+-+45+Practical+Methods+to+Gain+the","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0cb4b9e2fe1ea6b78e58640636dc52fdba08a6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,203,75,158,47,225,234,107,120,229,134,64,99,109,197,47,219,160,138,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
