For more than 900 years it has been kept--and sometimes concealed--in several places around the town. The story of the Norman invasion of England in 1066 is set out in this masterpiece, recounting the Battle of Hastings, culminating in a victory for William the Conqueror and the death of King Harold.\r\n\r\nAlthough barely half a metre wide, the tapestry is about 70 metres long, embroidered on a plain linen background in wools of red, yellow, gray, green, and blue. Here are men feasting on birds, drinking from ivory horns, hunting, going to church, and loading provisions onto a ship. Bridgeford posits &quot;the quest of this book is to unravel the millennial mysteries of the work, to investigate the true origin and meaning of it, to understand more about the characters who are named in it, and to gain a new insight into some of the darkest events of the Norman Conquest.&quot; The result is a fascinating study","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a477fbb21d500a6006fcf5419766896771856610","amp;dn":"1066%3A+The+Hidden+History+in+the+Bayeux+Tapestry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a477fbb21d500a6006fcf5419766896771856610","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,119,251,178,29,80,10,96,6,252,245,65,151,102,137,103,113,133,102,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
