Thinking they have the best of the bargain, they soon learn that the house comes with a stalker who seems able to enter through locked doors. Driven beyond endurance by the continual harassment, the screenwriter sets a trap to exact his revenge... The film consists of 'found' material from the screen writer's video diary which, after the events, has been assessed by the Somerset police. This is a true story. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc60f1e62936ce6c9856e932d1e36cf9d852784c","amp;dn":"House+Swap+%282010%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc60f1e62936ce6c9856e932d1e36cf9d852784c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,96,241,230,41,54,206,108,152,86,233,50,209,227,108,249,216,82,120,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
