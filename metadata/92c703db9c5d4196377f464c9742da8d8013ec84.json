Thus, the 8 tracks here, a mixture of Monk originals and standards, present the bop pianist at a career peak, documenting music that is both challenging and immediately accessible. Playing with his touring quartet, Monk makes each song his own, finding a typically quirky melody line within the romance of &quot;Body and Soul&quot; or the swing of &quot;Bright Mississippi.&quot; Tenor saxman Charles Rouse adds some soothing horn soloing, but it&amp;#039;s Monk&amp;#039;s bright, intuitive playing that makes this a late bop milestone. Timeless.\n\nPreview:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Monks-Dream-Thelonious-Monk/dp/B00006GO99/sr=1-1/qid=1171745924/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-2415187-6946029?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Monks-Dream-Thelonious-Monk/dp/B00006GO99/sr=1-1/qid=1171745924/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-2415187-6946029?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92c703db9c5d4196377f464c9742da8d8013ec84","amp;dn":"JAZZ+-+Thelonious+Monk+-+Monk%5C%27s+Dream+%281962%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92c703db9c5d4196377f464c9742da8d8013ec84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,199,3,219,156,93,65,150,55,127,70,76,151,66,218,141,128,19,236,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
