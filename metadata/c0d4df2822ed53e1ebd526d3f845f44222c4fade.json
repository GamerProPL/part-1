Jerusalem) was recorded in 1995 and released in its ur-form on Tee Pee Records in 2003.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Dopesmoker is an alternate version of Jerusalem that we felt our fans might enjoy. This early version, as yet unheard, contains a more dynamic recording and a heavier mix. So get high, crank it up and listen with open ears and mindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.
