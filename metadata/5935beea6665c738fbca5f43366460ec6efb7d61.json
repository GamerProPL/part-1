Even at its most basic Ã¢â‚¬â€ the muscular, traditionalist Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rock and RollÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ the album has a grand sense of drama, which is only deepened by Robert PlantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s burgeoning obsession with mythology, religion, and the occult. PlantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mysticism comes to a head on the eerie folk ballad Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Battle of Evermore,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a mandolin-driven song with haunting vocals from Sandy Denny, and on the epic Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stairway to Heaven.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Of all of ZeppelinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stairway to HeavenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the most famous, and not unjustly. Building from a simple fingerpicked acoustic guitar to a storming torrent of guitar riffs and solos, it encapsulates the entire album in one song. Which, of course, isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t discounting the rest of the album. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Going to CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best folk song, and the rockers are endlessly inventive, whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the complex, multi-layered Ã¢â‚¬Å“Black Dog,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the pounding hippie satire Ã¢â‚¬Å“Misty Mountain Hop,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or the funky riffs of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Four Sticks.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But the closer, Ã¢â‚¬Å“When the Levee Breaks,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the one song truly equal to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stairway,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ helping give IV the feeling of an epic. An apocalyptic slice of urban blues, Ã¢â‚¬Å“When the Levee BreaksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is as forceful and frightening as Zeppelin ever got, and its seismic rhythms and layered dynamics illustrate why none of their imitators could ever equal them.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5935beea6665c738fbca5f43366460ec6efb7d61","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+Led+Zeppelin+IV+2CD+%5BDeluxe+Edition%5D+%282014%29+FLAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5935beea6665c738fbca5f43366460ec6efb7d61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,53,190,234,102,101,199,56,251,202,95,67,54,100,96,236,110,251,125,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
