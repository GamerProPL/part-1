Beyond the division of Corsicans and Muslims in        \n           the prison (the Corsicans who with their guard                 \n           connections rule what happens in the prison), he has no        \n           known friends or enemies inside. He is just hoping to          \n           serve his time in peace and without incident, despite          \n           having no prospects once he's out of jail since he's           \n           illiterate and has no support outside of the prison. Due       \n           to logistics, the head of Corsican inmates, a sadistic         \n           mafioso named Csar Luciani, co-opts Malik as part of the      \n           Corsicans' activities, not only regarding what happens         \n           inside the prison, but also continued criminal activities      \n           outside. The innocent Malik has no idea what to do but         \n           cooperate. This move does not sit well with the other          \n           Corsicans, who only see Malik as a dirty Arab, and the         \n           Muslims who now mistrust him. But as time goes on, Malik       \n           works to save himself while in prison, while setting up        \n           his life post prison on his own terms. Both his demon and      \n           his salvation in prison is the specter of one of the           \n           first people he really got to know during his                  \n           incarceration.                                                 \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n           Tahar Rahim................ : ...........Malik El Djebena      \n           Niels Arestrup............. : ..............Csar Luciani      \n           Adel Bencherif............. : .......................Ryad      \n           Hichem Yacoubi............. : ......................Reyeb      \n           Reda Kateb................. : ......................Jordi      \n           Jean-Philippe Ricci........ : ....................Vettori      \n           Gilles Cohen............... : .......................Prof      \n           Antoine Basler............. : ....................Pilicci      \n           Lela Bekhti............... : ....................Djamila      \n           Pierre Leccia.............. : ..................Sampierro      \n           Foued Nassah............... : .....................Antaro      \n           Jean-Emmanuel Pagni........ : ......................Santi      \n           Frdric Graziani.......... : ..........Chef de dtention      \n           Slimane Dazi............... : ..................Lattrache      \n           Rabah Loucif............... : ..........L'avocat de Malik      \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                      \n                             \n                       \n         \n                                                                        \n                                                                            \n                                    Enjoy!
