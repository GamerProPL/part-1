During his career, Vandross sold over twenty-five million albums and won eight Grammy Awards including Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance four times. He won four Grammy Awards in 2004 including the Grammy Award for Song of the Year for the track &quot;Dance With My Father&quot;, co-written with Richard Marx.\nBorn on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City in the Smith Housing Project, Vandross began playing the piano at the age of three. He grew up in a musical family that moved to the Bronx when he was thirteen. His sister Patricia sang with vocal group The Crests who had a number two hit in 1958 with &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;, though she left the group before the recording. Vandross' father died of diabetes when Vandross was eight years old. \nLuther Vandross was in a high school group, Shades of Jade, that once played at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. He was also a member of a theater workshop, &quot;Listen My Brother&quot; who released the singles, &quot;Only Love Can Make a Better World&quot; and &quot;Listen My Brother&quot;, and appeared on the second and fifth episodes of Sesame Street in November 1969. \nVandross attended Western Michigan University for a year before dropping out to continue pursuing a career in music\nHis next recording credit was on an album by Roberta Flack in 1972. He was the founder of the first ever Patti LaBelle fan club. Luther also sang on Delores Hall's Hall-Mark album from 1973. He sang with her on the song &quot;Who's Gonna Make It Easier For Me&quot;, which he wrote. He also contributed another song, &quot;In This Lonely Hour&quot;. Having co-written &quot;Fascination&quot; for David Bowie's Young Americans, he went on to tour with him as a back-up vocalist in September 1974. Vandross wrote &quot;Everybody Rejoice for the 1975 Broadway musical The Wiz; also appearing as a choir member in the movie.\nVandross also sang backing vocals for Diana Ross, Roberta Flack, Carly Simon, Chaka Khan, Donna Summer, Bette Midler, Chic, Barbra Streisand, and David Bowie.\nBefore his breakthrough, Vandross was part of a singing quintet in the late '70s, consisting of former Shades of Jade members Anthony Hinton and Diane Sumler, Theresa V. Reed, and Christine Wiltshire, also called Luther, signed to Cotillion Records.[8][9] Although the singles &quot;It's Good for the Soul&quot;, &quot;Funky Music (Is a Part of Me)&quot;, and &quot;The Second Time Around&quot; were relatively successful, their two albums, the self-titled Luther (1976) and This Close to You (1977), didn't sell enough to make the charts. Vandross bought back the rights to these albums after the record label dropped the group, preventing their later re-release. Vandross also wrote and sang commercials jingles during the late 1970s and early 1980s, continued his successful career as a popular session singer during the late 1970s.\nLuther also sang lead vocals for a disco band called Greg Diamonds Bionic Boogie singing lead for the song titled Hot Butterfly.\nLuther Vandross finally made his long desired career breakthrough as a featured singer with the vaunted pop-dance act Change, a studio concept created by French-Italian businessman Jacques Fred Petrus. Their 1980 hits, &quot;A Lover's Holiday&quot; (by Romani and Willoughby), &quot;The Glow of Love&quot; (by Romani, Malavasi and Garfield) and &quot;Searching&quot; (by Malavasi), of which Vandross sang on all three, opened up the world for Vandross. And there was no doubt about whether Vandross liked the song &quot;The Glow of Love&quot;. In an interview that Vibe Magazine did with him in 2001 Vandross said, &quot;This is the most beautiful song I've ever sung in my life.&quot; Vandross was also originally intended to perform on the second and highly successful Change album &quot;Miracles&quot; in 1981, but declined the offer as Petrus didn't pay enough money. Vandross' decision rapidly led to a recording contract with Epic Records that same year but didn't stop him from doing some background vocals on &quot;Miracles&quot; and on the new Petrus created act, NYC band, The B. B. &amp; Q. band in 1981. During that hectic year Vandross jump-started his second attempt at a solo career with his debut album, Never Too Much. In addition to the hit title track it contained a version of the Burt Bacharach / Hal David song &quot;A House Is Not a Home&quot;. The song &quot;Never Too Much&quot;, written by himself, reaching number-one on the R&amp;B charts. This period also marked the beginning of frequent songwriting collaboration with bassist Marcus Miller, who played on many of the tracks and would also produce or co-produce a number of tracks for Vandross.\nVandross released a series of successful albums during the 1980s and continued his session work with guest vocals on groups like Charme in 1982. These albums earned him the reputation as &quot;the Black Phil Collins.&quot; Although the albums were successful overall, many of his earlier albums made a much bigger impact on the R&amp;B charts than on the pop charts. During the 1980s, Vandross had two singles that reached number one on the Billboard R&amp;B charts: &quot;Stop to Love&quot;, in 1986, and a duet with Gregory HinesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;There's Nothing Better Than Love.&quot;[10] He was at the helm for Aretha Franklin's albums Jump to It and Get It Right. In 1983, the opportunity to work with his main music influence, Dionne Warwick, came about with Vandross producing, writing songs, and singing on How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye, her fourth album for Arista Records. The title track duet reached #27 on the Hot 100 chart (#7 R&amp;B/#4 Adult Contemporary), while the second single, &quot;Got a Date&quot; was only a moderate  \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b205ca038a0b223169b6dbd26fc72927e9a3e7e","amp;dn":"Luther+Vandross+albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b205ca038a0b223169b6dbd26fc72927e9a3e7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,32,92,160,56,160,178,35,22,155,109,189,38,252,114,146,126,154,62,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
