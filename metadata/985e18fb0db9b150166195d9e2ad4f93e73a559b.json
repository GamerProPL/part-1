Even the imperial legions, long inured to the bloodshed, yearn for some respite. Yet Empress LaseenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rule remains absolute, enforced by her dreaded Claw assassins. For Sergeant Whiskeyjack and his squad of Bridgeburners, and for Tattersail, their lone surviving mage, the aftermath of the siege of Pale should have been a time to mourn the many dead. But Darujhistan, last of the Free Cities, yet holds out.\n\nDeadhouse Gates - In the vast dominion of Seven Cities, in the Holy Desert Raraku, the seer ShaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ik and her followers prepare for the long-prophesied uprising known as the Whirlwind. Unprecedented in size and savagery, this maelstrom of fanaticism and bloodlust will embroil the Malazan Empire in one of the bloodiest conflicts it has ever known, shaping destinies and giving birth to legends.....\n\nMemories of Ice - The ravaged continent of Genabackis has given birth to a terrifying new empire: the Pannion Domin. Like a tide of corrupted blood, it seethes across the land, devouring all. In its path stands an uneasy alliance: OnearmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s army and WhiskeyjackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bridgeburners alongside their enemies of old - the forces of the Warlord Caladan Brood, Anomander Rake and his Tiste Andii mages, and the Rhivi people of the plains. But ancient undead clans are also gathering; the TÃ¢â‚¬â„¢lan Imass have risen.\n\nHouse of Chains - In Northern Genabackis, a raiding party of savage tribal warriors descends from the mountains into the southern flatlands. Their intention is to wreak havoc amongst the despised lowlanders, but for the one named Karsa Orlong, it marks the beginning of what will prove to be an extraordinary destiny.\n\nMidnight Tides - After decades of internecine warfare, the tribes of the Tiste Edur have at last united under the Warlock King of the Hiroth. There is peace - but it has been exacted at a terrible price: a pact made with a hidden power whose motives are at best suspect, at worst, deadly. To the south, the expansionist kingdom of Lether, eager to fulfill its long-prophesized renaissance as an Empire reborn, has enslved all its less-civilized neighbors with rapacious hunger. All, that is, save one - the Tiste Edur. And it must be only a matter of time before they too fall.\n\nThe Bonehunters - The Seven Cities Rebellion has been crushed. ShaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ik is dead. One last rebel force remains, holed up in the city of YÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ghatan and under the fanatical command of Leoman of the Flails. The prospect of laying siege to this ancient fortress makes the battle-weary Malazan Fourteenth Army uneasy. For it was here that the EmpireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest champion, Dassem Ultor, was slain and a tide of Malazan blood spilled. A place of foreboding, its smell is of death. But elsewhere, agents of a far greater conflict have made their opening moves\n\nReaper's Gale - All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against their own people. The Errant, once a far-seeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace as the empire edges closer to all-out war with the neighboring kingdoms.\n\nToll the Hounds - In Darujhistan, the city of blue blue Ã¯Â¬ï¿½re, it is said that Love and Death shall arrive dancing. It is summer, and the heat is oppressive, but for the small, rotund man in the faded red waistcoat discomfiture is not just because of the sun. All is not well. Dire portents plague his nights and haunt the city streets like Ã¯Â¬ï¿½ends of shadow. Assassins skulk in alleyways, but the quarry has turned, and the hunters become the hunted. Hidden hands pluck the strings of tyranny like a fell chorus.\n\nDust of Dreams - The fate awaiting the Bonehunters is one no soldier can prepare for, and one no mortal soul can withstand - the foe is uncertainty and the only weapon worth wielding is stubborn courage. In war everyone loses, and this brutal truth can be found in the eyes of every soldier in every world.\n\nThe Crippled God - Savaged by the K'Chain Nah'Ruk, the Bonehunters march for Kolanse, where waits an unknown fate. Tormented by questions, the army totters on the edge of mutiny, but Adjunct Tavore will not relent. One final act remains, if it is in her power, if she can hold her army together, if the shaky allegiances she has forged can survive all that is to come. A woman with no gifts of magic, deemed plain, unprepossessing, displaying nothing to instill loyalty or confidence, Tavore Paran of House Paran means to challenge the gods - if her own troops don't kill her first.\n\n\n\nRead by Ralph Lister, Michael Page\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged\n\nType: Unabridged\nNarrator: Ralph Lister &amp; Michael Page\nQuality: 64 kbps / 2.0 Stereo / 44100 hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:985e18fb0db9b150166195d9e2ad4f93e73a559b","amp;dn":"+Steven+Erikson+-+Malazan+Book+of+the+Fallen+%5B1-10%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"985e18fb0db9b150166195d9e2ad4f93e73a559b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,94,24,251,13,185,177,80,22,97,149,217,226,173,79,147,231,58,85,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
