Behind the wheel of the other car is Merry Mansfieldâ€“the eponymous Razor Girlâ€“and the crash scam is only the beginning of events that spiral crazily out of control while unleashing some of the wildest characters Hiaasen has ever set loose on the page. Thereâ€™s Trebeaux, the owner of Sedimental Journeysâ€“a company that steals sand from one beach to restore erosion on another . . . Dominick â€œBig Noogieâ€ Aeola, a NYC mafia capo with a taste for tropic-wear . . . Buck Nance, a Wisconsin accordionist who has rebranded himself as the star of a redneck reality show called Bayou Brethren . . . a street psycho known as Blister whoâ€™s more Buck Nance than Buck could ever be . . . Brock Richardson, a Miami product-liability lawyer whoâ€™s getting dangerouslyâ€“and deforminglyâ€“hooked on the very E.D. product heâ€™s litigating against . . . and Andrew Yancyâ€“formerly Detective Yancy, busted down to the Key West roach patrol after accosting his then-loverâ€™s husband with a Dust Buster. Yancy believes that if he can singlehandedly solve a high-profile murder, heâ€™ll get his detective badge back. That the Razor Girl may be the key to Yancyâ€™s future will be as surprising as anything else he encounters along the wayâ€“including the giant Gambian rats that are livening up his restaurant inspections.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23cb2b4dfa6e321ae7ee3ea71521c4dedf548e26","amp;dn":"Razor+Girl+-+Carl+Hiaasen+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23cb2b4dfa6e321ae7ee3ea71521c4dedf548e26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,203,43,77,250,110,50,26,231,238,62,167,21,33,196,222,223,84,142,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
