She             \n         rejects William, her suitor, because she         \n           considers his sexual advances inappropriate.       \n            One day while daydreaming a white rabbit             \n              taps her on the shoulder, and leads her            \n             to Wonderland, where she is introduced to          \n            her imagination and to pleasure. After           \n               encounters with the Queen of Hearts, Alice        \n                 realizes that Wonderland may not be for\n                 her, and that she misses William.\n\n                                                              \n                                                   \n                             \n                                      \n                            -+ Rip Notes +-                      \n                                                              \n\n                  As with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n                before it, kids today are happily walking\n                around thinking Tim Burton's Alice in\n                Wonderland is the one and only version, and\n                certainly the only version worth seeing.\n                Not so.\n\n                  Over the last more than 100 years, countless\n                adaptations of Alice in Wonderland have made\n                it to the big and small screen. Some of these\n                have had a twist, but you'd be hard-pressed\n                to find any single version crossing into as\n                many diverse genres as this one.\n\n                  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's Alice in\n                Wonderland, the musical comedy porno, like\n                only the 70s could have made it! Producer\n                Bill Osco (of Flesh Gordon fame) somehow\n                managed to convince stunningly beautiful\n                Playboy model Kristine DeBell to star in\n                this fun-filled interpretation of a classic\n                children's tale. It stays surprisingly true\n                to its source material, give or take a few\n                hundred raunchy puns and sexual innuendos,\n                and the music is actually catchy! Production\n                value is obviously low with its near-naught\n                budget, but the costumes are elaborate\n                enough that you actually start buying into\n                the story after a while, and you'll be\n                humming those tunes long after the movie\n                ends.\n\n                  Aside from the significant novelty value,\n                the real reason to watch this is Kristine\n                DeBell, in by far her naughtiest role ever.\n                Her innocent acting, combined with her little\n                lost girl looks, makes her perfect for playing\n                Alice in any version. Lucky for us she chose\n                the version where she gets to show her bits!\n                                                               \n                  We've tagged this as the uncut version,      \n                even though that may not be entirely accurate. \n                Uncut is what others are calling it; it *is*   \n                the longest version, and it *does* have all    \n                the hardcore scenes missing from shorter cuts. \n                But that doesn't necessarily add anything as   \n                the hardcore scenes were spliced in years      \n                after original release. If anything it's a     \n                hardcore edit rather than an uncut version.    \n                Any XXX scene where you can't see Ms. DeBell's \n                face is a spliced in body double, and that     \n                includes the now infamous penetration scene.   \n\n                  Nevertheless, it's quite an enjoyable flick  \n                from a different time in porn, when story      \n                actually mattered more than the amount of      \n                silicone and peroxide. You get to see a drop-\n                dead gorgeous Playboy beauty give head and   \n                play with herself, all while singing along to\n           infectious ditties! What more could anyone         \n            ask for?                                             \n                                                                    \n                                                                   \n             ps.

A time of classic kids flicks,                \n          painstaking hand-drawn animation and countless             \n             cheesy low-budget horrors. A time when pop had             \n              a King, and rock had a Queen. A time when special\n              FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of their\n              many tools.\n\n                Driven by nostalgia and memories of better\n              days, we seek to relive those times, and share\n              those memories. While our belief is that the\n              80s represent the very pinnacle of pop culture,\n              we will not limit ourselves to one decade, or\n              any single genre. We will not ignore the movies\n              considered insignificant or even embarrassing by\n              the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece\n              just because it is dated.\n\n                Whereas most groups rely solely on digital\n              sources, there are still thousands of rare and\n              out of print titles, many of which have no\n              planned digital release. We've made it our\n              mission to dig these out, clean them up using\n              the best hardware and techniques available to\n              us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS,\n              Laserdisc or more exotic formats, we're here\n              to bring you the best (and worst!) of decades\n           past. So sit back and enjoy as we uncover and             \n           pay tribute to an age of cinema we will never           \n         get back.                                               \n                                                                     \n                                                               \n                                                     \n                                     \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                           -+  Respect  +-                  \n                                                            \n                                                                \n                  AEN  AEROHOLiCS  ALLiANCE  ARTHOUSE           \n                                                                \n                 BLooDLiTE  BLooDWeiSeR  EPiSODE  FiCO          \n                                                                \n               FLS  FRAGMENT  HkM  HUMANiSM  KYR  MEMETiC       \n                                                                 \n              QiX  SAPHiRE  TheWretched  VH-PROD  VoMiT  xV      \n                                                                 \n                                                                 \n                 Gone But Not Forgotten         \n                                                                 \n                  SiCK  Cheetah-TV  CuNT  TCF  SChiZO            \n                                                                 \n                                                                 \n                   and everyone who truly contributes            \n                                                                 \n                                                              \n       \n                                             \n                  ascii: asphyx!LGF!CPH!SAC!ACiD 2002","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f5a516d07f0f34bcd4114dafb96270e894441e4","amp;dn":"Alice.In.Wonderland.An.X-Rated.Musical.Fantasy.1976.UNCUT.DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f5a516d07f0f34bcd4114dafb96270e894441e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,90,81,109,7,240,243,75,205,65,20,218,251,150,39,14,137,68,65,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
