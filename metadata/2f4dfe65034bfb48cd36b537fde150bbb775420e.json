Rapper Jay-Z appears in a cameo role. It was produced by Roc-A-Fella Films and distributed by Lions Gate Entertainment. Abdul Malik Abbott directed the film and co-wrote its screenplay with Ernest &quot;Tron&quot; Anderson. The film was loosely based on Aaron Jones and the JBM in Philadelphia's drug trade from the late 1980s to early 1990s. The movie was followed by a sequel, State Property 2 which was released three years later in 2005\n\nFrustrated with being broke, Beans (Sigel) decides that the only way to grasp \nthe American Dream is to take it. The film follows Beans and his crew, the ABM, as they take over the city, creating mayhem as their empire builds. Beans now struggles to maintain his family life while bumping heads with opposing gangsters and police. It all comes to a head when he cannot surpass the city's most notorious crew, run by Untouchable J (Jay-Z) and Dame (Dash). The moves Beans and the ABM decide to make come with severe consequences\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCast\n Beanie Sigel - Beans\n Omillio Sparks - Baby Boy\n Memphis Bleek - Blizz\n Damon Dash - 'Boss' Dame\n Sundy Carter - Aisha\n Tyran 'Ty-Ty' Smith - Shareef\n Oschino - D-Nice\n Jay-Z - Untouchable J\n Brother Newz - P-Nut\n Rell - Butter\n Young Chris - Ricky\n Young Neef - Troy\n Amil - Boss' Assassin\n DJ Clue - Boss Informant\n Jacob the Jeweler - Eli\n Casha - Heather McGee\n Randolph Curtis Rand - Saul Weisberg\n Nicole Madeo - Leslie Tucci\n Leslie Pilgrim - Aja\n Kyndra Monet - Selena\n Pain in da Ass - Mario\n Dee Lee - Poochie\n Leah Leatherbury - Tonya\n Reb - Snoop\n Rashie Constantine - Mel\n Stephen 'X' Baker - Bruce\n Willie Esco - Papi Wil\n Cousin Ervan - E\n Andrea Videla - Nina\n\n\nState Property has earned the dubious distinction of being near the top of the list of most &quot;fuck&quot; per minute of any movie (excluding a documentary on the &quot;Fuck&quot; word itself).
